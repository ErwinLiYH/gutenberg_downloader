and their origin According to their beliefs the Great Spirit finished the big task of making the world at this spot The desert was the final work of the Great Spirit and he was much pleased but in his arms he held a big jumble of rocks sand and pigments which were left from the great work The world was all made and very good to look upon so he had no place for this extra material To get rid of it he simply dropped it at his feet in a mass and the many hued pigments spilled over it until the whole was as a bright hued piece of cloth Thus according to the Indians was formed these mountains which are but a jumble of barren rocks rising sheer from the level desert scourged through the centuries by the desert sun wind and sand an unfading proof that unlike man the Great Spirit painted deeper than the surface But with all their gaudy colors in the sun these mountains at night are black silhouettes which appear to be without breadth or thickness or broken into misty hazy unreal piles in the moonlight On all sides the desert stretches away to the haze of nothingness a land of the mirage scenes which the jealous desert steals from arid lands and holds up to the eyes of desert men to lure them on Cities rivers lakes with cool nodding palms rippling brooks which seem only a few feet away then fade out to show a waste of dust gray mesquite which rattles in the hot winds Joshua trees with their agonized arms and sand Always the sand On a rocky plateau of this painted range stood a town one street of adobe shacks paved with the solid rock of the mountain Even the houses were tinted with fantastic colors where the clay had been mixed with the muck of the silver mines At the upper end of the street the cliffs arose sheer for several hundred feet like gaudy drapes of calico At the lower end was a succession of broken ledges which sloped off to the desert where the winding trails came in from the rest of the world To the left of the town was a deep rocky gorge so grotesque in formation that it did not appear to be a work of nature There were natural stone bridges caves barriers unreal in color and design as though a child minded giant had modeled them in colored clay and left them to harden in the blistering sun This was the residence section of Calico Town and was known as Sunshine Alley Just below where the Alley opened onto the desert on a slight rise of ground full in the glare of the sun and with no protection from the ever sifting sand was the graveyard which was known as Hell s Depot Not a blade of grass not even a spray of sage grew here The ground was a mass of small stones seemingly laid close together like tiles but showing patterns in colors that would put any man made mosaic to shame One foot deep was the limit of the graves as the rock below that depth was glass like flint but what the graves lacked in depth was made up in height The mounds of rock were piled until one might believe that the corpse had been of gigantic proportions or that the sexton wished to preclude any chance of the dead coming back in material form Such was Calico in the early fifties when men were gold and silver mad A town of thirty five hundred population a population which lived in caves hollowed places in Sunshine Alley or picked a corner in the rock and builded a rock barrier around them This gave a roofless dwelling but rain did not come to Calico so there was no need for roofs Water was worth more than whiskey and morals were as scarce as orchids Just now a funeral was in progress or rather had been in progress The corpse was there in the rough casket the grave was dug and the pall bearers stood aside reverently holding their hats in their hands Clustered around was a cosmopolitan mining camp audience Frock coated tall hatted gamblers rubbed elbows with muck stained miners Calico clad wives of miners children dogs and even a group of burros poked onto the flat to add their faces to the mournful proceedings Up the desert trail came two men and a lightly packed burro all of them gray with the dust and heat The one who led the caravan was a mighty weatherbeaten man with a long white beard In appearance he might have been a saint Surely he could not be a sinner with the eyes of a dreamer the nose of a prophet and the beard of a saint but nature does queer things to disappoint students of physiognomy The other man was also tall His face showed him to be about thirty years of age a face seemingly hewed from stone although handsome in its stern mold His hair was black and he wore it low between his cheek and ear There was the free easy swing to his walk like the half lope of a desert wolf The patriarch halted the caravan on the trail just short of the street end and gazed across at the funeral The younger man glanced over there with little show of interest Duke the old man jerked his head toward the graveyard I reckon they re plantin somebody Let s me and you go over They left their burro on the trail and crossed over attracting little attention The crowd seemed to be waiting for someone Two men were standing near the grave talking earnestly Suddenly one of them looked up and saw the newcomers He walked abruptly away from his companion and halted a few feet from the white bearded man Podner by yore whiskers yo re a preacher are yuh The bearded one s right hand came up and slowly stroked the white mass of hair which hung nearly to his waist line By my beard nodded the old man slowly which neither affirmed nor denied in fact but seemed to bring joy to the heart of his questioner who turned on his heel facing the crowd Folks we re playin in luck The funeral will proceed jist like nothin happened extraordinary Just a moment pardner said the bearded one What happens to be the matter Not a damn thing laughed the man We needed a preacher awful bad you showed up There yuh are Have you no preacher We did have Yessir we shore had a reg lar one and he was plumb tidy and slick on funerals yessir But he forgot himself complete like last night when he lowed there wasn t no honest rules of averages which gives him small cards all the time while Ace Ault get nothin smaller than kings up in ten deals Hm m m the white bearded one almost smiled Where is this poker playin preacher now Well hell s delight grunted the other He s in the casket We plumb forgot that he couldn t say his own oration That s where you comes in handy like a gun in a boot The patriarch s head turned slightly and his eyes flashed to the face of his companion who was regarding him with stony countenance although the eyes twitched slightly at the outer corners a sure sign that Duke Steele was greatly amused The bearded one crossed to the grave and looked down at the rough coffin while the audience moved in closer A burro brayed raucously and two more of the long eared beasts added their brazen throats to the racket A miner heaved a rock against the ribs of the nearest beast and the animal clattered away for a few jumps looking back solemnly sadly Friends the bearded man s voice was deep and musical as he lifted his bared head and let his eyes travel around the assemblage friends I have been asked to say a few words over the mortal remains of one of God s anointed a man who has labored in this land of sin and sinners that the Gospel might be brought home to you all He was fearless in his righteousness a guide friend and spiritual counselor He is with you no more except in spirit but his many good works will live long after his name has been forgotten I can see him now a bulwark of strength to the weak a solace to the suffering and a friend to all mankind I can see him Wait a moment parson interrupted the man who had asked the bearded one to deliver the sermon He stepped forward hat in hand clearing his throat apologetically I ain t no hand to stop a feller from sayin what he thinks but did you know Preacher Bill Bushnell The old man shook his head No I did not know him friend I didn t reckon yuh did parson We did I believe in sayin everythin good yuh can fer a dead man but there ain t no use of yuh lyin to us about Preacher Bill The old man glanced down at the coffin lifted his head slowly and nodded If the Lord is willing I will take back what I said about him and start all over again Wasn t he your minister Did he not labor among you He preached admitted a bearded miner seriously and added when he was sober enough He owed everybody in Calico and if he left any good works he sure had em cached where nobody ll ever find em The bearded man nodded slowly and cleared his throat Under those conditions friends I suppose I might as well keep away from personalities and stick to the ordinary burial service Has anyone a Bible The assemblage looked at each other and back at the bearded one Preacher Bill had one once stated a frock coated gambler I dunno what he done with it If you re a preacher where is your Bible The bearded one glanced quickly at the gambler and held out his hand Let me have a deck of cards will you Cards queried the gambler I have no cards Then you are no better heeled than I am partner I have no Bible you have no cards He leaned down and placed a hand on the rough casket Preacher Bill I wish I had known you well enough to have something to say about you No doubt you were a hard drinker of very little value to any community and showed poor judgment in objecting audibly against a run of bad poker luck but no man can live through childhood and well into life s narrow span without doing some good leaving somebody better for having known you Let him who is without sin cast the first stone Good by Preacher Bill The bearded man straightened up and looked at the crowd Friends I ask you to try and remember the good things he has done and forget the bad We are all children of circumstance The Bible says The son of man goeth as it is written of him Whether or not this means that our destiny is all written out in the good book I do not know Perhaps poor Preacher Bill merely traveled according to what had been written of him powerless to do otherwise Shall we say that he was unfit I think that is all I can say Parson one of the miners stepped out of the crowd and held out his hand to the old man if you start a church here I ll sure as hell go to hear yuh preach The old man smiled sadly shook hands with several of the miners and turned back to where Duke Steele stood They looked closely at each other turned and went back to their burro without a word while the mortal remains of Preacher Bill Bushnell were lowered one foot deep into Hell s Depot and piled high with heavy stones Le Saint said Duke Steele as they plodded toward the street I wonder what will be said over your remains The old man turned his head and glanced back toward the group at the cemetery I wonder Duke Perhaps I shall be lucky enough to have my funeral oration spoken by a man who did not know me any better than I knew Preacher Bill Will he say This is Paget Le Saint or will he say The Saint I wonder Still what should I care Duke Damn little difference it makes after a man s dead nodded Duke Steele True as Gospel Duke Life is the only thing that interests me death I know nothing about nor care And the Saint spoke truly when he said he did not care for the Saint was a fatalist a gambler who staked his life against other men s gold Just as surely as Kidd and Morgan were pirates of the seas the Saint was a pirate of the Desert whose appearance belied his calling Men seemed to speak softly in his presence as though awed by the majesty of his face and great white beard Oaths never passed his lips and no man had ever seen him take a drink of liquor He censured no man for doing evil and his open philosophy of life fitted in well with the rough lands of the West No man except Duke Steele knew the real business of the Saint and he knew only because they were of a kind Duke Steele was a gunman a killer a gambler and he alone knew that the Saint was all of these An old wolf in the raiment of a sheep as resourceful and dangerous as an old wolf and with the brain of a Solomon But no man not excepting Duke Steele knew anything more about the Saint than they had observed from contact with him for he confided in no man He had wandered much and at times would mention distant parts of the country Names seemed to interest him greatly names of men It was as though he was always searching for a certain name which he could only remember by hearing it spoken Duke Steele wondered at times if the Saint was not just a trifle insane For he was a strange personality at times given to brooding violence turning in a flash to extreme kindness and good humor He often spoke his own name as though mocking himself But of his ancestry his early life he made no mention Duke Steele had been one of his gang in a raid on the Cohise mines which had been skilfully planned and executed and without the loss of a man Three weeks before the Saint s outfit had boasted of twelve men Where the other ten were now could only be told by a bunch of Apaches who ambushed them beyond the Colorado The Saint and Duke Steele were the only ones to escape The plunder of the Cohise mining camp had been taken by the Indians and the Saint and Steele were forced to be content with saving their lives and one burro But Steele was an optimist and the Saint did not care for money It meant nothing to him Men believed him insane at times because of his total disregard for wealth He would nurse a sick man with all the tenderness of a woman or kill a malcontent with the cold bloodedness of a tiger But travel he must His eyes ever turned toward the hills as though he was wondering what was on the other side A prospector had told them of Calico and to Calico they had come with not a drop of water nor a crumb of food left The Lord must be looking out for us observed Duke Steele as they herded their burro up the main street Fate corrected the Saint The Lord has nothing to do with this place Duke It looks like the devil might have located it did one or two assessments and relinquished it on account of the heat A man crossed the street ahead of them and the Saint stopped him with the question Friend can you tell us where we may find lodging Lodging The man parroted the word There ain t a hotel in Calico Better see Sleed I reckon Since Preacher Bill got killed there s a vacant hole in Sunshine Alley and maybe yuh can rent it from Sleed And who is Sleed asked the Saint Who The man looked curiously at them Yuh must be strangers in this part of the country if yuh don t know who Sleed is He s the big man around here Owns the Silver Bar saloon over there and owns the California at Cactus City Owns the Lady Slipper and the Nola mines which are the biggest producers here Sleed was one of the original locators and he sure does own this town y betcha He owns the hole yuh spoke about queried Steele Yep owns most all of the Alley You just ask for Silver Sleed over at the Silver Bar saloon S funny yuh never heard of Silver Sleed No doubt nodded the Saint Our sources of information appear very lax in not apprising us of this great personage Still it is never too late to meet the great We both thank you friend The Saint turned the burro toward the front of the Silver Bar saloon while their informant shuffled his feet in the gravel street and wondered whether or not the old patriarch was making fun of him The Saint was not over fifty years of age but looked seventy Silver Sleed was a giant of a man with a great black beard which grew almost to his eyes eyes that reflected a greenish light like the sheen of jade He wore his hair long after the fashion of the time and his clothes were a trifle extreme but befitted his occupation and position as the richest and most powerful man in the country The law had never penetrated the Calico hills so Silver Sleed set himself up as judge and arbiter from which there was no appeal In all cases which did not directly or indirectly affect himself or his interests he was fair in his decisions The Silver Bar saloon was not a pretentious place being one story high built of adobe but it was the largest building in Calico The floor space was about forty feet wide by sixty feet deep which was taken up by a long bar gambling layouts and a dance floor It was the only saloon in Calico which was conclusive evidence that Sleed owned the town Calico spoke many languages but among this polyglot of tongues only one Louie Yen spoke Chinese Sleed did not like Chinese so he limited the camp to Louie Yen who was a velly good laundly yessum Louie was so old that he claimed to remember the time when Ruby Hill was nothing but a hole in the ground old and very wise after his own fashion But no man may rule a community without assistance Sleed surrounded himself with a few trusted men who were paid for doing certain things without asking the why and wherefore men who might be undesirable to a village of God fearing folk but passing unnoticed in Calico where according to the parlance of Sunshine Alley everything went except the cook stove and one joint of pipe Just now Sleed was standing with his back to the bar in the saloon his eyes squinted as though in deep thought Beside him stood a slender dark featured man dressed in the habiliments of the professional gambler His black eyes were sullen and shifty and his long fingers moved nervously at his sides as he flashed a sidewise glance at Sleed That s your idea of a square deal is it Sleed Sleed turned his head and looked coldly at the gambler Ace Ault this ain t no deal You killed Preacher Bill because well not because he said yuh dealt a crooked game but because yuh was jealous Jealous hell snapped Ault He said I know what he said interrupted Sleed coldly It gave yuh the chance yuh wanted Ault Preacher Bill was a dirty old bum and his tongue was against him but he was educatin Luck He was smart and he was learnin her a lot of things She liked him And because I protected my honor against his lying tongue I ve got to leave the camp eh queried Ault sarcastically Honor Sleed laughed into his beard Honor Good God when did a tinhorn like you get any honor Ault s face went a trifle darker and he lifted his hands to a level with his waist You travel muy pronto snapped Sleed Better go north Ault so yuh won t have any reason even to pass Calico town again Think so snapped Ault His right hand flashed up from under his coat From across the room came the jarring thud of a pistol shot and Ault jerked back firing his pistol a foot over Sleed s head For a moment Ault s eyes shifted around the room as he grasped at the bar for support half turned toward the door and fell sprawling One of Sleed s men came slowly across the room pistol in hand watching Ault closely Sleed s expression had not changed Quick work Loper he said softly Loper nodded and shoved his gun back into its holster Just then the Saint and Duke Steele came into the door Sleed looked at them indifferently and motioned for some more men to assist in carrying Ault s body out of the place The Saint and Steele stood aside and watched the men file out Silver Sleed asked Steele Sleed looked at him for a moment glanced toward the door as he nodded Some of the men who had been at the graveyard were coming in looking curiously back at the men carrying Ace Ault We re lookin for a place to live in said Steele A man told us to see Silver Sleed Yeah Sleed squinted at the Saint and back to Steele Whatcha goin to do in Calico You didn t expect an answer to that did yuh asked Steele with a smile Sleed grunted softly One of the men from the graveyard stepped in and spoke to Sleed The graybeard s a preacher Sleed He said a few things for Preacher Bill and they was damn well said after he got put right Sleed looked at the Saint curiously and found the Saint looking straight at him Something in that glance seemed to bother Sleed It was as though this tall white bearded hawk eyed man was peering into things that Sleed did not want anyone to see Sleed glanced down at the floor for a moment and nodded I reckon there s places to live in Yuh can have Preacher Bill s place or yuh can have Sleed looked up and glanced toward the door I think yuh can have the place where Ace Ault lived We both thank you sir The Saint s voice boomed like the deep notes of a pipe organ Sleed glanced quickly at him and saw that the Saint s eyes were closed as though he had shut out material things while he thought deeply I ll show em the places Sleed It was the miner who had offered to come to church in case the Saint would do the preaching Sleed nodded and turned back to the bar but he watched the three men go out of the door Loper who are them two men he asked I dunno Loper shook his head Find out Sleed turned back to the bar and called for whiskey For some unknown reason he was worried The killing of Ault amounted to nothing He discarded that as a possible reason for his unrest Was it the white bearded man Sleed scowled at his glass of liquor for a moment and placed it back on the bar untasted II The Saint and Steele found that there was little choice between the two dwellings but they selected the one made vacant by the death of Preacher Bill It was a roofless windowless rock hut about ten feet square built in an angle of the canyon which supplied two of the walls An open fireplace was used for cooking and the utensils were either placed on rock shelves or on the ground Preacher Bill s blankets were still spread from his last night s sleep but the larder was empty I reckon yuh can get along said their guide I m Jim Cates but most everybody calls me Mica S I said before if yuh start preachin I m goin t have a front seat He started away but turned back Say if yuh get a call to speak over the remains of Ace Ault I can tell yuh a few things to make yore oration easier Ault was crooked as a snake in a cactus patch He never Mica Cates stopped talking and cleared his throat A girl had come up near the doorway and was looking at them She was about twenty years of age fairly well dressed A pair of big brown eyes misty with tears looked at them from a cameo like face which was framed in a mass of brown hair Her cheeks were streaked with tear marks and her lips quivered as she looked around Then she turned without a word and disappeared around the canyon wall Sleed s daughter said Cates softly Her name is Nola but Sleed said she was his luck so many times that everybody calls her Luck Been cryin said Steele wonderingly Uh huh Mebbe yuh didn t see her down to Hell s Depot She was there I reckon she was the only one to care about Preacher Bill Yuh see she ain t had no chance to learn book teachin s until Preacher Bill took to learnin her He was eddicated a lot and she sure wanted to learn Steele nodded She s a mighty pretty girl Cates And nother thing said Cates softly yuh don t want to have nothin t do with her Sleed s a killer where Luck s concerned Mebbe that s one reason why Ault got a ticket for the Depot Jist let her alone and don t cross Silver Sleed and you ll git along here What did yuh say yore names was The Saint held out his hand and Cates shook hands with him flinching from the crushing grip of the Saint s hand We both thank you Mica Cates boomed the Saint If I preach in Calico town I shall deem it a pleasure to see you in the front row Mica Cates bobbed his head and hurried away He flexed his right hand and shook his head My Gawd I never knowed a preacher with a grip like that nossir I didn t find out their names and I m danged if I d ever ask any man twice Cates climbed back up the rocky trail to the street where he met Loper Where did they hole up asked Loper Preacher Bill s place Ask em their names Mica Y betcha I did What names did they give yuh Mica Cates glanced back down the trail wiped the perspiration off his brow with the back of his hand They ain t givin away names I reckon Yuh asked em didn t yuh snapped Loper angrily Y betcha I did Mebbe they didn t hear me I dunno Loper hitched up his belt and strode back to the street It was very hot and he had no desire to climb down into Sunshine Alley and argue about names III We ve got a home said Duke Steele dubiously as he leaned against the rough stone doorway squinting in the reflected light from the desert sun but when we got there the cupboard was bare Yes nodded the Saint but how long have we fasted Duke Since breakfast He pointed at the hills above them dotted with tunnels where a host of men drove into the bowels of the earth Came the dull jar of blasting the rattle of falling rock from the ever growing dumps Men are toiling up there Duke while down on the street another group of non toilers are planning to get the fruits of that labor without toil You and I do not toil therefore we must use our brains to devise ways and means to get the necessary provender Just about how queried Duke The Saint unrolled some of his meager belongings on the stone floor and in the center of it all was a small package The Saint picked this up and got to his feet Duke it has been seldom that I have had to stoop to their use but when I am forced to such an extremity they never fail Meaning what smiled Duke The Saint unrolled the small package and held in his hand two halves of a walnut empty of all meat and polished to a mahogany finish In one of the halves was a polished black object about the size of a garden pea The tools of a cheap gambler said the Saint studying Duke s dubious expression Yet one must be dexterous and have the courage of his calling Where does the game come in asked Duke The Saint knelt down on a blanket smoothed it out and placed the two shells open side down He slipped the black pea under one of the shells and with a rapid twist of his hand and fingers shuffled the shells for a moment Which one is it under Duke he asked Duke indicated the one and the Saint lifted the shell There was no pea under it The Saint repeated the process slower this time and Duke Steele was willing to bet his neck on picking the right shell but he was mistaken Is it under the other shell Saint he asked That is hardly a fair question Duke Just supposing I had opened my game and a bettor had picked the other shell Would it be good policy to have the pea under that shell In our financial condition we cannot afford to take any great chances and I know of no smaller chances of losing than by operating the two little walnut shells Duke nodded shortly I reckon that s right Saint Looks to me like Sleed has this place under his thumb I suppose he s got every gunman working for him which makes it a poor place for us The Saint placed the two shells in his pocket and came to the doorway The setting sun slanted against the expanse of Ruby Hill bringing out a myriad of colors until the whole land seemed to be a vast drop curtain of fantastic shades The voices of men drifted down to them as clear cut as the tinkling of bells The rasp of a pick the clank of hammer on steel seemed to come from the air above them and at no great distance And like the dimming of a great light the sun moved its rays swiftly up the side of the mountain leaving in its track a misty softness almost as blue as moonlight Blast after blast seemed to jar the world as the last shots of the afternoon were fired A few moments later like ants coming from their burrows the men came from their tunnels and down the steep hillside while from Sunshine Alley the supper fires sent up long straight streamers of smoke to signal them home Men will always toil said the Saint as though talking to himself Toil day after day until their span of life is done and after them their sons will take up the toil and carry it on And what does it all mean Will the work that these men are doing amount to anything in the final scheme of things Will the sweat of their brows and the callouses on their hands mean anything Is there a reason for things I wonder Duke He turned and put his hand on Steele s shoulder I have no conscience no morals I have killed like the wolf kills and yet I have no fear of death only wonder I have studied men from the frozen North to the tropics I know their different breeds languages customs I have seen a Cree chief die and I have seen the passing of a Yaqui brave I have seen the mystery of the unknown come into the eyes of a learned man and I have held the wrist of a dying degenerate They all die alike Duke Never have I seen a man who did not fight against the death and I have never seen one pass into the borderland with a smile of welcome Always that mystery Sometimes I wonder if death is a punishment The fear of death is punishment to most men no matter who they are A minister of the Gospel fights against the hand of death as strongly as the worst sinner ever bred and why The hereafter is a mystery life is just as great a mystery Duke nodded solemnly I reckon you re right Saint I kinda feel sorry for Sleed s girl The Saint looked down at the rocky floor and smiled in his great beard Life is no mystery to youth and you are only thirty years of age Duke But don t feel sorry for Sleed s girl In the first place she is Sleed s girl in the second place you are Duke Steele Duke swung away from the doorway and looked up the hill toward the town He turned and looked at the Saint I I reckon you re right Saint I kinda forgot IV It can t be beat friends The more you put down the less you take up Never buck another man s game because it was not invented to lose money for its owner The gent bets five that he can pick the right shell One at a time gents This is a one man game unless you both want to bet on the same shell Empty again gents Where s the next man who is foolish enough to think he can beat a sure thing game The Saint s voice boomed softly as he pocketed the bet and slowly moved the two walnut shells The yellow light from the Silver Bar windows lit up his white hair and white beard as he lifted himself to his full height and studied the crowd in the street The Saint had secured a small rough table which he had placed in the street using the lights from the saloon to illuminate his game A big moon peeping over Ruby Hill lit up the street in a soft blue haze broken by the blocky shadows of the rough buildings and shot here and there by the yellow lights from oil lamp or candle The narrow street was thronged with people for Sunshine Alley moved to the main street at night Money was plentiful and the toilers threw it away living only in the present The shell game was new to Calico and Calico was anxious to welcome something new Men jostled each other for a chance to place a bet while the Saint s voice boomed a warning to each and all It can t be beat brother The hand is quicker than the eye Another empty shell Don t nobody ever win asked a miner Nobody brother Again I say to you all it can t be beaten The crowd laughed It was unusual for a game keeper to declare that no one can beat his game The Saint was deadly serious and this amused the crowd Another man who had watched several bets swept from the table moved in and tossed several gold pieces beside the shells Pick up your money friend urged the Saint You can t win Might as well toss your money into the dust and walk away from it All right if you insist Thank you for the present The man turned away and went toward the saloon door Duke Steele had been watching the game and now he moved in closer to the Saint who dug into his pocket and handed Duke a fistful of money Take a spin at the wheel son I don t want to take all of Silver Sleed s business away from him I reckon Sleed can stand it better than we can laughed a miner who had donated liberally to the elusive black pea Duke moved out of the crowd and started for the saloon door when he came face to face with Sleed s Luck The girl was standing on the raised step of the saloon watching the crowd around the Saint but now she looked straight at Duke who removed his sombrero slowly He wanted to speak to her but turned and started on into the Silver Bar realizing that he had never met her Wait she said softly and he stopped Loper came out of the door and walked to the edge of the steps looking toward the crowd in the street You wanted to speak to me asked Duke Yes I want to speak to you about him She motioned toward the Saint as she spoke My pardner queried Duke Yes I I heard him at the graveyard today Is he a preacher He can preach said Duke slowly He has been educated said the girl as though talking to herself He must know a lot of things Yes m he sure does nodded Duke and might have added that the Saint would have been hanged many times for divulging even a part of what he knew I wonder if I could talk to him she said quickly Not tonight tomorrow maybe Yes m I reckon yuh could We re livin where Preacher Bill used to live Luck nodded I saw you there Preacher Bill was my friend What is his name She motioned toward the Saint Le Saint Le Saint she said softly I thought of him that way when I saw him at the graveyard My father let Preacher Bill teach me things and I wonder my father is down at Cactus City tonight You ve lived here a long time asked Duke Two years Mighty long time to live here observed Duke Luck nodded slowly A long time yes Nothing but heat in the day and this She gave a weary gesture toward the street at night I have lived in the North where the mountains are big and cool where there are big trees and rivers It is never cool here At times it is a dreary cold then the heat Duke nodded and looked up at the moon hanging like a great ball only a short distance above the hill Suddenly an altercation started across the street beyond the crowd around the Saint A babble of voices a curse shrilled in a woman s voice a shot Duke turned quickly to Luck but she had disappeared in the crowd A man elbowed his way across the street laughing as he reached the door and spoke to Loper Woman fer a change Loper Tejon Mary tried to knife a feller but he was lookin fer it and shot her S time somebody stopped her grunted Loper She was loco Sleed was goin t ship her out anyway The crowd around the shell game began to scatter and look for another diversion Duke went out to the Saint whose pockets were bulging with money Game is closed said the Saint putting the shells in his pocket and picking up the table and again we have a stake He placed the table in the alleyway between the Silver Bar and the adjoining building I was surprised not to have Silver Sleed try to stop my game said the Saint as he joined Duke He s in Cactus City tonight Saint I had a talk with his daughter Sleed s Luck Yeah Son it is none of my business began the Saint but Duke stopped him and the Saint listened closely while Duke told him what the girl had said He shook his white beard slowly when Duke finished I reckon said Duke slowly I reckon you ve just about got to start in where Preacher Bill left off Tomorrow mused the Saint Tonight I would refuse to consider it tomorrow is another day A man is a fool to declare his intentions more than one minute into the future Let us procure food Duke Steele after that we will sleep It has been a long day From within the saloon came the squeak of a fiddle the tinpanny rattle of a piano the scrape of boots The dance had begun Several men were going down the street carrying a blanketed figure which had been Tejon Mary who was loco From far out in the barren hills a coyote yapped dismally Sleed came back from Cactus City the next day came back like a sore headed grizzly looking for trouble He had drunk heavily played poker all night and the heat of the day had ground his temper to a razor edge Men kept away from Silver Sleed when he was in this humor but he soon heard of the shell game which had held the attention of the crowd the night before and his face purpled with rage He cursed everyone in sight and sent for Loper who was almost as sore headed as his master Sleed took him to the rear of the room sat him down at a table and demanded an explanation How could I stop him demanded Loper I ain t Sleed The crowd liked his game cause he told em all that it can t be beat How much did he win growled Sleed I dunno Prob ly about two hundred dollars Tejon Mary got shot and that kinda busted up the crowd Sleed leaned back and licked the edge of a frayed cigar while he waited for Loper to explain more I seen Luck talkin to the other fellow Sleed snapped the cigar aside and leaned across the table Luck was talkin to this old man s pardner Yeah What about I dunno all they talked about Sleed I didn t want to move in too close but I know she was askin him about the old man About the old man parroted Sleed What did she want to know about him I dunno You dunno mimicked Sleed Is there anythin you do know Wasn t your ears workin I told yuh I didn t want to move in close Sleed I heard some of it and Oh you heard some of it did yuh Sleed got ponderously to his feet and leaned both hands on the table as he snarled down at Loper You heard some of it but you don t know what they talked about Loper licked his lips and wished that the interview was over Luck asked him what the old man s name was and What was it snapped Sleed Le Saint Silver Sleed stared down at Loper stared curiously vacantly He lifted one hand and brushed it across his lips while his fixed gaze seemed to look through Loper and beyond Loper shifted nervously but Sleed continued to stare Suddenly he jerked like a man awaking from sleep and sat down slowly in a chair Le Saint he muttered softly Funny first name said Loper slowly Paget I think he called it Must be a furriner Silver Sleed did not seem to hear him I dunno what the other feller s name is but he sure looks like he could take care of himself Packs a gun that looks like it had been used a plenty and he s got the walk of a cat The old man s gun ain t no ornyment either Mebbe he s a preacher I dunno Sleed continued to stare at the table top Want me to pack a talk to him asked Loper I can tell him to put out of here or that he can t run no game in Calico No Sleed shook his head slowly and leaned closer to Loper Do yuh know anythin about that shell game Only that it can t be beat Of course it can t admitted Sleed hoarsely That pea ain t under either shell Suppose that you bet a lot of money on the pea bein under one of them shells and it wasn t there and yuh grabbed the other one and found it empty Sleed grinned wolfishly What would yuh do Loper That s it eh grunted Loper I reckon I d take my money back Which might start trouble Thasall right grunted Loper I d be lookin for trouble Sleed got to his feet and jerked his head toward the bar as an invitation to have a drink Let this man set up his game tonight if he wants to I reckon you know what to do Loper Loper nodded Uh huh But have somebody watchin this other feller Sleed he s dangerous y betcha Some of the boys will take care of him Maybe I ll watch him myself Sleed spilled his liquor in the pouring but filled his glass to the brim while Loper wondered what had happened to Steed s iron nerve He wondered if his boss were losing his nerve or if it were only the effects of too much liquor and loss of sleep Got any more orders for today asked Loper Sleed shook his head splashing the liquor from his glass into his beard Then he tossed the half empty glass over the bar and walked out of the door Guess that whisky don t set well on his stummick today observed the bartender kicking the broken glass aside Somethin don t admitted Loper seriously He s drinkin too much I reckon You better mention it to him grinned Loper He s in good shape for a temp rance lecture right now F he ever gets snakes It ll be hell on the snakes finished Loper V Long strings of mules driven with a jerk line and hauling heavy clumsy ore wagons drifted out of Sunshine Alley hauling great loads of silver ore to the mills at Cactus City fifteen miles away It was a hard journey across the desert to Cactus City but water was necessary for the handling of the ore and Calico had none Many of the wagons brought back great casks of water to supply Calico There was no ice The cool of the evening lowered the temperature of the water a trifle but a cold drink was unknown in Calico town in summer Duke Steele and the Saint had stocked their larder from one of the stores and had secured several badly needed blankets A passing wagon had sold them a small cask of water at a large price but they were willing to pay The burro had joined forces with several more of its kind which were trying to eke out a living in the Alley by devouring anything and everything from an old newspaper to a much boiled bone At times as though by signal they would all bray together their raucous voices echoing brazenly from the cliffs Mica Cates came down the road and stopped at sight of Duke and the Saint They took Ault and Tejon Mary to Cactus City he announced Ault had some friends in Cactus and Sleed didn t want Mary buried here Cates laughed and added Mebbe Sleed was afraid Mary s ghost might not be welcome among so many good ones Is Cactus City any better than Calico asked Duke Better morals nodded Mica They don t have a killin down there more n once a week You stay here and you ll find a plenty of funerals to work on Ain t no money in it as far as I can see but Preacher Bill had a system He orated at funerals fer nothin quite a while and one day he whittled out a cross and fastened it to a headstone She looked kinda pious A gambler who was religious as hell saw him put up this here cross so the gambler takes up a collection fer old Bill I reckon he got a hundred dollars fer him and after that old Bill packs a cross with him all the time and hopes for a killin Cates grinned and went on up the road He was like a daily paper to Calico and spent most of his time retailing news picking up new items at each stop and telling hearsay as personal experience Duke Steele turned from watching Cates and saw Luck coming slowly down the trail toward their adobe The Saint glanced up at the girl and back at Duke who was smiling at her She came shyly up to them and Duke introduced her to the Saint She was even prettier in the harsh light of day than in the dim lights of the night before I I wanted to talk to you she faltered looking at the Saint She traced a pattern with her toe in the sand and seemed undecided just what else to say I think I understand nodded the Saint You want to learn and you think I am capable of teaching you Is that it Yes eagerly Preacher Bill taught me some But he s gone now and I I wondered He wasn t a good man like you but he wanted to help me You see I have never been to a regular school The Saint turned his head slowly and looked at Duke Steele Somehow it did not seem funny to them The Saint turned back to her and said And why do you think I am better than Preacher Bill I don t know she admitted softly I don t know how I know you are but I do Preacher Bill had a Bible with pictures in it and you look like one of them Preacher Bill said it was the picture of a saint The Saint lifted his head and stared up the Alley shutting his eyes against the glare of the reflected light while the girl watched him eagerly He turned and looked at her Why don t your father send you where there are schools He can afford it Luck shook her head Preacher Bill wanted him to send me away but he only laughs and says he can t afford to lose his luck He says I bring him luck I guess he believes this He talks about it so much that nobody ever calls me Nola any more Where is your mother child asked the Saint Luck shook her head I don t know Dad never talks about her and when I ask him he gets angry I don t remember her I remember that we lived in the North where it gets cold and where there are big mountains Since then we have traveled all over the country Dad and I You ain t had much of life that s a cinch muttered Duke Feller hadn t ought to drag a girl over the country like that Bad enough for a boy Luck shut her lips tightly for a moment and then I guess I can stand it Dad says he is going to get me some books Ace Ault wanted to get me some but Dad put a damper on that idea Dad didn t like Ace Perhaps your dad won t like me suggested the Saint Well Luck hesitated a moment I ll tell him about you and will you teach me if he don t mind The Saint looked quizzically at her and his eyes shifted to a far away look as though he were undecided Then he nodded Yes child if he don t mind Luck turned quickly and ran up the trail as though she was going to lose no time in finding out Duke smiled after her and looked at the Saint who was staring down at the ground his hands clenched at his sides The face of a saint was gone now and in its stead was the grinning snarl of an old wolf He lifted his face and looked at Duke Steele who was staring at the change in the old man s face and manner Duke Steele the Saint s voice was thin almost a whine I ve lived to kill kill do you hear me Now I ve promised God why did I He swung his head as though in pain and walked away Duke watched him going slowly down the road his shoulders hunched as though the weight of the world rested on his back Whom did he live to kill Why did his promise to Luck change his whole being Duke frowned and tried to gather some reason for the old man s feelings but in vain The Saint left the road and climbed the hill to a pinnacle of rock where he sat and stared down the canyon chin in hands like a great white headed eagle watching for its prey It was an hour later that the Saint came back He seemed older whiter and very tired Duke made no mention of what had passed between them and the Saint did not open the subject He sat down in the doorway and examined his revolver an old single action Colt scarred and polished from much usage His long lean fingers seemed to caress the old gun lovingly There were no notches on the butt of this old gun but Duke Steele knew that its muzzle had spouted death many times Suddenly Duke spoke Saint what made you old before your time Old Before my time The Saint turned his head and looked at Duke Uh huh You ain t over fifty are yuh You ain t got no right to wear long white hair and whiskers and make folks think you re as old as the hills The Saint ran his hand under his beard and lifted it in range of his eyes For several moments he peered at it as though he had never seen it before Duke what would I look like without this beard I ain t got the slightest idea Saint It sure does cover your face and head And that said Saint slowly is your answer son VI Luck found her father at home asleep but her news was of such importance that she awoke him He snarled an answer to her call before he realized who had called him I ve got a new teacher she announced when she had recovered from the effects of his snarling answer Teacher eh Who The old man with the white beard Le Saint Le Sleed sat up on the bed and stared at her Luck nodded Le Saint He looks like one of the old men in the Bible He is going to teach me if you will let him Sleed stared down at the floor with unseeing eyes while Luck s words seemed to run in a meaningless jumble through his mind We need a preacher here said Luck softly and he is very good and kind Will you let him teach me Daddy Sleed roused from his stupor and got heavily to his feet Don t you feel good asked Luck Your face is so white and your eyes No I m all right grunted Sleed thickly I I lost a lot of sleep and this blasted heat He wiped his brow with the sleeve of his shirt Are we going to live here always asked Luck Always Sleed tried to smile Always is a long time Luck Sleed picked up his hat and started for the door but Luck took him by the arm You did not say about my teacher Sleed did not look at her as he said When is he goin to start teachin Luck Tomorrow eagerly Oh tomorrow I reckon that ll be all right tomorrow Sleed went out of the door and Luck watched him go down the rocky trail to the street but he did not turn and wave at her as he usually did Suddenly he stopped turned and came slowly back up the trail to the doorway Luck I wish you d stay off the street tonight he said Why she asked It was the first time he had ever requested her to keep away from the street I m afraid yuh might get hurt There s a bunch comin up from Cactus City tonight and they might get rough I can t afford to have anything happen to my Luck They all know me said Luck quickly Nothing will harm me Sleed shook his head I I dunno about that Luck If trouble started nobody knows where bullets will hit Luck brushed the hair away from her eyes and glanced down toward the quiet street Everybody says that you own Calico Dad If you do why don t you stop the trouble Does there have to be somebody killed every day Isn t there some way to stop men from fighting and killing each other Silver Sleed shook his head No I don t reckon there is not now Maybe some day the wolf blood will thin out I dunno And without gaining Luck s promise to keep off the street that night Sleed turned and went back down the trail Luck watched him disappear and turned to see Mica Cates coming down past the house on his way from the Ruby Hill trail He took off his hat and mopped his brow Howdy Miss Luck Hot ain t it I been circ latin around quite a bit Wes Marks jist run into a two inch vein of durned near pure silver Could almost mint dollars out of the raw stuff Two miners from the Nola had a devil of a fight and one s got a busted head Didja notice how many buzzards has been floatin around t day Been a whole flock of em circlin Calico fer two hours That old white bearded hombre was settin on a rock fer a long time like he was thinkin a heap and then I seen him oilin his six gun Mebbe he s a preacher I dunno Mica Cates stopped for breath and glanced up at the sky where a flock of buzzards circled slowly and without visible effort Cates lowered his eyes and glanced at Luck S hard to fool a buzzard he said and went on down the trail He had fulfilled his duty and added a prophecy to boot Luck s eyes followed the buzzards for a while as they circled slowly on an even plane as though suspended by invisible wires and went back into the house There was something ominous in the atmosphere and Luck had not given her word to keep off the street Loper had passed the word to Bill Fane and Pecos Mendez as to what Silver Sleed expected and the three of them met in the Silver Bar saloon Fane was a tall cadaverous person with a crooked mouth which gave him a perpetual leer Mendez was a half breed whose mentality was hardly up to par but whose pistol ability and cold blooded nerve were seldom equaled We tak care of de yong man eh queried Mendez his voice like the purring of a cat Dat be easy eh Beel Fane nodded absently No killin is easy objected Loper This young man packs a gun like he knowed how to use it and he s got a face that backs up the looks of his gun You two better figure that this ain t goin t be no picnic What does Sleed want em killed fer asked Fane Cause he don t low nobody to cut in on his gamblin in Calico replied Loper He ain t never told em they can t run a game here has he That s none of your business nor mine said Loper Silver Sleed pays yuh don t he Yeah admitted Fane slowly he pays But I m gittin tired of bein hired to shoot folks I ain t no danged milk eater Loper but I believe in lettin a man have a even break You better not let Sleed hear yuh talk thataway cautioned Loper He ain t got no use for that kind of arguments Fane grinned crookedly and put his hand on Loper s arm Loper who are we to let Silver Sleed hire us to do his dirty work Why are we afraid of him What did he ever do to make us afraid of him Either one of us could bump him off with a gun Are we afraid of his damn money I got to lookin him over today and wonderin why we re afraid to speak out loud about him You tell me not to let him hear me talk thataway Why should I be any more afraid to let him hear it than you and Mendez Loper drew away from Fane but the question had found root in his brain Money said Mendez Just money I jus so good as Sleed but Sleed has de money Man got to live I reckon that s it nodded Loper I never thought much about it before Bill I reckon any of us could more than hold his own against Sleed in a gun fight but he s got the money Anyway I told him we d take care of this for him The three of them strolled to the doorway Far out on the desert was a strip of gold marking the last of the sunset but Calico was already hazy with the evening light The Saint and Duke Steele came out of the Alley and into the street walking slowly toward the Silver Bar saloon Them is the ones grunted Loper I dunno what Sleed wants done in case they don t open that game He s doin this cause he wants to stop em from gamblin ain t he queried Fane Loper nodded Mica Cates came thumping down the street and up to the saloon door where he turned and looked up at the sky He shaded his eyes for a moment and turned to the three men Did yuh notice how the buzzards been hangin around here all day What s that got to do with us grunted Loper I dunno admitted Cates I never said who it concerned They ve circled Calico all day and sometimes they come down awful low with their wattled heads turnin from side to side kinda lookin Cates shook his head and started into the saloon but stopped and glanced at the sky again S hard to fool a buzzard y betcha Croakin old pup growled Loper and the three of them went back into the saloon The Saint secured his little table again and set it up in the street Several dogs went out and investigated and started a fight as though there was a serious difference of opinion over the reasons for a table in the street Duke Steele watched the Saint with misgivings He was sure that Silver Sleed would object strenuously to such a proceeding but the Saint gave no heed to his warnings For the last hour the Saint had seemed another person entirely different from the philosophical old man His mop of white hair seemed to lift aggressively and the hawk like nose seemed more like an eagle s beak He had put his extra cartridges in his pocket and shoved his six shooter inside the waistband of his pants where he could get it without reaching under his coat Duke had noted these preparations silently but had looked to his own gun and ammunition He was willing to follow the Saint s lead and he wanted to be prepared for anything Duke went into the saloon and sat down at a poker table where Sleed was dealing a game of stud Sleed studied Duke from under the brim of his hat as he slid a stack of chips across the table to him The limit queried Duke The sky replied Sleed The Saint had split his winnings with Duke and now Duke shoved the rest of the bills over to Sleed taking chips in exchange It was a small betting game and the pots were uninteresting Sleed covered a yawn with his hand and Duke nodded as though at a spoken word Duke smiled grimly as Sleed dealt the first card to each man He shoved in part of a stack of chips and Sleed covered the bet wondering why Duke made such a bet on a hole card The two miners passed leaving Sleed and Duke to fight it out Duke drew a king and Sleed a jack King high bets intoned Sleed Duke shoved in all of his chips Sleed glanced sharply at him but covered the bet and dealt the rest of the hand The result showed a pair of kings for Duke and a pair of jacks for Sleed The next deal doubled Duke s money again and he bet half of it on his hole card Again he won Sleed shifted nervously in his chair while miners crowded in around to watch the play Sleed knew that there was no chance for a crooked play and he trusted to luck to win Pot after pot went to Duke Steele doubling his money on each hand until the onlookers gasped at the wonderful run of luck Duke was plunging betting a fortune on his first card And Sleed s prestige in the town demanded that he follow suit although it broke him Sleed called for another rack of chips new cards whiskey praying that something would happen to break the devilish luck of this hard eyed gambler Another deal and Duke bet two thousand dollars on his first card Sleed glanced at the bet and doubled the size of it Feel it comin on queried Duke It was the first word Duke had spoken since he had inquired about the limit Sleed s eyes narrowed at the question but he did not reply Duke shoved in the extra two thousand and with it went every chip in front of him Stacks of blue and red at five and ten dollars for each chip a king s ransom Sleed licked his lips and studied the pot Your luck or mine said Duke softly You re rich Sleed but are yuh game It s a man sized pot From out on the street came the voice of the Saint It can t be beat folks The more you lay down the less you pick up The hand is quicker than the eye and this game was designed to prove it to you Don t bet unless you want to lose Duke watched Sleed closely as he stared down at the pot It s luck that wins Sleed and you re losin your luck What do you mean snapped Sleed sitting up straight in his chair What do you mean She s leavin you Sleed You know it too Shove in your money and prove it with the cards It s luck now I ll show you my card Duke flipped his hole card disclosing a deuce of hearts The little thin card Sleed Your card must be as good as mine but my luck my medicine is stronger than yours Your luck has left you Like hell it has croaked Sleed and turned his card the ace of spades face up on the table Nervously he shoved in chips calling for another rack to match Duke s bet Deal em face up said Duke softly Give the crowd a little entertainment Sleed Another empty shell came the Saint s voice This is not a luck game folks it is a cinch for the dealer Sleed s hand shook as he started to deal Duke got an ace while Sleed s card showed the five of hearts Slowly the next two fell to the table a five of clubs to Duke and the deuce of diamonds to Sleed Ace five deuce said Duke softly Luck is laughing at you Sleed Sleed tossed the next two and the crowd gasped Each man drew a king Matched cards said Duke laughing softly One more card Sleed one more This one proves that luck has left you Slowly Sleed moved the top card and tossed it across at Duke It was the deuce of clubs making a pair of deuces for Duke Steele An ace king or a five would win for Sleed Friend you are out of luck The Saint s voice seemed to be directed at Silver Sleed I told you that this game cannot be beat but you Sleed spun his card in the air and it fell face up on the pile of chips The trey of spades Staring down at the card Sleed half slumped forward in his chair as he tried to estimate his loss It was more money than he dared estimate He looked up at Duke who was rolling a cigarette Count the chips Sleed said Duke and give me your I O U for it I ll take your count Duke got to his feet and brushed the crumbs of tobacco off the folds of his shirt while Sleed stared up at him His I O U Sleed s eyes shifted and he saw Loper looking at him inquiringly Swiftly Sleed counted the chips stacking them in rows across the table Forty six thousand dollars he said hoarsely Write it out said Duke indifferently Sleed got to his feet and walked to the bar where he secured writing material Laboriously he wrote out the I O U and scrawled his signature at the bottom Without looking at it Duke pocketed it and went out of the door Loper and Fane had moved in close to the bar and as Duke went out of the door Sleed nodded to Loper and indicated for him to go ahead Men were talking softly about the big game the size of Sleed s loss the cold nerve of this stranger A rumble of it came to Sleed s ears and he grinned behind his beard He was sure that he would never have to pay that I O U Voices came from the street arguing laughing quarreling Sleed had turned away as though to go toward the back of the room but he swung around and walked to the door drawn irresistibly by the drama he knew was about to be played VII The Saint was standing at his little table in the center of a crowd advising them not to play his game taking their money when they insisted Duke Steele had elbowed his way to a point just beyond the Saint and was watching the crowd Loper shoved men aside and stepped in front of the table looking curiously down at the two shells Duke had seen Sleed signal Loper in the saloon and he knew that Loper was the one who had killed Ace Ault Loper was Sleed s man and this was their first move against the Saint Don t waste your money friend warned the Saint as Loper took out some gold You can t win Can if I pick the right shell can t I That s the trick friend but it can t be done The Saint rolled the little black pea on the table covered it with a shell and shuffled the shells slowly Fifty dollars declared Loper Pick your shell said the Saint Fifty is a lot of money to give away Loper studied the shells for a moment and made his choice The pea was not there With a swift movement of his hand he upset the other shell and found it empty He stepped back angrily That s a crooked game he roared You just stole my money Loper drew his gun as he rasped out his accusation which was never finished The Saint s hand flashed to his waist a downward and upward movement so fast that it seemed to be one short snap and his pistol spouted fire a second before Loper shot Loper jerked back as though struck by a mighty blow and his bullet sped harmlessly over the Saint s head For an instant the crowd was silent Loper had half caught his balance but it was only an instant before he fell forward on his face Into the startled crowd came Luck running swiftly to the Saint Look out Saint yelled Duke It s a trick to kill you Another pistol thudded from nearer the saloon and the Saint staggered sideways from the shock of the bullet It was Mendez shooting from the sidewalk Duke sprang into a cleared spot and fired twice at Mendez who tried to run but seemed to collapse half way in the saloon door at the feet of Silver Sleed The street cleared as though by magic and Duke could see the Saint on his hands and knees beside his little table trying to pull himself up A woman screamed and a man cursed wonderingly in a high pitched voice As Duke started for the Saint he felt a bullet yank at his shoulder and the crash of a gun came from behind him He turned quickly to see Bill Fane coming toward him Fane shot again before Duke realized that here was another opponent and the bullet seared a furrow across his cheek Duke s hand swung up and he fired quickly Fane stumbled but came on trying to lift his gun which seemed too heavy Again Duke fired and again Fane s gun fell to the ground He seemed to be looking for it searching carefully His knees bent slowly and he sprawled in the street Duke turned around The Saint had got to his feet and was holding to the table with both hands Men were looking out of the saloon door standing far back from the doorway as though afraid to get closer to the street Loper was sprawled on his face just in front of the Saint and had not moved Duke went past him and took the Saint by the arm His white hair and beard were covered with blood and his eyes were closed tightly Come on Saint said Duke Aw this is a hell of a mess ain t it Are yuh hurt bad The Saint mumbled something in his beard but let Duke lead him off the street between two of the buildings Behind them came the sound of voices as the people came back into the street Duke led the Saint around the rear of the buildings until he struck the trail into the Alley His face was bleeding and a dull pain in his shoulder apprised him of the fact that the first bullet had torn through the flesh The Saint mumbled incoherent sentences but led the way to their shack where he sat down on a rock and held his head in his hands Duke tried to examine the Saint s injuries but the old man shoved him away mumbling a curse Duke squinted closely at him It was the first time he had ever heard the Saint curse You sure got hit hard pardner observed Duke I don t reckon yuh never swore because yuh didn t know how From the street came the sound of voices as though the crowd had separated and was searching scattered voices yelling instructions with one group closer than the rest Duke reloaded his pistol and shook the Saint s shoulder Get up Saint There s men comin and we don t know whether they re friends or not But the Saint mumbled thickly and shook his head Came a scraping noise at the doorway and Duke lifted his head to see Luck leaning inside Come out she panted excitedly They are coming to hang you both Hurry Duke yanked the Saint to his feet and shoved him out of the doorway The silhouetted figures of men were coming over the rim of the Alley toward them Follow me whispered Luck It s your only chance The Saint mumbled thickly and tried to protest but Duke hustled him along in the heavy shadow of the rock ledges while behind them came the clamor of voices like a pack of hounds casting for a scent Luck led them angling up the side of the hill over ledges where Duke had to fairly carry the Saint until they came out over the rim Below them shone the yellow lights of the street which seemed to be deserted now From down in Sunshine Alley came the faint voices of the searchers calling to each other voices that echoed strangely from that black cleft in the mountain Luck took them straight to her own home The Saint sat down on the door step and held his head in his hands while he began his incoherent mumble again Whose place is this asked Duke Mine panted Luck Bring him inside Your home Silver Sleed s place Yes Don t you see it s the only place where they won t search But suppose they do argued Duke What will they think of you Miss Luck They won t come here Help him inside please They will think you hid in the rocks tonight I know a trail that leads around Ruby Hill and you can go out that way into the desert Nobody will ever think of watching that trail I ll get your burro and the stuff from your shack Bring him in before some of them pass here They may search the hill tonight Duke helped the Saint to his feet and shoved him into the doorway Luck dropped the heavy blanket curtain over the front window and lit some candles while Duke guided the Saint to a chair The old man s hair and beard were a clotted mass of red and white now and his eyes blinked painfully in the candle light He tried to get to his feet but Duke put a hand on his shoulder The traps mumbled the Saint I m going to take up the traps Jim What does he mean whispered Luck Out of his head said Duke That bullet must have cracked his skull The Saint looked curiously at Duke Are you from St Pierre he asked He don t know you whispered Luck The Saint bowed his head for a moment and then looked back at Duke Did they find her he whispered hoarsely Did they Take it easy pardner soothed Duke I ll have to get yuh out of here ahead of a rope They ain t lookin for her they re lookin for us My father sent me home explained Luck I ran out of the street when the shooting began and he grabbed me He was very angry and made me come home The the men who got shot were friends of my father But I didn t come home then she continued after a moment s pause I heard them say they were going to hang you both We re sure obliged to yuh Miss Luck said Duke slowly We ll get out of here before they find yuh out Came a dull knock on the heavy door Duke drew his gun and stepped in closer to the wall snuffing out one of the candles I ll open it he whispered but Luck motioned him to stop Who is it she called Me Mica Cates answered a muffled voice You paw asked me to find out if yuh was home I m all right said Luck I ll tell him They ain t found them fellers yet Luck but they re still huntin Your dad is willin to pay big for the man what gets em Loper s dead Mendez and Fane are kinda bad but mebbe they ll live For a moment there was silence and then Cates said Member what I said about them buzzards It sure is hard to fool a buzzard G d night Luck turned to Duke her face white in the flickering light of the one candle My dad she said slowly is offering money for your lives Duke thought of the I O U in his pocket Forty six thousand dollars No wonder Silver Sleed was willing to pay well to stop collection on that piece of paper It would break Sleed to pay that bet strip him of his unearned wealth I reckon your dad s got the wrong idea of us said Duke slowly He did not want her to know why Silver Sleed wanted to kill him I ll get your burro and things she said and slipped out through the back entrance before he could stop her The Saint lifted his gory head and stared at her as she went past him He started to get up but sank back in his chair muttering softly wonderingly He looked at Duke closely without a sign of recognition in his eyes How do yuh feel Saint asked Duke How do I feel parroted the Saint Why do you ask me that Where am I Don t yuh remember Saint You re in Silver Sleed s home right now Sleed s home The Saint got slowly out of his chair and looked around as though an inspection of the four walls would corroborate his statement Sleed s home he repeated as though to himself and then to Duke I don t understand I can t Don t yuh remember the shootin in the street One of Sleed s men shot yuh Saint but he paid damn well for it One of Sleed s men What men do you mean It was not the voice of the old Saint Gone was the deep organ like tone and in its place was a harsh rasping enunciation toneless colorless You take it easy old timer advised Duke We ll get out of here first and talk afterwards The Saint heard this indifferently as his hand ran slowly through his great white beard now streaked and clotted with blood Across the room was a mirror in a rough frame and his eyes traveled to this He staggered over to it and peered at himself for several long moments He turned away and staggered against the wall where he stared at Duke wide eyed Who am I he breathed My God who am I His voice was almost a scream and his hands clutched against the rough wall There was no doubt in Duke s mind but that the Saint had gone insane from his wound Easy pardner soothed Duke You ll remember who yuh are Set down and take it easy Who am I whined the Saint paying no heed to Duke s advice Don t you know whom I am Le Saint answered Duke Yes that s my name Le Saint He stared at Duke for several moments shaking his head as though in pain or perplexity Then he said I don t know you but your face is familiar Who are you Duke Steele Yes nodded the Saint that is the name but I don t remember you very well You heard what happened to me didn t you The question was child like in its simplicity and the Saint smiled wistfully as he spoke What happened to you queried Duke I thought everyone knew The factor at Norway Lake told everyone I thought Where s Norway Lake The Saint smiled and shook his head I forgot that you were a stranger It is north of here I am a trapper a free trader they call me There were three of us on Moose River no four But there were only three of us went in there The baby was born that winter The fur was plentiful and our catch was large My wife The Saint stopped and stared at the floor as though unable to continue It was a hard life for a woman away from her own kind I trusted my partner The Saint s manner seemed to change and he cursed witheringly in a mixture of English French and another language which Duke had never heard It seemed to relieve him for he continued The fur was ready to take out in the spring and my partner was to make the voyage alone On the day he left I was going to take up a few traps which had not been lifted Somehow my wife seemed nervous and I questioned her She confessed that she was afraid of my partner I laughed My friend it seemed a huge joke The load of furs was launched and my partner waved adieu I watched him pole away and went to my wife laughing at her grave expression He is gone I said and anyway it is foolish of you to feel as you do about him Has he ever been anything except a good friend to us I do not know she replied as she hugged the baby and went into the cabin I laughed and went on the trail But a man s mind is the devil s garden where seeds of suspicion take root easily and I grew uneasy I would go back to the little cabin and stay with my wife until she was no longer afraid I reached the cabin just in time to see my partner who had returned forcing my wife into the canoe He had come back evidently with the intention of stealing my wife along with the furs I shouted at him as I ran down the shore and I saw him throw my baby bodily into the canoe with my wife who had fainted from her struggle And then he shoved off from the shore just as I reached there but not soon enough to escape The Saint drew his hand across his eyes as though striving to shut out that sight We fought he continued slowly fought like beasts and I whipped him but just before he went down under a powerful blow he managed to fall against the canoe and shove it into the current where the water gains speed for the white rapids below The Saint shook his head slowly I never found them never I forgot the man who was responsible for my loss and he escaped I have sworn to kill him my friend The Indians found the overturned canoe empty For God s sake breathed Duke as the Saint bowed his head over a loss sustained twenty years before It seemed utterly impossible yet true What was your partner s name asked Duke Martin replied the Saint evenly through clenched teeth Duke shook his head He knew no one by the name He knew little about the loss of memory but felt sure that the bullet which had scored the Saint s head had shocked him back twenty years and he shuddered as he wondered what must be the Saint s feeling when he realized that he had lost twenty years of his life From below the cabin came the hoarse yelling of a man like the leader of a wolf pack sounding a view hello to his comrades when he scents the trail anew Shouts answered him Suddenly the back door crashed open and Luck half fell inside panting painfully They know where you are she panted I got your burro and blankets but they found me and took them away Someone made a guess that you were at my house and my father struck him down for the suggestion but they are coming to find out I reckon we ll meet em here said Duke slowly and nodded toward the Saint He s gone crazy Luck As Luck looked toward the Saint he raised his head and looked straight at Duke as he said Who has gone crazy Duke It was the booming voice of the old Saint again He got to his feet and shook his head as though to clear his befogged memory They re cornerin us Saint said Duke and it kinda looks like the end of the trail Come out this way quick urged Luck starting for the rear door which opened on to a rocky slope leading on a steep grade up the side of Ruby Hill The Saint stumbled out of the door with Duke close behind him and they went up the hill winding their way around the tall spires dodging from shadow to shadow to escape the moonlight which lighted the world like a mighty blue tinted incandescent lamp Behind them came the voices of the mob the crashing of the front door of the cabin hollow muffled voices as those inside shouted the information that their quarry had escaped from the rear The tunnels panted Luck The hill is full of them They stopped for a breathing spell and watched the crowd below them climbing the hill their voices plainly audible in the thin atmosphere They re headin for the tunnels shouted Silver Sleed s voice We ll get em now Duke turned and followed Luck climbing higher and higher over the barren rocks while below them came the redoubled shouts of the crowd as they saw the flitting figures far up on the cliffs The Saint exclaimed Duke suddenly Where is he Luck panting against a rock looked back She and Duke were alone Breathlessly they scanned the world below them and watched the crowd coming black figures in that ghostly light All danger to themselves was forgotten What had become of the Saint He s crazy muttered Duke That bullet knocked him crazy but he s my pardner and I m going back Luck They kill you panted Luck My father But Duke Steele was going back down the hill calling softly the Saint s name and Luck followed him There was no sign of him in the path of the coming crowd so Duke and Luck swung wide peering into the shadows until they were almost past the mob which had not seen them return Gawd muttered Duke If we could find him now we could double back on them Suddenly the clamoring crowd went silent It was uncanny Duke led the way swiftly around the base of a broken ledge and they found themselves just at the rear of the halted mob a mob as silent as the dead Just beyond and above them stood the Saint a huge figure back lighted in the moonlight until it seemed that a halo encircled his great white head Silently like a prophet of old he reared his huge bulk in their path as though rebuking them for their evil actions Duke caught his breath It was so unreal weird Kill him grunted Silver Sleed s voice but the crowd did not move It was as though the Saint held a strange power over them Duke gripped his gun tightly and waited There was nothing he could do to help the Saint now Then slowly the Saint began his descent toward the crowd which parted to let him through Miners hardened gamblers killers the riff raff of the new West drew aside in wonderment or fear of this man Slowly he came among them peering into their faces as though seeking someone while they silently stared at him Blood muttered Mica Cates who was near Duke and the girl Blood and buzzards Suddenly the Saint stopped He was looking straight at Silver Sleed now and Silver Sleed s right hand held a cocked pistol at his hip tensed ready to fire Then the Saint spoke The trail ends here Sleed Martin It has been full of shadows and I have only a memory just a memory I want you whom men call Silver Sleed It may only be a nightmare Martin but it is real to me now As the Saint spoke he sprang like a tiger Silver Sleed fired but his bullet smashed into the cliff behind the Saint and before he could shoot again the Saint was upon him Both of them were giant men and they crashed together like two grizzlies while the crowd backed away to give them room knowing nothing of the reasons for the fight Luck had started ahead but Duke drew her back against the rock My God he s stronger than Sleed gasped a man Look at him will yuh The rest of the crowd watched silently the stranger battle Silver Sleed was battling for his life while the old Saint insane with the stored up hate of years and with the super human strength of a madman battered and crushed Silver Sleed without mercy The thudding of mighty blows the crash of clinches scraping of feet on the barren rock but no sound from the mob For all the movement about them they might as well have been fighting alone on the mountain top Suddenly they drew apart only to crash together again but this time Silver Sleed went down striking the back of his head against the rock The Saint stood over him hunched with arms bent like the wings of an eagle about to strike then his arms swept down around Silver Sleed and swung up with Sleed in his arms With a mighty heave he swung the unconscious man across his shoulder turned and lumbered away around the side of the cliffs Stop him screamed a man Stop him echoed the crowd suddenly realizing that they had voices After him they went but the chase was slow It was only a narrow trail which broke off to the sharp cliffs below it Beyond them went the Saint with the sure footedness of a mountain goat traveling at a pace that none dared imitate Duke and Luck followed closely Duke had forgotten that he was also being hunted by the crowd and it is doubtful if any of the crowd knew or cared about him now He s got to go into the Silver Shell tunnel yelled a man That s the end of the trail Beyond this tunnel was a wide crevice in the cliffs which extended back into the mountain It was impossible to go beyond the tunnel either up or down The Saint had trapped himself Stumbling along this trail came the crowd or as many as dared to trust this narrow pathway in the tricky moonlight until they reached the wide ledge which constituted the mouth of the Silver Shell He s bottled up cried a miner but it ain t goin to help Sleed none There s a cross cut tunnel into the Kalura panted a newcomer He ll find that Watch the mouth of the Kalura I tell yuh The crowd ran back along the trail until they could look up and beyond the crevice where the Kalura workings opened out onto a much higher ledge From this spot it was five hundred feet straight down into Sunshine Alley A man cocked his rifle and leaned back against the rocky wall but another jerked the gun away from him You fool Killin the old man won t save Sleed and you can t be sure in this light Suddenly two figures appeared on this ledge silhouetted against the moon Sleed had recovered from his injury and was fighting again They clashed together blending into one figure Then the Saint picked Sleed up in his arms balanced him for a second and hurled him far out over the abyss The man with the rifle dropped it and flung his hands to his eyes and a hoarse gasp went up from the crowd as Sleed s body faded out into the depths falling like a plummet The Saint was standing near the edge of the rock with his arms high above his head as he gazed into space Then his laughter came down to them the choking cackle of a maniac It was the first time that Duke Steele had ever heard the Saint laugh aloud Luck was leaning back against the rock her face as white as snow and with her eyes shut For a moment Duke thought she had fainted but her eyes opened and she stared back at the old Saint atop the ledge still cackling in his glee As he lowered his arms and turned as though to go back into the tunnel he slipped fell sidewise clawing at the rock which slid away with him For a moment he seemed to hang half off the cliff but the edge of the rock seemed to crumble away under his weight and he shot sidewise into space to join Silver Sleed Duke had started forward as though to try and help the Saint and when he turned back Luck was gone Silently the crowd filed past him wordless from the tragedy they had just seen forgetting that he was one of the men they had been hunting Duke gazed for a long time into the silvered depths of the Alley From far away came the eerie wailing cry of a desert coyote Duke shook his head Perhaps it was better for the Saint Memory had only half returned to him the balancing point which might mean insanity He had achieved his purpose after twenty years twenty years of another personality which urged him on to hunt down the man who had ruined his life Suddenly Duke realized that Luck was the daughter of the Saint She had been the lost baby Sleed was Sleed Martin the trapping partner of the Saint Twenty years another person muttered Duke My Gawd No wonder he looked in that glass and asked me who he was Duke turned and went slowly down the hill toward Sleed s cabin A gray burro crossed into the moonlight Duke s burro It was half packed and dragging a blanket The pack sacks were still intact half filled with food and a small keg of water was tied between the saddle posts Luck had made good as far as she was able Duke caught the animal and led it down the hill behind him He did not know where he was going now Near the corner of Sleed s home he stopped Someone was talking and Duke recognized Mica Cates s voice Duke edged in closer Luck was sitting on the rough steps with her head buried in her hands while Mica Cates and another man stood near her It shore was hard luck said Mica softly but I knowed somethin was due to happen But why sobbed Luck Why did that man do it Crazy grunted Mica He called him Martin My daddy s name was Sleed He wa n t responsible Luck said the other man He was jist plumb crazy thasall Don t yuh worry soothed Cates Calico ll take care of yuh Why yo re rich Luck Everythin yore dad had belongs to you You can git eddicated and have silk dresses and Mica Cates seemed to expand and you won t have t live in Calico What become of that other feller queried the other man I reckon we plum forgot him Sleed wanted him especially I wonder if he wasn t crazy too Luck looked up quickly Don t say that He he wasn t crazy Duke turned away and picked up the lead rope of his burro and went softly around the house and down past the lighted town which was strangely silent for Calico A few miles out on the desert he stopped and looked back at the lights of Calico which were now only a tiny flicker against the dead black of the hills Slowly he drew out a folded paper from his pocket and looked at the scrawl thereon I owe you forty six thousand dollars Silver Sleed Duke glanced back at Calico as he slowly tore the paper into bits and scattered them to the wind He picked up the lead rope and spoke softly to the burro One man wondered if I was crazy and she denied it Forty six thousand dollars I wonder which was right And he turned and went into the misty spaces of the desert alone Transcriber s note The Table of Contents at the beginning of the book was created by the transcriber Minor
