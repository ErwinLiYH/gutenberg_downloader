CHAPTER I PLAYING TRUANT I declare Frank it is time we were off It is almost nine o clock I wish to goodness there were no such things as school houses and school books in the world I am not going to school to day You re not No sir I m going to take French leave Do you mean that you are going to run away I suppose that is what you country fellows call it Well now you had better take a friend s advice and think twice before you do that You ll get yourself into trouble sure The rule of our school is that you must bring a written excuse every time you are absent That was the rule of our school in Boston too but it didn t keep the fellows from staying away whenever they felt like it Where did you get your excuses We wrote them ourselves and signed our father s name to them that s the way we got them You can t fool our teacher that way He knows our hand writing too well He knows yours too by this time I can disguise it so that he ll not recognize it I bet you Don t let s go Leon I am heartily sick of school and everything connected with it So am I Then suppose we spend the day in the woods The conversation above recorded took place one gloomy autumn morning between Leon Parker and his city cousin Frank Fuller They were about sixteen years of age and were bright honest looking boys but one of them at least was just the opposite of what he appeared to be Leon Parker lived in the little town of Eaton in one of our Northern States His father was a practising lawyer and the boy was given every opportunity to prepare himself for usefulness in after life But Leon was too indolent to study and the consequence was that he always stood at the foot of his class and saw boys younger than himself carry off the honors he might have won if he had been willing to work for them Leon was not such a boy as you would have chosen for a companion He was cross and overbearing and his father was often obliged to take him to task for some of his misdeeds This always made him very angry Other boys seemed to get on without having the least trouble with their parents or anybody else and Leon finally came to the conclusion that his father was a tyrant and that he would be much happier if he could go so far away from him that he would never see him again And yet there were a good many boys in Eaton who would have been glad to change places with him While his father insisted that he should behave himself he was at the same time very indulgent and he had supplied Leon with a good many things which the majority of the boys in Eaton regarded as necessary to their happiness He owned a beautiful little skiff a jointed bass rod and a light fowling piece He had ample opportunity to use them too The country about the village was hilly almost mountainous the woods and thickets were dense and grouse quails and gray and black squirrels could be bagged any day without the slightest trouble Foxes were more abundant than the neighboring farmers wished they were deer were shot within sight of the court house every winter and now and then a bear or wildcat was seen among the hills In summer the river which flowed in front of the village offered black and rock bass pike and perch In the fall it was visited by thousands of wild ducks which stopped there to rest during their migrations and some of them were so well satisfied with the feeding grounds they found there that they remained all winter The most of the boys in Eaton thought it was a nice place to live but Leon as we have said was very discontented and matters were made worse by the arrival of his cousin Frank Fuller who was sent to Eaton because he could not be managed at home It was understood among the boys to whom he had been introduced that he had come there for the purpose of attending the high school of which the village boasted and indeed his father s instructions were that he was not to miss a single day He had been there just two weeks and now he was talking of playing truant Mr Parker already regretted that he had consented to receive his nephew into his house He began to fear that his influence over Leon would be anything but beneficial He had already detected him in numberless falsehoods and had discovered that in spite of his apparent frankness he was as sneaking and sly as a boy could possibly be And Frank too was sorry that he had ever come to Eaton He was disgusted with the quiet life he led at his uncle s house and heartily wished himself back in Boston Let s go up on the hill and look at these snares you told me about the other day continued Frank We may find a partridge or two in them That s so exclaimed Leon I never should have thought of them again But it will be awful slow walking about the woods all day without our guns Oh we ll take them with us But how can we carry them downstairs and out of the house without being seen by somebody We ll do it you may depend upon that answered Frank as he disappeared in a closet opening off the room in which he and his cousin slept When he came out again he carried a light silver mounted rifle in one hand and a game bag and powder horn in the other We must have something to eat too It gives one a fearful appetite to climb over these hills You go and get the lunch just as if we were going to school and then come out to the barn and you will find me there with the guns To this Leon silently assented and went into the closet after his hunting accoutrements which he handed over to Frank While the latter was slinging the game bag and the powder and shot flasks over his shoulders Leon opened the door and ran downstairs In the hall he met his mother I was just coming to call you said she You boys will be late at school if you do not make haste Your lunch is all ready We re just going to start said Leon But not for school We have had quite enough of that he added to himself as he hurried through the hall and turned into the kitchen Cramming the lunch into his pocket he slipped out of the back door and ran toward the barn When Leon reached the barn he found Frank waiting for him He had watched his opportunity and as soon as his aunt went out of the hall he descended the stairs opened the front door and made his way around the house to the place of meeting Give me my game bag and I will put the lunch into it We are all right so far he said with a look of relief Oh there s nothing to be alarmed about answered Frank as he unslung the game bag from his shoulder and handed it to his cousin If you had been in such scrapes as often as I have you would think nothing of it Perhaps not but I almost wish I had gone to school said Leon honestly What will become of us when father finds out that we have played hookey That s what bothers me It needn t bother you for he s not going to find it out was Frank s encouraging reply We ll enjoy ourselves in the woods for a day or two and then we ll go back to our Latin and geometry again I ll write the excuse Don t spoil a good day s sport by worrying over that Having put the lunch in his game bag Leon slung it over his shoulder picked up his gun and opening a back door struck out across a wide field that lay between the barn and the nearest piece of woods closely followed by his cousin They walked rapidly looking back now and then to make sure that they were keeping the barn between themselves and the house and it was not until they had climbed the fence and plunged into the woods that Leon felt safe from discovery Then he drew a long breath of satisfaction and slackened his pace If I stood as much in fear of my father as you do of yours I wouldn t stay with him said Frank who seemed to be perfectly at his ease I d run away from him It was right on the point of Leon s tongue to tell his cousin that he had long ago resolved to do that very thing but he didn t say it for he was not sure that it would be quite safe to trust Frank with his secret I have often thought I should like to go out West and live as those hunters and trappers do continued Frank Wouldn t it be jolly to have a snug cabin somewhere in the mountains and nothing to do but attend to your traps every day and hunt the big game that is so abundant out there This very thought had often suggested itself to Leon s lively imagination and he had made up his mind that some day he would live in just that way I shall see that country before long Frank went on Father is going to California on business next year and he has promised that if I will behave myself while I am here in Eaton he will take me with him If I like the looks of things as well as I think I shall you ll never see me among civilized people again Will you stay out there and become a hunter asked Leon Yes sir But what would you say to your father I shouldn t say anything to him When I found a place that suited me I would slip away from him and let him come home without me But you have lived in the city all your life and what do you know about the Western country I could learn all about it couldn t I I am a pretty good shot with a rifle and I should try to work myself in somewhere as post hunter Others have done it and I don t see why I couldn t What is a post hunter asked Leon Why he is a man whose business it is to keep the garrison supplied with fresh meat If the soldiers go out on an expedition to explore the country or hunt Indians he goes with them and shoots all the game they want to eat He is regularly employed and paid by the government If I couldn t get a position like that I d hunt buffaloes for their hides Why only the other day I read in the paper that one old hunter out there had killed twelve hundred buffaloes in a single season He sold their skins for a dollar apiece too Twelve hundred dollars a year exclaimed Leon Oh some of them make more than that And then just think of the fun they have Leon had often thought of that very thing and he had thought of it in school when his mind ought to have been fully occupied with his books Nothing suited him better than to ramble all day over the hills with his double barrel in his hands making double shots at the game birds with which the woods abounded He generally spent every Saturday during the hunting season in this way and he had finally come to believe that he would rather do that than anything else The only drawback to his enjoyment was that when the day drew to a close the hunt came to an end and he was obliged to go home That was a place where he never saw any pleasure especially in the evening His father was always deeply engrossed with his paper his mother was busy with her needle and until Frank came Leon had no one to whom he could safely confide his secret hopes and longings When he became a hunter with a nice little cabin of his own in some secluded valley where game of all kinds was abundant things would be very different he often told himself After he had spent the day in attending to his traps and fighting with the grizzlies he would return to his snug harbor well loaded with the spoils of the chase and while his venison steaks and corn bread were turning to a crisp brown under the influence of a cheerful fire he would recline at his ease upon a pile of soft buffalo robes and think over the events of the day while he listened to the howling of the wolves and the sifting of the snow upon the roof of his cabin Leon always grew excited when this agreeable picture arose before his mental vision and he longed for the day when the dream would become a reality Frank as may be supposed had a good deal to say about the joys of a hunter s life and while he talked and Leon listened they pushed their way rapidly through the woods and finally after crossing several deep ravines and climbing two or three fences they found themselves on Mr Parker s hill farm where Leon had set his snares The latter led the way toward the thicket in which the snares had been placed and when he reached it he stopped suddenly dropped the butt of his gun to the ground and uttered an exclamation indicative of great rage and astonishment What s the matter asked Frank Why just look at that and tell me if you ever heard of a more contemptible trick exclaimed Leon Frank looked but could discover nothing to excite his cousin s anger All he saw was a low fence built of twigs which stretched away on each side of him as far as his eyes could reach At intervals of a dozen feet or more were little openings about six inches wide and it was in these openings that the snares had been set The last time Leon was there the snares were all in perfect order and ready to catch any luckless grouse or hare which might attempt to pass through the openings before spoken of But now there was not a single snare to be seen The strings of which they were made had all been removed It s the meanest piece of business I ever heard of continued Leon backing toward a fallen log and seating himself upon it That meddlesome Oscar Preston has been up here and destroyed all my work I wish I could get within reach of him for about two minutes I d teach him to mind his own business Leon struck his open palm with his clenched hand and looked very savage indeed CHAPTER II THE BUSHWHACKERS Who is Oscar Preston asked Frank as he seated himself on the log beside his cousin Oh he s the village pot hunter Leon answered throwing as much contempt into his tones as he could Pot hunter repeated Frank Yes He s a market shooter He doesn t hunt game for the fun of it as you and I and all other decent fellows do but he does it to make money out of it He is too lazy to earn a living in any respectable way and besides as he comes of a dishonest family no one in town will employ him You see he and his brother used to work in Smith Anderson s grocery store Oscar was one of the clerks and his brother was book keeper and cashier Just before you came here his brother disappeared all of a sudden and has never been heard of since After he was gone his books were examined and it was found that he was a defaulter to the amount of three thousand dollars Smith Anderson didn t like that very well and believing that if there was one thief in the Preston family there might be another they thought it was best to give Oscar his walking papers Does he make any money by shooting for the market asked Frank I should say he did There is a mortgage of five hundred dollars on his mother s place his father is dead you know and Oscar has paid off a hundred dollars of it since he left the store He s got a leaky old scow a double barrel blunderbuss that you and I wouldn t pick up in the street and a half starved hound The scow he uses for hunting ducks on the river and with the hound he runs foxes and rabbits When summer comes I suppose he will fish all the time He can catch black bass where nobody else would ever think of looking for them and he can sell every one of them for ten cents a pound But what right had he to destroy your snares He had no right to do it for he is not game constable What sort of a constable is that asked Frank Why you know there is a law in this State which says that game shall not be shot except at certain seasons of the year and a game constable is a man whose business it is to see that the law is obeyed It is against the law to trap partridges and quails and if we had a game constable in town I shouldn t have set these snares for I should have rendered myself liable to prosecution but the office is vacant now for there was no one elected to fill it last year I think Oscar was taking a good deal upon himself said Frank So do I and the reason he did it was because every partridge or rabbit that I catch leaves just one less for him to shoot for market But these are my father s grounds and I shall give him to understand the first time I meet him that I want him to keep away from here You and I can shoot all the birds there are in these woods I wouldn t take the trouble to say a word to him replied Frank I d pay him back in his own coin If he wouldn t let me snare birds I wouldn t let him hunt foxes Do you ever see that hound of his running about the woods Oh yes I often see him Well the next time you put eyes on him just bushwhack him and send a charge of shot into him I can do that can t I exclaimed Leon growing excited at once But what if Oscar should find it out he added after he had taken a second thought Very likely he will find it out He will know that somebody has shot his hound when he finds him dead won t he But I mean suppose he should find out that I did it I don t see how he can do it The hound if he is following a trail will probably be some distance in advance of his master and all you ve got to do is to knock him over and dig out It isn t at all probable that Oscar will ever find out who did the shooting but if he does you can tell him that you did it to square accounts with him for destroying your snares I d like to do it but it would be sure to raise a storm in the village said Leon shaking his head in a very significant manner All the folks used to like that boy and he s got a good many friends yet Then show me the hound and I ll shoot him said Frank impatiently I thought you had more pluck I am not afraid of that fellow or his friends either Now let s set these snares again and go on and see if we can find some birds But in the first place explain one thing to me What did you build that fence for To stop any rabbit or partridge who might come this way answered Leon I shouldn t think it would stop them They could easily jump over it for it isn t much more than a foot high But they won t do it said Leon Whenever they come to an obstruction of this kind they never attempt to cross it that is they are not alarmed but run along by the side of it to find some way to get through or around it When they reach one of these openings they try to squeeze through it and that is the time they get caught Now I ll show you how the snares are set Leon placed his gun against the log on which he was sitting and producing a piece of fine strong twine from one of the pockets of his game bag he made a running noose in one end of it The other he fastened securely to a small hickory sapling which grew near one of the openings in the fence This done he bent the sapling over and placed the noose in the opening and confined it there with a short notched stick which he cut from a neighboring bush Then in order to show his cousin how the snare operated he pushed the notched stick out of its place by giving it a gentle tap with his finger whereupon the sapling straightened itself up with a jerk and the running noose was fastened firmly about his wrist Oh I see exclaimed Frank When a bird or rabbit tries to pass through one of these little gates he knocks out the stick and is pulled up by the neck before he knows what is the matter with him That is just the way the thing works replied Leon and the noose is drawn together so quickly when the sapling flies back to its place that nothing can get out of the way of it Nine times in ten when you find one of your snares sprung you will find game in it Give me some of that string and I ll help you set them said Frank leaning his rifle against the log beside his cousin s double barrel I know how it is done now The boys had a good hour s work before them The fence was nearly a hundred yards long there were a good many openings in it and the person who destroyed the snares whoever he was had made sure work of it He had not only carried off all the strings and thrown away the notched sticks but in some places he had broken down the saplings to which the strings were tied Leon had a good many hard things to say about Oscar while he was engaged in repairing damages and when he found how completely all his care and patient labor had been undone by the despised market shooter he grew angrier than ever All the foxes he catches with that hound this winter he can carry in one of his vest pockets declared Leon as he trimmed the branches off a sapling with his knife The very first time I get within range of him I ll fill him so full of holes that he will answer for a window I don t care if Oscar sees me when I do it either At length the repairs were all completed and the snares were set in readiness to snatch up anything in the way of small game that might chance to come within their reach The work had given Frank an appetite and he proposed that they should go further back in the woods shoot a couple of squirrels if they could not find any birds roast them over a fire and eat them with their lunch His cousin readily falling in with the idea they shouldered their guns and before setting out turned to take a survey of their work and make sure that nothing had been left undone At that moment the bugle like notes of a hound rang through the woods There he is now exclaimed Leon in great excitement Isn t it lucky Keep perfectly quiet until we find out which way he is going Are you sure that is the dog you want to see asked Frank Of course I am There s not another hound about the village If he comes in sight of us you will see that he is a large tan colored animal with ears like an elephant s Everybody says he is just splendid He has brought his owner many a dollar to go toward paying off that mortgage but I ll bet he ll not bring him many more if I get a fair chance at him Again the deep toned bay rang out on the frosty air awakening a thousand echoes among the hills and this time it sounded nearer than before The hound had evidently struck a warm trail and Leon told his cousin in a suppressed whisper that the trail led directly toward them A few seconds and even the inexperienced Frank became satisfied of this fact The hound now gave tongue almost continuously the melodious notes grew louder every moment and presently a rustling in the bushes told the boys that he was close at hand and coming nearer with every bound Leon cocked one barrel of his gun planted his feet firmly upon the ground and just then a hound which answered to the description he had given to his cousin except in one particular emerged from the thicket He ran along with his nose close to the ground wagging his tail vigorously and so intent was he upon his work that he did not immediately discover the boys When he did become aware of their presence however he merely lifted his head long enough to give one look at them and then took up his trail again He was not at all afraid of them Bugle that was the name of the hound knew everybody in the village and everybody knew him and liked him too That is the last trail you will ever follow my four footed friend Leon exclaimed as he raised his gun to his shoulder and waited for the animal to come out from behind a fallen log which just at that moment concealed him from view Mind what you are doing Frank whispered laying his hand upon his cousin s arm That isn t the dog you want Yes it is was Leon s reply Why you said Oscar s hound was half starved and this one is as plump as a quail protested Frank I guess I know what I am about answered Leon impatiently He shook off his cousin s hand drew his gun closer to his face and just then the hound came in sight around the end of the log Leon took a quick aim at his head and pulled the trigger There was a commotion among the leaves a howl of anguish and when the smoke cleared away the boys saw Bugle running at full speed through the woods yelping loudly at every jump He was out of sight in an instant There exclaimed Leon Go and hunt up your master and tell him to keep his hands off my snares in future Let s dig out said Frank hastily Oscar can t be far away and you don t want him to find you here No Leon had not the slightest desire to meet Bugle s master after what he had done He had talked very glibly about teaching Oscar to mind his own business if he could only get within reach of him for a few minutes but he knew very well that that was something he could not do Oscar was a young athlete even if he was nothing but a market shooter Although he was a few months younger than Leon he was a good deal larger and stronger and it would have been no trouble at all for him to take Leon by the collar with one hand and Frank with the other and give them both a hearty shaking Probably Leon was afraid he would do it if he caught them for he lost no time in acting upon his cousin s suggestion to dig out He ran so swiftly that he very soon left Frank behind and the latter who was quickly out of breath begged him to hold up What makes you take to this rough ground panted Frank as he toiled up a high hill which his cousin had climbed in his rapid flight Because the woods are thicker up here and afford us better hiding places was Leon s answer Well there s no need that we should run ourselves to death said Frank as he seated himself on a huge bowlder and drew his handkerchief across his forehead and I ll not go another step There s no need of it for we are safe now It is lucky there is no snow on the ground for if there was Oscar could follow us all day We ll have a few minutes rest and then we ll see if we can shoot something for our dinner Leon took his seat upon another bowlder a short distance away and during the ten minutes he remained there he never said a word to his cousin The latter did not speak to him either Frank had no breath to waste in words and Leon was busy with his own thoughts He was by no means proud of the act he had just performed He was a bad boy but he was not wholly depraved and his conscience smote him when he reflected that he had in a moment of anger deprived an industrious hard working youth of almost the only means he had of earning a livelihood and keeping a roof over the head of his widowed mother He knew very well that the ambitious and high spirited Oscar was not a market shooter from choice He followed the business for the same reason that a good many others follow a business they do not like because he could find nothing else to do and he was not the one to stand idly by and see his mother suffer for the want of the necessaries of life Father says he deserves a good deal of credit and that there isn t one boy in a thousand who would do as well as he has done thought Leon and then he grew angry again What do I care for what father says he added mentally He is always ready to praise other boys while for me he has nothing but scowls and cross words I am glad I killed that old hound and I am only sorry that Oscar hadn t got a dozen so that I could shoot them all He needn t think he owns all the birds in the country simply because he makes a living by shooting them for market Are you rested now Frank If you are we ll go on The young hunters did not have far to look to find the dinner of which they were in search The squirrels were busy gathering their winter s supply of nuts and on almost the first hickory tree they saw they found three plump little fellows and bagged them all two falling to Leon s double barrel and the other coming down with one of Frank s bullets through his head As soon as they had secured their game Leon led the way to the bottom of the deep ravine where they found a stream of water beside which they built their fire The squirrels were roasted on forked sticks over the flames and when the bones had all been picked clean and the last morsel of the lunch had disappeared the truants stretched themselves at full length beside the fire and listened to the howling of the wind which shook the leafless branches of the trees on the summit of the hills above them and watched the little flakes of snow that now and then found their way into the ravine The snow storm that all the weather wise people in the village had been predicting for several days past was now raging above their heads but it did not reach them in their sheltered camp for the thick screen of evergreens which lined the foot of the high hills on both sides of the stream effectually protected them from its fury It is of no use to think of hunting as long as it snows and blows like this said Leon so we may as well stay here I was just thinking of something said Frank Suppose we had found your snares all in order and a partridge or rabbit in each one of them What would we have done with the game It wouldn t have been safe to take it home with us Of course it wouldn t answered Leon We should have exposed ourselves at once What could we have done with it I never thought of that before but there s one thing I have been thinking about all day What are we going to say to father when we go home to night We ll not say anything to him We ll hide our guns in the barn and walk into the house as we do every night when we come from school I wish I needn t go home at all said Leon spitefully I could have enjoyed myself to day if I hadn t been continually haunted by the fear that something is going to happen I declare it is growing dark already What time is it Three o clock replied Frank consulting his watch Is it as late as that cried Leon jumping to his feet Where has the day gone We mustn t stay here a minute longer We have four miles to go and if we are not at home within fifteen minutes after school is dismissed we shall hear of it I tell you Leon noticed that Frank did not appear to be quite so indifferent to the consequences of playing truant as he did when they started out in the morning He sprang to his feet with all haste and after throwing his game bag and powder horn over his shoulder assisted his cousin to put out the fire When this had been done the two boys clambered up the hill and struck out at a rapid walk for the village where a great surprise awaited them CHAPTER III OSCAR AND HIS TROUBLES Preston as soon as you get those goods tied up Mr Smith wants to see you in the office The speaker was Mr Anderson junior partner of the firm of Smith Anderson the leading grocery and dry goods merchants of Eaton and the person addressed was one of the clerks who was engaged in putting up some groceries that had just been ordered by a customer He was a sturdy handsome boy of sixteen years of age and until within a few days had been one of the most cheerful light hearted fellows about the store but he had changed wonderfully of late and the expression of melancholy his face always wore deepened as the junior partner leaned over the counter and whispered these words into his ear Very good sir he replied It has come at last he added to himself as the junior partner walked away I can t say I am surprised for I have been expecting it It is all up with me now I don t care for myself but what will become of mother The clerk s hands trembled as he went on tying up the groceries and when the last article the order book called for had been weighed out and all the bundles had been placed on one end of the counter and marked with the owner s name so that the man who drove the delivery wagon would know where to take them he called all his courage to his aid and walked into the office the door of which was open As he entered a gray headed hard featured man who was sitting on a high stool in front of the desk turned and looked at him over his spectacles Mr Anderson says you want to see me sir said the clerk Yes I sent for you replied the gray headed man There is the money we owe you fifteen dollars We shall not need your services any longer Am I discharged sir asked the boy as he took the bills that were handed him Yes Times are hard and trade dull as you know and we must begin to cut down our expenses You are the youngest clerk in the store and so you must go first May I ask you for a letter of recommendation to assist me in obtaining another situation asked the clerk I am sorry you ask me for it Oscar for I can t consistently give it to you replied Mr Smith The boy seemed to be utterly confounded His face grew pale and red by turns and as soon as he could speak he said with more spirit than his employer had ever seen him exhibit before Then you may as well acknowledge that your plan of cutting down expenses is merely a subterfuge I know why I am dismissed and I think you ought not to hold me responsible for my brother s rascality nor punish me for it I regret it more than you possibly can but I am in no way to blame for it We ll not argue the matter answered Mr Smith turning to his desk and picking up his pen All I have to say to you is that we do not need you any longer And all I have to say to you sir is good day returned the clerk He took his cap from the rack behind the door walked out of the store like one in a dream and turned down the street He went on by the hotel crossed the long bridge that spanned the creek and hurried along the road as if he were trying to leave behind him all recollection of the scene through which he had just passed I can t go home yet he kept saying to himself I haven t the heart to tell mother that I have lost my situation for she has had so much trouble already that it is a wonder how she bears up under it as well as she does For two hours Oscar tore along the road as if he were walking a match against time but fast as he went his gloomy thoughts kept pace with him The wind came down keen and strong from the hills stripping the withered leaves in showers from the shade trees on either side of the road and causing the boy s hands and face to turn to a deep purple but he never knew it He was so completely wrapped up in his troubles that he did not see any of the teams that passed him nor did he hear a single one of the invitations to ride that were shouted at him by the kind hearted farmers He could think of nothing but Mr Smith s refusal to assist him in obtaining another situation and he was only brought to his senses at last by the measured strokes of the town clock which came faintly to his ears followed almost immediately by the shrill whistle of the lock shop Then the boy stopped and looked about him He was standing on the summit of one of the highest hills and the village of Eaton could be dimly seen in the distance It s twelve o clock said he to himself I had no idea it was so late Now I ll go home I must go some time and I might as well go now as an hour later Besides mother will be uneasy if I am not there in time for dinner Let s look this matter squarely in the face and see what is to be done about it Oscar had just found out that he was completely chilled through He buttoned his coat pulled his collar up around his ears thrust his hands deep into his pockets and set out to retrace his steps to the village Oscar Preston could remember the day when he was as popular among the boys of his native town as his father during his life time had been among them Mr Preston had been a contractor and builder and was at one time thought to be well off in the world He owned the house in which he lived and had a small balance at the banker s but one day he fell off the very church whose bell had just aroused Oscar from his reverie receiving injuries which confined him to his bed for more than a year and finally resulted in his death During his long illness his savings rapidly dwindled away and at last he found it necessary to mortgage his home in order to obtain money to support his family and pay his heavy doctors bills At the time this happened Oscar was a student at the high school and his older brother Tom was cashier and book keeper in Smith Anderson s store His salary was small but still he might have saved something to assist his father in his extremity if he had been so inclined Tom however was wholly devoted to himself and cared for nothing but his own pleasure He thought more of horses and good clothes than he did of anything else and his money as fast as he earned it went into the pockets of the tailor and the proprietor of the livery stable Oscar was the only one who could be depended on and he was prompt to do what he could He left school and through the influence of friends obtained a situation as clerk in the same store in which his brother was employed He worked faithfully and every dollar of the pittance he earned was placed in his mother s hands he never spent a cent of it for himself Mr Preston s death was a severe blow to Oscar s mother but she had another hard trial in store for her In less than six months after he died Tom suddenly disappeared taking with him three thousand dollars that did not belong to him He had now been gone two weeks and his employers had just completed the work of examining his accounts During these two weeks a great change had taken place in Oscar He noticed that a good many of the village people who had had a smile or a nod for him in happier days never noticed him now One or two of the clerks in the store would hardly speak to him and at last his employers had discharged him because they were unwilling to allow any of their money to pass through his hands This was the worst part of the whole miserable business Oscar had never told his mother how he was shunned by some of his former friends for she had trouble enough of her own to bear but this was something he could not keep from her Mr Smith has been down on me ever since Tom ran away said Oscar to himself after he had thought the matter over I have seen it plainly enough and if I could only step into another situation somewhere I should be glad to leave him But when I ask a man for work and he wants to know why I was discharged what shall I say That s what hurts me Here you are Oscar exclaimed a cheery voice breaking in upon his meditations It is easier riding than walking Jump in An elegant top buggy drawn by a stylish high stepping horse dashed up beside the boy and the gentleman who was driving drew his reins with one hand while with the other he threw back the heavy lap robe so that the boy could get in It was Mr Parker Leon s father I am obliged to you but I believe I would rather walk was Oscar s reply But I am not going to let you walk said the gentleman almost sternly Jump in here Oscar was forced to smile in spite of himself but it was a sickly smile that did not fail to attract the lawyer s attention Now then he continued after the boy had seated himself by his side and tucked the lap robe about him what brought you so far into the country this cold day without your overcoat and what is the matter with you You look as though you had lost your best friend And so I have Mr Parker replied Oscar sadly Mr Smith gave me my walking papers this morning He did exclaimed the lawyer opening his eyes What reason did he give He says he is going to reduce expenses because times are so hard answered Oscar But I know that there is something back of that for he wouldn t give me a letter of recommendation He wouldn t No sir he wouldn t I asked him for one and he said he couldn t give it to me He has looked crossways at me ever since Tom has been gone He thinks that because my brother abused the confidence the firm placed in him I may abuse it too Whew whistled the lawyer My discharge could not have come at a worse time said Oscar I shall have to make a payment on that mortgage before long and how am I going to do it now that I am thrown out of employment If there were a dozen storekeepers in town who wanted a clerk they would not hire me under the circumstances Mr Parker fastened his eyes upon the little gilt ball on the top of one of the church spires in the distance and made no reply I have been told more than once that old Simpson is a sharper and that I had better look out for him continued Oscar He is always ready to lend money on mortgages to people who he thinks will never be able to repay it and as soon as it becomes due he forecloses and sells them out of house and home He owns a dozen farms about the village and he has got them all in that way When father died he told two or three men in town that he would own our house some day It is worth four thousand dollars with the lot on which it stands and the mortgage is only five hundred The lawyer kept his gaze directed toward the distant spire and said not a word until he drove into the village and reached the street in which Oscar lived Then he drew up beside the curbstone and as the boy was about to get out of the carriage he laid his hand upon his shoulder and said impressively Remember this Oscar Heaven always helps those who help themselves Don t give up Oh I ll never give up was the quick reply There must be something in this town for me to do and if there is I ll find it before I sleep soundly I hope you will believe me Mr Parker when I assure you that I have not done one single thing since I have been in that store that I am unwilling my mother should know I do believe you Oscar said the lawyer encouragingly I have all faith in you Mr Smith may find out one of these days that he has made a great mistake Keep up a good heart and you will come out all right in the end The accents of kindness touched the boy s heart His eyes filled with tears and without stopping to thank the lawyer for his words of cheer he turned about and hurried toward home while Mr Parker reined his horse away from the curbstone and drove on down the street He stopped in front of Smith Anderson s store and made his way into the office where he found the senior partner seated on his high stool busy with his books The two men exchanged greetings made a few remarks concerning the weather and then Mr Parker told the grocer why he had come there I understand that you paid Oscar Preston off this morning said he Now I am somewhat interested in that boy for it was through my influence that he obtained a place in your store and I d like to know what is the matter with him What is he guilty of We haven t been able to fasten any guilt upon him answered Mr Smith We only suspect him Of what asked the visitor Now see here Mr Parker exclaimed the grocer suppose you had a clerk working for you for twenty dollars a month out of which he was obliged to support his mother and pay taxes on a property worth four or five thousand dollars and that clerk should come to your office every day dressed in better clothes than you wear and looking as though he had just come out of some lady s band box what would you think Oho cried the lawyer Because Oscar takes pains to keep himself as neat as a new pin you suspect him of till tapping do you I can set your fears on that score at rest In the first place his mother makes all his clothes and the boy has no tailor s bills to pay In the next place I have known him to make more money in a single week in a little work shop he s got at home than you paid him for a month s services He is the most expert taxidermist I ever saw I have a case of birds in my house now for which I paid him forty dollars If he is making money as fast as that why can t he keep his hands out of my drawer demanded the grocer Do you mean to tell me that he has been stealing exclaimed Mr Parker I mean to tell you that somebody has been stealing was the reply Perhaps it was Tom A young man who will make false entries in his books would not be above taking money out of the drawer No it wasn t Tom We have missed money since he went away I don t see how you can look into Oscar s face and think him dishonest said Mr Parker who was very much surprised I would suspect any of your clerks before I would suspect him Well I wouldn t They have all been with me for a number of years and I have never seen anything wrong with them I watch my clerks pretty closely too Then I don t suppose it would be of any use for me to ask you to take Oscar back said the lawyer as he rose and drew on his gloves It would be of no use whatever was the prompt and decided reply I can t trust him and I don t want him to touch any more of my money I am certain that some of it has stuck to his fingers That settles the matter But mark my words You will one day discover that you have done that boy very great injustice Good day sir If I do I shall make him all the reparation in my power said the grocer Good day Mr Parker The lawyer was disappointed but he was not discouraged He did not get into his carriage again immediately but walked the whole length of the business portion of the street entering several stores and calling upon some of his professional friends He had a good word to say for the discharged clerk wherever he stopped and the result was made apparent that very afternoon Meanwhile Oscar all unconscious of the efforts that were being put forth in his behalf was making all haste to reach home It was long past the dinner hour and he knew that his mother would wonder at his absence She opened the door for him as he stepped upon the porch and although he tried to smile and look as cheerful and happy as usual she saw in a moment that there was something the matter with him CHAPTER IV THE YOUNG TAXIDERMIST What is it Oscar said Mrs Preston while an expression of anxiety settled on her pale face Oscar what has happened Nothing much mother replied the boy I am discharged That s all Is dinner ready O Oscar exclaimed his mother It s a fact Mr Smith wants to bring down his expenses and as I was the youngest clerk of course I had to go He said nothing about the grocer s refusal to give him the letter of recommendation for which he had applied That was his own trouble and he would not burden his mother with it Don t look so sober We have funds enough in the bank to support us for a few months and there are fifteen dollars more he added handing out the money he had received from Mr Smith But you know we were saving that to make the first payment on the mortgage said Mrs Preston anxiously Yes I know and perhaps we will use it for that purpose yet I shall start out as soon as I get something to eat and hunt up a situation Is dinner ready I have brought home a good appetite And Oscar thought he had But when he found himself seated at the table in the cosey little dining room with a substantial and well cooked dinner before him he discovered that he did not want anything to eat He forced down a few mouthfuls then put on his overcoat kissed his mother good by and went out But where should he go That was the question There were but three grocery stores in town and he knew that they were supplied with all the clerks they needed If the truth must be told he did not expect to obtain another situation But it would never do he told himself to give up without making an effort and besides he felt much better while he was stirring about in the open air than he would have felt if he had remained at home and mourned over his hard luck When he reached Main Street he could not muster up courage enough to enter a single one of the stores at which he had determined to apply for work Who would hire a boy that had been refused a letter of recommendation by his last employer While he was turning this question over in his mind someone called out Hallo there You re just the boy I want to see Come in here Oscar turned and found that he had been hailed by Mr Jackson the village druggist a fat jolly man who seemed to carry an atmosphere of cheerfulness with him wherever he went He gave the boy s hand a tremendous grip and shake after which he led him through the store into the office pushed him into a chair and seated himself in another Well Oscar said he I haven t seen you for a long time How does the world use you The world uses me well enough replied Oscar but some of the people in it might treat me a little better if they were so inclined Yes there are a good many people about us who seem to be of no earthly use here except to get themselves and others into trouble said the druggist and when we meet any of them the best thing we can do is to attend to our own business and pay no attention to them But what shall a fellow do when he has no business of his own to attend to asked Oscar Mr Jackson laughed so loudly and heartily that the boy was obliged to laugh too I know what you mean by that said the former I heard this morning that Mr Smith had discharged you and if I were in your place I should be glad of it I guess he didn t pay you much No sir but the little he did pay me was very acceptable In fact I don t see how I can get on without it I must find another situation to day if it is a possible thing Well you might as well give up the idea for it isn t possible answered the druggist I ll warrant that Smith has had half a dozen applications for your place already Now while you are waiting for something to turn up why can t you do a little job of work for me I want a case of birds to put in my dining room something like the one you sold Parker only different you know that is different birds and different groupings if that s the way to express it Oscar straightened up in his chair at once It was astonishing what a change these few words made in his feelings I believe Parker paid you forty dollars for that case of his didn t he continued the druggist Well I m willing to pay the same price for one equally as good How long will it take you to put it up for me About a week I have all the birds I need they are a fine lot too if I do say it myself but I must make the case you know All right Go to work as soon as you please When it is finished take it to my house Mrs Jackson will show you where to put it and come here for your money Remember now that I want nothing but game birds I don t care for snow birds and canaries like those you put in Parker s case They were not canaries said Oscar who could hardly help smiling at the jolly man s ignorance of natural history They were gold finches the little fellows you sometimes see picking the seeds out of thistles Oh said Mr Jackson Well I don t want any of em I want nothing but game birds I am sorry to say that I can t fill the order that way replied Oscar The bottom of the case won t hold all the birds I intend to give you You needn t put them all on the bottom Stand them up in a tree the way you did Parker s The wood cock snipe and plover are small birds and they could go up there as well as not It was now Oscar s turn to laugh I can put a grouse in the tree said he but who ever heard of a snipe or wood cock in such a situation Those birds are not perchers or climbers they are waders and live wholly on the ground Oh ah said Mr Jackson settling back in his chair with an air which said that Oscar had not made matters much clearer to him by his explanation But I ll tell you what s a fact he added straightening up again as a bright idea struck him I know I have seen quails in trees So have I but it was only when they were pursued by some animal such as a dog or fox If I should put any quails in your tree I d have to account for their presence there by putting a fox on the bottom of the case and he would take up too much room Well Oscar said the druggist after thinking a moment I guess you understand your business better than I do Fix up the case to suit yourself and I shall be satisfied Just then the front door opened and a couple of ladies came in Mr Jackson hurried out to wait upon them while Oscar who was in a great hurry to earn those forty dollars buttoned his overcoat and left the store His face was fairly radiant with joy and so completely was he wrapped up in his own thoughts that he did not see the gentleman who after trying in vain to avoid a collision with him finally seized him by the arm and held him fast Why Oscar I thought it was you exclaimed the gentleman How do you do By the way he added without giving the boy a chance to reply have you any more of those horned owls that you stuffed last winter No sir they are all sold answered Oscar What did you get apiece for them Three dollars Well now I want one of them to put into a little niche at the head of my stairway continued the gentleman If you will shoot one for me and mount it I ll give you three dollars for it I am afraid I can t do it Mr Shaw They are very scarce and those I shot last winter I found by accident Then get up a little earlier in the morning and hunt a little later at night and I ll give you five dollars If you succeed bring the bird around and your money is ready I ll do my best Now I ll just tell you what s the truth said Oscar to himself as he pulled his collar up around his ears and once more turned his face toward home I ve got some friends yet I can make the first payment on that mortgage interest and all and have a little money left to keep us in fuel and provisions until I can earn more Two orders in one day They came in just at the right time too I haven t had a chance to sell a bird before for six months Oscar did not know that the orders he had just received had been obtained for him that morning through the influence of Mr Parker If he had known it he would have lost no time in hunting up his benefactor and thanking him for the interest he took in his welfare But attributing his unexpected stroke of fortune to his good luck which he believed had not yet wholly deserted him he walked homeward with a light heart and the smile he carried into his mother s presence was instantly reflected from her own face Yes I have found work said he in reply to her inquiring look I ve a chance to make as much money in a week as I could have made in the store in two months Mr Jackson wants a case of birds something like the one I sold Mr Parker and Mr Shaw wants a horned owl I am not certain that I shall be able to fill the last order for an owl is a bird you can t find every day but I shall do my best for a five dollar bill is worth trying for Oscar ran upstairs to his room and when he came down again he was dressed for work Taking a bunch of keys from a nail in the kitchen he hurried through the wood shed and paused in front of the door leading into his workshop As he inserted one of the keys into the lock a loud bay of welcome arose from the inside and when he opened the door Bugle the finest fox hound that had ever been seen about Eaton crawled out from his warm bed under the work bench and after lazily stretching himself jumped up and placed his forepaws on his master s shoulders Bugle was a well trained hunting dog and so fond was he of following his favorite game that his master was obliged to lock him up in the shop every morning The hound would stay about the house in perfect contentment so long as Oscar was there but when the latter went to school or to the store Bugle would soon grow lonely and then he would hunt the town over to find someone with a gun on his shoulder If he succeeded in his object he would stick close to that man s side and if the man went to the woods Bugle would go also and run foxes for him with as much zeal and perseverance as he exhibited in working for his master If he could not find anyone who was going hunting he would start out alone and sometimes he would be gone two or three days He could not hunt foxes to any advantage by himself for there was need for someone to stand on the runways and shoot the game as it passed but sometimes he succeeded in digging a hare out of a rotten log in which it had taken refuge and he always brought the game home to show that his day s work had not been thrown away Oscar did not like this roving disposition on the part of his favorite and as two or three attempts had been made to steal the hound he thought it best to keep him under lock and key Oscar s work shop was a clean well lighted apartment and in it the boy had spent many a stormy Saturday while he was a student at the high school but since he had been employed in the store he had done but little work there for his time was fully occupied from seven in the morning until nine and sometimes ten o clock at night He was glad to find himself there once more for he felt as if he were among friends from whom he had long been separated The side of the room opposite the door was occupied by a carpenter s bench on which were several specimens of Oscar s handiwork such as jointed bass rods models of yachts both sloop and schooner rigged and also a neat little centre table which needed only the staining and polishing to make it ready to take its place in his mother s sitting room At the lower end of the bench was a curtain reaching from the ceiling to the floor Oscar drew aside this curtain revealing a little recess about ten feet square two sides of which were fitted up with shelves At the end opposite the curtain was a wide window and under it was a table filled with little boxes containing glass eyes and an assortment of tools such as taxidermists use The shelves were filled with stuffed birds and animals The most prominent object in the collection was a magnificent gray eagle which leaned forward on his perch with his wings half raised his neck stretched out and his eyes fastened upon a plump mallard standing on one foot in the corner below him with his bill buried under his wing and his eyes closed as if he were fast asleep and so life like did the eagle look that one almost expected to see him leap from his perch and bear the duck off in his talons There were hawks blue jays crows snow buntings grouse quails snipes cedar birds and gold finches upon the shelves in fact almost all the varieties of the feathered creation which were to be found in the woods about Eaton were here represented And they were all arranged with artistic taste too Oscar had carefully studied the habits of every bird and animal he hunted and in his collection there was not one that was awkwardly mounted or that was placed in a position which the bird or animal would not have assumed during his life time A red fox on the lower shelf was creeping along in a crouching attitude evidently meditating an attack upon a wild goose which stood a little distance away engaged in arranging its plumage a snowy owl watched with wide and solemn eyes a gray squirrel sitting upon its haunches and gnawing its way into a hickory nut which it held between its fore paws a butcher bird was engaged in its usual occupation of impaling an insect upon a thorn a hawk was about to begin a meal upon an unfortunate quail it had just captured a mink had its eyes fastened upon a hare which was sitting comfortably in its form a ruffed grouse the last object Oscar had mounted was standing up as straight as an arrow evidently watching the boy as he came in This is the position the grouse always assumes when it is sitting in a tree and sees a hunter approaching It draws itself up so stiffly and remains so motionless that the sportsman often mistakes it for a part of the limb on which it is sitting and passes on without trying a shot at it The birds were all mounted on temporary perches made by nailing two short pieces of wood together in the form of the letter T the standard being set into a block about three inches square to enable them to retain an upright position They were fastened to the perch by the wires that came down through the legs and feet and as the wires extended into the body and assisted to keep the birds in shape the positions of the specimens could be changed in an instant at the will of the taxidermist Oscar had killed and mounted every one of them himself and took no little pride in showing them to his friends CHAPTER V OSCAR RECEIVES A LETTER The young taxidermist walked over to the table and picked up the grouse It was a perfect specimen of his work and he held it off at arm s length and admired it I ll put this in Mr Jackson s case said he as he arranged some of the plumage with a pair of pliers Then I ll put in a pair of quails two English snipes two wood cock that young heron over there and they will be as many as I can stand on the bottom of the case without crowding them too much Then in the tree I ll put an imperial wood pecker and hold on I ve got another gamebird that I can put in the tree The boy was so well pleased with the thought that had just passed through his mind that he laughed outright He put the grouse back upon the table and took from one of the shelves a beautiful bird which was mounted on a board instead of a perch because it was web footed He looked at it closely and found that it was in as good order as when it first came out from under his hands Yes I ll put that in the tree too said he with another laugh and we ll see what Mr Jackson will say when he finds it there Oscar passed along the shelves taking down one specimen after another and when he had selected as many as he thought he could use he went into the shop dropped the curtain to its place and after lighting a fire in the stove took some well seasoned boards from the corner where he had placed them for safe keeping and went to work upon the case During the next few days Oscar toiled early and late Under his skilful hands the case grew in size and shape and when at last it was put together Oscar thrust his hands into his pockets and stood off to make a critical examination of it The front was composed of double glass doors hung on silver plated hinges the joints were tight and taken altogether it was a piece of work with which any cabinet maker would have been entirely satisfied But it was not yet completed The inside was to be ornamented with a painting of a woodland scene and the outside was to be stained in imitation of black walnut Having satisfied himself that his work could not be improved in any way Oscar put on his coat took a small hand saw from the bench and turning the key upon the sleeping Bugle who lay behind the stove dreaming of foxhunts past and to come he bent his steps toward the nearest piece of woods When he came back again an hour later he carried over his shoulder a bundle of small branches which he had cut from hickory saplings Of these he intended to make the tree that was to be put up in the case for the accommodation of some of the specimens He dropped into the post office as he passed by on his way home not because he expected to find anything there but for the reason that it had become a confirmed habit But there was a letter in his mother s box and when the clerk handed it to him he found that it was addressed to himself He opened it as he walked along and the first thing he took out of the envelope was a business card bearing these words CALKINS SON No Court St Yarmouth Poultry Fish Game and Furs sold on Commission Liberal advancements made on consignments A share of the public patronage solicited Humph said Oscar as he thrust the card carelessly into his pocket I don t see what they sent that to me for I can shoot all the game I want and more too And as for fish if I can t supply any three families in town during the season I ll give it up Oscar next took the letter out of the envelope and began reading it in the same careless indifferent way in which he had read the card but before he had gone far he stopped went back to the beginning and read it over again with more interest The letter ran as follows DEAR SIR We intend during the coming winter to make a specialty of small game of all kinds and we wish to engage a competent person in your neighborhood where as we understand partridges quails and rabbits are abundant to shoot for our Yarmouth market We will take all you can send us and you need have no fear of overstocking us The accompanying price current will show you how the market rules at the present date and by examining it carefully you will be able to make an estimate of your probable earnings which ought to be something handsome You have been recommended to us by a gentleman living in your vicinity and we hope you will find it to your interest to return a favorable reply at an early day and begin work for us at once We should like a shipment from you immediately The partridges we are now selling come principally from Michigan and the demand far exceeds the supply Yours etc CALKINS SON Well I declare thought Oscar after he had read the letter over twice in order to fully master the business terms it contained here s another windfall They don t want me to buy of them as I thought they did but they want a chance to buy of me They shall have it I wonder what gentleman it was who was good enough to recommend me to them While Oscar was turning this question over in his mind he glanced at the price current which had been inclosed in the letter and after noting the prices paid for the various kinds of game that were in demand in the Yarmouth market he replaced it in the envelope and began a little problem in mental arithmetic with a view of ascertaining about how much his earnings would amount to each day if he consented to shoot for Calkins Son He based his calculation upon the amount of game he had bagged during some of his previous hunts and in this way he obtained a tolerably fair idea of what his profits would be While he was thus engaged he ran into the outstretched arms of his particular friend Sam Hynes who had been home to dinner and was hurrying back to school Hallo here exclaimed Sam You re just the fellow I want to see What s that on your back Something of which to make a tree to put in a new case of birds I am setting up answered Oscar after he had returned his crony s cordial greeting Say Oscar continued Sam glancing up at the town clock to see how many minutes he could spend in conversation and still reach the school house before the last bell rang what are you going to do next Saturday I shall be quite at your service on that day replied Oscar who knew very well what the question meant Are they coming in yet By hundreds exclaimed Sam with great enthusiasm I have been making inquiries of some farmers who live down the river and they all tell the same story Hang that string out of your window and I ll have you up at half past three We must be on the water at the first peep of day you know Good by This was all that passed between the two friends but they understood each other perfectly Almost every boy has his own way of enjoying himself and Sam Hynes found all his recreation in wild fowl shooting He went fishing sometimes because he liked to be on the river but he could see no fun in jerking a string up and down in the water all day and he preferred to lie back in the boat and watch the clouds as they floated over his head He could see no sport either in tramping about the woods carrying a heavy gun on his shoulders but when it came to shooting over decoys Sam was wide awake and perfectly at home He was the best fellow in the world to go hunting with too If a sudden shower drenched him to the skin and wet his powder so that his gun could not be discharged if the birds flew wild and he returned at night with no more game than he had when he started out in the morning it was all the same to Sam No one ever heard a word of complaint from him He knew how to roast a duck over the flames on a forked stick and could get up so tempting a dinner from the contents of his lunch basket that he was in great demand among the young Nimrods of the village and could have accepted invitations for every Saturday in the year if he had been so disposed But he preferred to hunt with Oscar The latter owned some very fine decoys which he had made and painted himself and he knew how to use them too More than that he was a very lucky young sportsman and those who went with him seldom returned empty handed After taking leave of his friend Oscar continued his walk toward home and before he got there he had finished his problem in mental arithmetic and arrived at the conclusion that he was in a fair way to extricate himself from his financial difficulties and that if the good luck that had followed him ever since he was discharged from the store would only continue for one short year he would be all out of debt and have something in the bank to draw on in case of emergency When Oscar reached home he showed his mother the letter he had received and after spending a few minutes in conversation with her on the subject of market shooting and his chances for making money out of it he went into his work shop and resumed his work On Friday afternoon the case was completed and it was only necessary to wait until the paint on the inside should become dry so that he could put up the tree he had made and place the birds upon it It will be dry to morrow night thought Oscar as he stood with his brush in his hand surveying the woodland scene which ornamented the interior of the case and on Monday morning I will take it over and see what Mr Jackson has to say about it Well boys I am glad to see you Just then the door was thrown open and Sam Hynes came rushing in he was always in a hurry followed by Miles Jackson the nephew of the gentleman for whom the case of birds was intended Sam had dropped in to make sure that the arrangements for the duck hunt on the morrow were fully understood and Miles had come with him to see how Oscar was progressing They did not immediately reply to Oscar s words of greeting for they were too much interested in what they saw before them They looked at the case on all sides admired the picture Oscar had just finished and then they turned their attention to the tree which they examined closely You have got a good fit on these joints said Sam who was himself very handy with tools If you stand a little way from it you would take it for a natural tree It is almost as good a job as I could have done myself What made you drill all these little holes in the branches The wires which support the birds go through those holes and turn up on the other side so that they can t be seen answered Oscar Oh yes I understand Now when do you think What in the world sent that miserable fellow prowling around here I wonder said Sam in an undertone looking at his friend Miles and scowling fiercely This exclamation was called forth by the opening of the door and the entrance of a boy for whom Sam had of late conceived a violent dislike His name was Stuart and he was one of the clerks in Smith Anderson s store The reason Sam disliked him was because he had heard from several sources that Stuart had treated Oscar very rudely ever since Tom ran away with his employers money He would not speak to Oscar at all or even look toward him if he could help it but he had a great deal to say in his presence concerning thieves and defaulting book keepers and cashiers Stuart had better not talk that way in my hearing declared Sam one day when a lot of school boys were talking about Oscar and his troubles and as he said it he doubled up a pair of fists that were pretty large and heavy for a boy of sixteen Oscar is my friend and any fellow who says a word against him can just scratch my name off his good books Mark my words If there was a dishonest clerk in that store he s there yet and if money was missed from the drawer while Oscar was employed there it will be missed now that he is gone Oscar Preston never had a dishonest penny in his hands If Sam had owned the shop he would have ordered Stuart out of it on the instant but as he had no right to do that he simply returned the clerk s bow scowled savagely at his friend Miles and felt like giving Oscar a punch in the ribs because he greeted Stuart so cordially The new comer seemed surprised to find so many boys in the shop and for a minute or two he did not speak He stood with his hand on the latch evidently undecided whether to go out or come in Finally he made up his mind that he would come in I was out delivering goods said he as he closed the door behind him and I thought I would run in for just a moment and see what a taxidermist s shop looks like I have a curiosity to see a bird before it is put up ready for sale All right said Oscar laying down his paint brush I think I can show you some fine specimens Come in here As he spoke he drew aside the curtain and conducted his visitor into the recess while Sam showed what he thought of such a proceeding by picking up a block of wood and hitting the work bench a savage blow with it CHAPTER VI THE AMATEUR DETECTIVE Oscar is too good for any use said Sam turning to Miles and speaking in a low whisper If Stuart had talked about me as I know he has talked about him I d never make up with him in that fashion never Let s go home Oh no whispered Miles in reply I haven t seen any birds yet and neither have you said a word to Oscar about that duck hunt Sam pulled out his knife and hunted around on the bench until he found a pine stick which he proceeded to cut up into the smallest possible pieces while Miles after listening to some explanations that Oscar was making for the benefit of the clerk went into the recess Sam was standing with his back to the three boys but he could distinctly see every move they made On the wall opposite the curtain hung a broken mirror which had once held an honored place in Mrs Preston s parlor Sam glanced into this mirror now and then while he was engaged in cutting up his stick and saw that Stuart was paying very little attention to what Oscar was saying to him He appeared to be very uneasy for he was constantly stepping about and most of the time he kept his eyes fastened intently on Sam When Miles came in and began questioning Oscar about the specimen he was holding in his hands Stuart walked to the other side of the recess ran his eye over the stuffed occupants of the shelves and then he came out into the shop and examined the tree on which Mr Jackson s birds were to be mounted After that he looked at Sam again The latter was standing a little to one side of the mirror with his hat drawn down over his forehead and seemed to see nothing but the stick he was whittling In the work bench directly under the tree was an open drawer in which Oscar kept his paints brushes and various odds and ends Stuart moved up close beside this drawer looked first at Sam then at Miles and Oscar who were still talking earnestly in the recess and as quick as thought pulled something out of his coat pocket raised a sheet of sand paper that lay on the bottom of the drawer and placed the object whatever it was under it This done he backed up against the drawer and pushed it to its place He leaned on the bench for a few seconds looking toward Oscar as if he were listening to what he was saying and then suddenly straightened up I must be going said he starting toward the door I hope I haven t put you to any trouble Oscar None whatever replied the latter And Sam noticed with no little satisfaction that he did not ask the clerk to call again When Stuart closed the door behind him Sam shut up his knife and slammed his stick down in the corner The noise attracted the attention of Miles who looked over his shoulder and was surprised to see Sam holding one forefinger upon his lips and beckoning eagerly to him with the other Miles came out into the shop with an inquiring look on his face while Oscar lingered in the recess to arrange the plumage of one of the specimens which had become rumpled while he was handling it Sam walked over to the drawer of the work bench and opened it standing with his back toward Oscar I know now what that rascal came here for said he in a scarcely audible whisper and I want you for a witness What s that asked Miles in his ordinary tone of voice as his companion raised a sheet of sand paper and brought to light the article Stuart had placed there a few minutes before Say not a word cautioned Sam but come with me and I ll tell you all about it Don t you fellows know that it is very rude to whisper in the presence of a third party said Oscar gravely I am surprised at you You did it while Stuart was in here and I should like to know what you mean by it We didn t want either of you to know what we were talking about answered Sam I wouldn t have treated him as well as you did and I don t think you would have been quite so cordial if you knew as much as we know he added with a significant glance at Miles Oh that s the trouble is it Never mind We were not put here in this world to quarrel with everybody who doesn t like us If we did that we d have time for little else You are not going said Oscar as Sam started for the door with Miles close at his heels Yes we are We have some business that must be attended to at once I ll see you again before I go home Sam banged the door as he ceased speaking and walked through the yard so rapidly that Miles could hardly keep pace with him When he had closed the gate behind him he turned down the sidewalk and hurried on faster than ever Hold up here protested Miles You said you would tell me all about it and how are we going to talk if you go ahead with railroad speed What was it you took out of that drawer and what business had you to touch it I thought it was a pocket book Sam stopped abruptly and drew the article in question from the inside pocket of his coat It was a pocket book and quite a large one too It was made to carry bills at full length It was filled with papers but Sam did not know whether or not there was any money in it for he had not opened it and he did not intend to do so He placed his finger under the silver clasp with which it was fastened and held it up so that his friend could see it What name is that he asked Erastus Smith replied Miles Exactly You saw me take this pocket book out of that drawer didn t you Of course I did Well I know who put it there for I saw him do it Sam brought the pocket book down into his open palm with a sounding whack and looked at his companion as if he thought he had made everything perfectly clear to him but Miles only seemed bewildered I should think you might see through the matter after I have explained it to you said Sam with some impatience But you haven t explained it answered Miles That s so admitted Sam after reflecting a moment I ll do it now while we walk along slowly Stuart put this pocket book in the drawer for as I told you I saw him do it He came into the shop for that very purpose He is the fellow who has been stealing Mr Smith s money but he is trying his level best to fasten the guilt upon Oscar Oh I begin to understand the matter said Miles his face flushing with indignation Now the credit for the discovery I have made does not belong to me continued Sam who was as truthful and honest as he was blunt and fearless I never should have thought of it if it hadn t been for something Mr Parker said to me He told me the other day that if there had been any stealing going on in that store since Tom Preston left Stuart was the guilty one and the reason Mr Parker suspected him was because he has had so much to say against Oscar He has told everybody in town who would listen to him that Oscar was discharged for till tapping and there were a good many who would listen to him for there are people everywhere you know who take unbounded delight in hearing others slandered I had two reasons for watching every move Stuart made while he was in the shop I thought it would be a good plan to keep an eye on him and I was impatient to see him start for the door I didn t want him there It was a wonder he didn t see that you were watching him observed Miles Do you remember that broken looking glass that hangs on the north wall of the shop asked Sam I looked in there and saw everything he did Miles was astonished at his companion s shrewdness and could only look the admiration he felt for him But what made you rush out of the shop in such a hurry he inquired at length Why didn t you tell Oscar all about it and relieve his mind at once Oh it will not hurt him to wait a day or two longer rejoined Sam and his vindication will be all the more welcome when it comes as I am determined it shall come through the man who has injured him Mr Smith has done Oscar a great deal of harm and he must lose no time in undoing it Now then here we are Sam stepped upon the threshold of Smith Anderson s store seized the latch with a determined grip as if he were trying to break it in two threw open the door and walked in The first person he met was Stuart who started back in surprise at the sight of him He was greatly alarmed Sam could see that plainly and he tried to conceal it by stepping briskly behind the counter and drawing the order book toward him What can I do for you boys he asked as he held his pencil poised over the book Nothing growled Sam who could not possibly have spoken civilly to one whom he had caught in the act of trying to ruin his friend He kept on his way toward the office and Stuart as if divining his intention said hurriedly and in a low tone of voice There s no one in there Sam Mr Anderson has gone to the depot to see about some freight and Mr Smith has just stepped out In fact he has gone home and won t be back to night Any word to leave for either of them Sam shook his head and walked right on That s a little too transparent said he to Miles who kept close at his side What did he want to whisper for and why did he turn so red in the face I ll warrant Mr Anderson isn t near the depot and that we shall find Mr Smith perched on his high stool He s always there since Tom went away At that moment as if to confirm his words the back door opened and Mr Anderson came in He was bareheaded and had no overcoat on Moreover he carried a number of packages in his arms and that was all the proof the boys needed to convince them that he had been busy in the warehouse When they entered the office they found the senior partner right where Sam said they would find him on his high stool He laid down his pen and looked at the boys over his spectacles just as he had looked at Oscar on the day he discharged him Mr Smith said Sam may we have a few minutes private conversation with you I suppose so was the reply Is it very private Well we would rather you alone should hear what we have to say If you choose to repeat it that is your own affair As Sam spoke he closed the door behind him and turned the key in the lock Bless my soul exclaimed the grocer what s the matter Mr Smith said Sam without replying to the question have you lost any money lately Not a cent since Oscar went away was the prompt reply Now let me tell you what s a fact exclaimed Sam We didn t come here to listen to any hard words against Oscar Preston and if you are going to use them we ll not stay We ll tell you that much to begin with We will tell you further that you have made no friends by the slanderous reports you have circulated regarding that boy I have circulated no slanderous reports about him replied the grocer who could scarcely believe his ears I said that I didn t think he was honest and I say so yet Yes the story is all over town that you discharged Oscar because you thought he had taken money out of your drawer but all the best people here know that he never did it You say you have lost nothing lately Do you happen to own a pocket book about so long and so wide said Sam placing his hands upon the desk and indicating by them the length and breadth of the article he was describing Mr Smith started as if he had been shot and got off his high stool with such haste that he would have gone headlong to the floor if Miles had not caught him and placed him fairly on his feet again He opened the door of a large safe that stood in one corner of the office and unlocking a little drawer on the inside pulled it out and looked into it Great Moses he ejaculated it is gone I thought so said Sam Was there anything of value in it Was there shouted Mr Smith trembling all over with excitement There was a hundred and fifty dollars in money in it and negotiable paper to the amount of eight hundred dollars more Have you seen it Sam Have you got it Hand it out here Now don t try to rush matters said Sam whose cool deliberate way of talking and acting so exasperated the excited grocer that he could hardly refrain from laying violent hands upon him and searching his pockets This thing must be done decently and in order or it can t be done at all I certainly have a pocket book in my possession but I want to be sure that it belongs to you before I hand it over to you Here Miles look at it while Mr Smith describes it That s it that s it cried the grocer catching a momentary glimpse of the pocket book as Sam handed it to his companion I would know it among a thousand It s mine Give it to me He made an effort to snatch it but Sam was too quick for him He succeeded in placing it in Miles s hands and the latter held fast to it Sam cried the angry and astonished grocer picking up a heavy ruler and banging it down upon his desk do you think I would tell you a falsehood Do you take me for a thief All I have to say about that is if we want people to put implicit faith in us we must be careful how we accuse others of wrong answered Sam boldly Now what sort of a pocket book is it Miles had moved up close to the window and stood with his back toward the grocer holding the pocket book in his hand and waiting for him to describe it He thought he was well acquainted with Sam Hynes but he told himself now that he had never before known what sort of a fellow he was He was astonished at Sam s impudence Mr Smith was one of the oldest business men in Eaton and although he was so close in his dealings and thought so much of a dollar that he had never gained the respect or good will of the majority of the people he had never been suspected of dishonesty or untruthfulness And Sam did not by any means suspect him now He simply wished to show Mr Smith that he had been handling a two edged sword that was liable to cut both ways CHAPTER VII OFF FOR THE RIVER What sort of a pocket book is it repeated Sam Look for my name on the clasp said Mr Smith who was so nervous and impatient that he could not stand still I see it said Miles Then it is my property and you might as well hand it out here at once said the grocer I want to know how much I have lost without any more trifling There s no trifling about this replied Sam There is more than one Erastus Smith in the world who is able to own a pocket book like that Go on Open it and look for a hundred dollars in paper money and fifty dollars in gold said Mr Smith with an air of resignation I find no such sum here answered Miles after he had looked through the pocket book All I see is a single five dollar note Mr Smith groaned Almost thirty two hundred dollars in clean cash gone out of the firm in less than eight months said he with a long drawn sigh That cuts down the profits fearfully fearfully I find here some bills receivable Good exclaimed the grocer I am glad the thief left them There ought to be between eight and nine hundred dollars worth of them Mr Smith then went on to give a description of the bills which were endorsed and filed in nearly the same order in which he referred to them So retentive was his memory that he could recall the dates of a good many of them give their exact wording and tell the color of the paper and ink that were used in writing them After he had gone through half a dozen of the bills in this way Miles turned and looked at Sam Are you satisfied asked the latter I am replied Miles Then hand it over Mr Smith snatched the pocket book as it was extended toward him and climbed to his place upon the high stool Where did you get this said he In a drawer in Oscar Preston s work bench replied Sam Ah said the grocer in a very significant tone of voice Now the next question is How did it come there The answer almost took Mr Smith s breath away Your favorite clerk Will Stuart put it there for I saw him do it said Sam And then he went on to describe in as few words as possible what Stuart had done while he was in Oscar s shop and explained the object he had in view in taking the pocket book out of the drawer without Oscar s knowledge Mr Smith pushed his spectacles over his forehead and listened intently to all the boy had to say and when Sam ceased speaking he brought his hand down upon his desk with a ringing slap I wondered why Stuart was so eager to drive the delivery wagon this afternoon and this explains it said he I see it all now Stuart knew that I do not often have occasion to open that little drawer in the safe and he probably took the book a day or two ago I know it was there last Saturday for I saw it thinking that if he placed it in Oscar s bench where it would certainly have been found if we had taken out a search warrant we would believe that he stole it before he was discharged You have no objection to facing Stuart I suppose None whatever Sam promptly replied that is just what we came here for Mr Smith climbed down from his high stool unlocked and opened the door and looked out into the store The only person he saw there was the junior partner Send Stuart here will you said he Stuart has gone home was the reply He had a sudden attack of sick headache Oh he did did he exclaimed Sam It must have been very sudden for he was well enough ten minutes ago Mr Anderson came into the office in obedience to a sign from his partner and was speedily made acquainted with the object of the boys visit He was almost overwhelmed with astonishment and declared that he never would have believed it of Stuart Now Mr Smith said Sam when there was a little pause in the conversation we will leave this matter in your hands I am ready to be a witness at any time if you decide to prosecute but I shall not spread any damaging reports about Stuart and neither will Miles We don t believe in hitting a person when he s down We have one favor to ask of you and that is that you will make Oscar all the amends in your power for the great injustice you have done him I know what my duty is under the circumstances young gentlemen said Mr Smith shortly He had got his pocket book back and eight hundred dollars worth of bills and he felt a little more independent The boys picked up their caps and left the store while Mr Smith mounted his high stool and mopped his face vigorously with his handkerchief The exciting scene through which he had just passed had brought the perspiration out on his forehead in big drops I had no idea that Sam Hynes was such a bad boy said he to his partner He wouldn t give up that pocket book until I proved its contents and I have done business right here in this town for almost half a century He had the impudence to tell me in effect that if I didn t want to be suspected of dishonesty myself I must not be in such haste to suspect others I declare he s a wonderful bad boy wonderful Meanwhile Sam was walking down the street with his hands in his pockets whistling merrily and taking such strides that Miles after trying in vain to keep up seized him by the arm and held him back Sam said he how dare you talk that way to a grown man If I had been Mr Smith I would have boxed your ears for you Sam looked up at the clouds and laughed heartily You might have got your hands full said he What will your father say when he hears of it continued Miles He ll hear of it as soon as he comes home to night replied Sam I make it a point never to do a thing that I am afraid or ashamed to have him know and I shall tell him of it myself He ll give me a good going over for not being more respectful to gray hairs but I deserve it and I ll never do the like again never added Sam who wished now when it was too late that he had remembered that Mr Smith was the grandfather of two of the members of the ball club to which he belonged I knew well enough that he wouldn t lay claim to any but his own property but he thought I was suspicious of him and it cut him didn t it Perhaps he ll know now how Oscar felt to be unjustly accused Going to turn off here Well good by I promised to see Oscar again you know I ll drop around to morrow night and leave a brace of ducks for your Sunday dinner Now Miles Sam finished the sentence by shaking his finger at his friend and then placing it upon his closed lips I understand and I ll bear it in mind too was the reply Good by and good luck to you When Sam entered the shop where Oscar was still at work the latter had a good many questions to ask regarding his abrupt departure a few minutes before but Sam being all ready for him gave his inquiries prompt replies which although they satisfied Oscar s curiosity did not let him into the secret of the matter The young taxidermist thought his friend appeared to be very jubilant and well he might for he had done something to be proud of Suppose a constable had come up there with a search warrant and found Mr Smith s property in the place where Stuart had left it Oscar would have been in trouble indeed The latter did not know what a narrow escape he had had that day and it was no part of his companion s plan to enlighten him Sam never talked about his exploits He sat on the bench with his hands under his legs school boy fashion pounded with the heels of his boots against the drawer in which the pocket book had been concealed and talked incessantly about the duck hunt that was to come off the next day When all their plans had been discussed Sam said good night and left the shop As soon as Oscar had eaten his supper he went up to his room and when he came down again he carried a game bag powder flask and shot pouch in one hand and a double barrel gun in the other Oscar s gun was not just the weapon that one would expect to see after listening to the description of it which Leon Parker had given his cousin It was a good deal larger and heavier than the little bird gun which held so prominent a place in Leon s estimation but it was not a blunderbuss and there were several boys and men too in the village who would have been glad to purchase it at any figures the owner might have put upon it But it had once belonged to his father and Oscar would not have parted with it for any consideration It was known all over the country as a brag shooting gun and among all the young hunters in the neighborhood there were but few who could show as many birds at the end of a day s hunt as Oscar could Its weight was no detriment to him for his strong muscles enabled him to handle it very easily and quickly and he seldom missed a double shot when the opportunity to make it was presented to him Having received a thorough rubbing inside and out the weapon was set away in one corner with a couple of corks in the muzzles and an oiled rag over the tubes to keep out the dust and two hours later Oscar was snug in bed wrapped in a dreamless slumber One of his windows was raised about three inches and through this opening ran a stout cord one end of which was tied to a chair standing at the head of Oscar s bed the other reached down to the ground and was securely fastened to a rose bush Shortly after four o clock in the morning Bugle who always slept on the front porch when the weather was warm enough to permit it challenged someone who came into the yard and soon thereafter the cord began to saw up and down over the window sill The chair moved but Oscar slept on all unconscious of it The person below waited and listened a few seconds and then renewed his pulls at the string putting considerably more strength and energy into them This time the chair was upset with a loud crash and Oscar jumped up and hurried to the window It was too dark to see anybody but he knew who was there We ll have to make haste for I overslept myself said Sam Hynes s well known voice Did I do any damage up there I heard something come down pretty hard Oh no was the reassuring answer Have you had any breakfast Of course not I intend to get it here All right I ll be down in five minutes Oscar dressed himself with all haste and when he went downstairs he found Sam waiting for him at the back door Bugle entered when Sam did he always kept as close to a gun as he could and frisked about in high glee thrashing the boys with his heavy tail and continually getting in their way Splendid morning said Sam as he leaned his gun up in one corner Warm and foggy more like spring than fall The ducks always fly low during a fog What can I do to help you Nothing at all Just sit down and make yourself comfortable The fire is laid and it will take but a few minutes to make a cup of coffee You think it is going to be a good day do you Then I ought to make some money before night Calkins Son of Yarmouth have written me a letter offering to take all the game I can send them You don t say so exclaimed Sam I am glad to hear it He did not tell Oscar that he knew all about it but such was the fact He knew that Mr Parker had been down to the city to attend to some legal business for that very firm and it was when he was looking about their store and listening while Mr Calkins expressed his regrets that he could not secure game enough to supply the demand which was unusually great just then that the lawyer happened to think of Oscar whom he recommended as the best person Mr Calkins could engage to shoot for him The latter seeing that his visitor was interested in the boy said he would try to secure his services and if he succeeded he would pay him for his game as soon as it was received and not wait to sell it on commission Mr Parker gave the merchant Oscar s address and that was the way our hero came to be a market shooter Sam we repeat knew all about it but he listened while Oscar talked of the offer he had received and acted as though everything he heard was news to him The fire was soon cracking away merrily and while waiting for the kettle to boil Oscar busied himself in setting the table Bugle finding that he was entirely neglected called attention to himself by uttering a deafening bay Silence exclaimed Oscar That will never do He will disturb mother We must shut him up Bugle is no good for ducks I ll fix him said Sam Take your gun with you suggested Oscar as Sam took the key of the shop down from its nail You ll never get him in there if you don t Bugle was quite ready to accompany Sam when he saw the boy pick up his double barrel that is he was ready to accompany him to the woods but he would not follow him to the shop He ran out of the wood shed and thrusting his head in at the door looked at Sam but he could not be induced to go near him Oscar could hear his friend coaxing and scolding and finally a suppressed whine from Bugle told him that Sam had been obliged to collar the animal and drag him into his prison A hearty breakfast having been disposed of a lunch was stowed away in Oscar s game bag and the boys were ready for the start In the wood shed they found a light wheelbarrow which contained the decoys they were to use during the hunt and also the sail and oars belonging to Oscar s boat Sam took his friend s gun under his arm Oscar set the wheelbarrow in motion and with Bugle s farewell ringing in their ears they set out for the river at a rapid walk Illustration BUGLE RECOGNIZES HIS ENEMIES CHAPTER VIII A FORTUNATE DUCK HUNT The young hunters found Oscar s skiff where the owner had left it drawn high and dry upon the bank and fastened with a lock and chain to a tree that stood a short distance below Mr Peck s boat house Mr Peck who made a business of fishing and renting sail and row boats for the accommodation of the village pleasure seekers was standing on his wharf when the boys came up Going ducking said he Well I ll tell you what I wish you would do for me he added upon receiving an affirmative reply I let one of my boats yesterday afternoon to a stranger to go down to Cottonwood He was to have been back before dark but I aint seen no signs of him yet Didn t look to me like a man who would be likely to run off with a boat because he wore a gold watch and gold spectacles and that showed that he was able to buy a boat if he d wanted one How long has this fog been on asked Oscar Ever since midnight Then perhaps he became bewildered and tied up somewhere to wait for the fog to lift continued Oscar If he is a stranger of course he doesn t know the river I don t see how in the world he could get bewildered observed Sam If he had rowed over to this bank and come straight up stream he would have found the village without any trouble He certainly knew enough for that Well I aint so certain of it neither Sam said Mr Peck Pears to me now that I think of it that he didn t know much of anything I give him my best boat too for he looked as though he was able to pay for it I wish you d kinder keep an eye out for him and set him right if he has missed his reckoning We ll do it Mr Peck said Sam Oscar unlocked his boat turned it right side up with his companion s assistance and pushed it into the water Here again Leon s description was at fault Oscar s craft was not a leaky old scow it was a light easy running skiff As he had built it himself of course it was not as finely modelled as some of Mr Peck s costly boats but it answered the purpose for which it was intended Leon had seen it come up to Mr Peck s wharf almost filled with wild ducks It had more than once beaten his nice little boat in a fair race up the river from Squaw Island It was named after Sam s sister Katie the prettiest girl in the village who seemed to prefer Oscar s company to Leon s and perhaps these were the reasons why the latter could not speak well of it The skiff having been launched the sail was put into it The game bags were stowed away in a little locker in the bow the guns were carefully loaded and put in their proper places one in the stern and the other on the midship thwart and then Sam shipped the rudder while Oscar got out the oars and rowed away into the fog In five minutes Mr Peck s wharf and boat house were out of sight and the boys found themselves enveloped in a cloud which concealed everything that was more than twenty yards distant from their boat How will this do Sam said Oscar resting on his oars Do you hear that asked his companion in reply I think we had better go a little further out Oscar thought so too He dipped the oars into the water again and the boat moved deeper into the fog The sound that had attracted Sam s attention was made by a solitary whistle wing as he pursued his way down the river Oscar pulled steadily for five minutes longer and then the oars were allowed to swing around by the side of the boat and each boy picking up his gun squared about on his seat and waited for a quarter of a minute only They had scarcely taken their positions before a flock of mallards suddenly emerged from the fog flying so close to the water that the young hunters could have knocked them down with their guns if they had continued on their way but of course they did not The ducks arose in the air and sheered off the instant they discovered the boat and the boys sprang to their feet at the same time As the flock flew over their heads they turned away from each other and when the birds had passed the boat discharged their double barrels in quick succession They pulled the triggers so nearly at the same instant that the four reports sounded like two Learn two things here in regard to shooting on the wing if you do not know them already Never fire at a wild fowl as he is coming toward you The thick feathers on his breast will glance the shot and if some of them do not chance to hit him in the head he will continue on his way unharmed Wait until he has passed you then aim low and a little in advance of him keeping both eyes open and holding so that you can see daylight between him and the muzzle of your gun then the shot will pass under his feathers and in a few seconds more you can put him in your game bag If you are hunting with a companion don t turn toward him when you are getting ready to shoot but turn away from him Then if you accidentally discharge your gun in your excitement but remember that you must not allow yourself to become excited the shot will go up into the empty air and no one will be injured That will do for a beginning said Sam when the smoke had cleared away so that the boys could see the effect of their shot How many ducks were there in that flock About thirty said Oscar and they were all mallards too Well we ve got two four hold on there Sam fell to reloading his gun with all possible haste while Oscar quickly resumed his seat picked up the oars and turned the boat s head down the stream Three of the ducks had come down with broken wings and were now swimming rapidly away into the fog It did not take Sam much longer to charge his old fashioned muzzle loader than it would take you to charge your new fashioned breech loader He never used loose shot during a hunt On rainy days when he had nothing else to do he put up a lot of cartridges He first made a number of paper bags a little smaller than the bore of his gun and glued a wad fast to one end of them When they became dry he filled them with different kinds of shot putting bird shot in one and duck shot in another closed the bag and fastened another wad at that end Then all he had to do when he wanted to load his gun was to pour in the powder from his flask drive home a couple of these cartridges which he carried loose in his coat pocket put on the caps which he carried loose in his vest pocket and the weapon was ready to be discharged All this he did in the same space of time that Oscar occupied in turning the boat around He made sure work of two of the wounded ducks and the other which seemed too badly hurt to dive was knocked on the head with an oar They secured seven ducks that time and twelve more out of three other flocks which passed over their heads within the next twenty minutes Now let me row awhile said Sam when the last bird had been picked up You are doing all the work and I am having all the fun Yes you have had all the best of it answered Oscar as he exchanged places with his companion It is going to blow now and this fog will all be gone in ten minutes I think we had better go down to the head of the island and put out our decoys It turned out just as Oscar said it would The breeze which had sprung up since they left the shore grew stronger every minute the fog rapidly faded away and in a quarter of an hour the young hunters had a clear river before them The village was out of sight behind the point and Squaw Island their favorite camping and shooting ground was in plain view and about two miles away Oscar directed the boat toward it and Sam after taking off his coat laid out his strength on the oars The wind came up the river in strong but fitful gusts and finally raised a sea that made the little boat dance about right merrily I don t think we are going to have such a splendid day after all observed Sam who had grown very weatherwise during his numerous excursions down the river I wish this wind would hold up and let the fog settle down again I don t like it Neither does that fellow answered Oscar looking over his companion s shoulder toward some object further down the river The wind must be cutting up some strange shines down there or else he doesn t know what he is about Just look at him Sam released his hold upon the oars allowing them to swing back alongside the skiff and facing about on his seat directed his gaze down the river Off the head of Squaw Island he discovered a sail boat which was acting in a very singular manner The wind was blowing straight up the river and it would have been no trouble at all for one who understood his business to make rapid headway against the current But it soon became plain to Oscar and Sam both of whom were as good sailors as boys ever get to be who have had no opportunity to try their skill on deep water that the man who was seated at the helm of the sail boat did not understand his business Instead of letting out the sheet as he ought to have done he had drawn it taut at the same time holding the bow of his boat up the river The consequence was that the sail was shaking violently and he was making no headway at all That s the boat Mr Peck is looking for said Sam and if that is the way she has been handled ever since she left the village I don t wonder that she didn t get back last night Perhaps we had better go down there replied Oscar That man doesn t seem to be quite up to my gracious There he goes Give me an oar quick Before the words had fairly left Oscar s lips one of the oars was unshipped and placed in his hands The sail boat had been upset through the ignorance or carelessness of her skipper The latter becoming dissatisfied with the very slow progress he was making had brought his craft around upon the other tack but he did not change his own position He pushed the boom over his head as it swung around and instead of moving over to the windward side he kept his seat on the leeward gunwale and his own weight added to the weight of the sail and the pressure of the wind against the canvas overturned the boat before he could think twice If you ever pulled in your life pull now exclaimed Oscar as he shipped his oar and tugged at it until he fairly made things snap You re stroke do your level best cried Sam You ll not drive your end of the boat ahead of mine I ll promise you that Oscar s skiff had never travelled so rapidly under the white ash breeze before The boys being both good oarsmen knew how to make every stroke tell and they brought all their strength and skill into requisition Guided by Sam who sat in the bow and looked over his shoulder occasionally to make sure of her course the Katie flew over the waters like a wild fowl on the wing and in much less time than the boys had expected she came up with and passed the overturned boat which was floating bottom up with the current The young hunters ceased rowing and springing to their feet looked in every direction They could see nobody and the fear that after all their efforts they had arrived too late to save the luckless skipper of the sail boat was already half formed in their minds when a shrill piping voice called to them from the water This way if you please I have met with a most untoward accident and I believe I am in need of a little assistance Well he is a cool one whoever he is said Sam in a low tone If I were in his situation I should think I stood in need of a good deal of assistance Illustration JUST IN TIME Sam quickly shipped the oar which his companion handed to him and pulled toward the disabled boat while Oscar threw off his coat pushed back his sleeves and jumping upon the stern sheets showed Sam by signs how to guide the skiff A few of the latter s long sweeping strokes brought them around the stern of the sail boat and there clinging to the swaying rudder with both hands and apparently so nearly overcome by his sudden immersion in the cold water that he was on the very point of letting go his hold was a bald headed old gentleman in spectacles As the boys came up he extended one hand toward them and at the same instant the other slipped off the rudder He went down like a piece of lead and in a second more would have been out of sight had not Oscar dashed forward plunged his arms into the water up to his shoulders and seized him by the collar This action on his part would have overturned the skiff in an instant or else Oscar would have gone overboard had it not been for an equally prompt action on the part of Sam Hynes The latter who never lost his head under any circumstances threw himself as far as he could over the opposite side of the boat to counterbalance Oscar s weight at the same time bracing his feet firmly and seizing his friend by the waistband of his trousers Hang on to him he shouted and I can trim the boat and heave you both in Sam was noted among his fellows for his strength but on this occasion it seemed that he had undertaken more than he could accomplish The skipper of the sail boat was so completely benumbed with the cold and so nearly strangled that he could not help himself Oscar was pretty large and heavy for a boy of his age and Sam found that it was not so easy to haul them both into the boat But after pulling and tugging until he was red in the face he succeeded in bringing Oscar to an upright position so that the latter could use some of his own strength and then the work was quickly done The old gentleman was pulled over the side and placed on the bottom of the skiff where he would be somewhat protected from the wind Sam s hat was put upon his head and Oscar s coat was snugly wrapped about his shoulders He had had a very narrow escape but to the great amazement of the boys who had saved him he did not seem to be at all disconcerted He wiped the water from his face coughed once or twice and said in a shrill voice addressing himself to Oscar This is neither the time nor the place young gentleman to thank you for the gallant service you have rendered me but I assure you it shall not be forgotten I have to day received a new insight into meteorological phenomena of which I have been a close student for a life time Winds as I now know are How long the rescued man would have continued to talk in this strain it is hard to tell but just then he began to shiver all over and his teeth chattered so violently that he could not utter a word The boys who had listened to this speech with the greatest astonishment exchanging significant glances the while were recalled to themselves by these signs of suffering CHAPTER IX THE CAMP ON THE ISLAND Give me an oar exclaimed Oscar We must get back to the village without the loss of a moment Then hoist the sail said Sam and we ll go up flying It would be of no use The wind is dying away and that fog will be down on us in a quarter of an hour thicker than ever Oscar who pulled the stroke oar kept his friend Sam exceedingly busy during the next forty five minutes and tested that young gentleman s endurance and muscle in a way they had never been tested before They were both tired and quite out of breath when they reached the wharf where they found Mr Peck and Mr Hall the miller waiting for them The boys were glad to see Mr Hall there His grist mill was located but a few rods away and they knew that there was a good fire in the office in front of which their half frozen passenger would soon be thoroughly dried and thawed out The two men had seen the skiff coming up the river and knowing by the way the oars were handled that there was something wrong they had waited to see what it was When they discovered the rescued man sitting on the bottom of the boat they knew what had happened and there was no need of inquiries Give us your hand sir said Mr Hall as the boys lifted the old gentleman to his feet and I ll take you right over to my office I ve got a red hot stove there Just catch hold of his other arm Sam and help him along Where did you find him asked Mr Peck when he was left alone with Oscar And where s my boat We saw him capsize off the head of the island replied the boy Didn t I tell you that he didn t seem to know much of anything exclaimed Mr Peck in disgust There s no excuse for upsetting that boat in this wind None whatever was Oscar s answer When he jibed the sail he didn t move over to windward and it was his weight and the sails that overturned the boat The wind wasn t to blame for it at all We left the boat as we found it keel up and going down the river as fast as the current could take it Our passenger was so nearly exhausted that we couldn t stop to pick it up Mr Peck remarked that he would go down after it himself and charge the bald headed old gentleman a good round sum too for his carelessness and just then Sam came back wearing one of Mr Hall s old caps and carrying Oscar s coat over his arm He had left his own cap he said for the gentleman to wear for of course he couldn t let him walk to his hotel bareheaded While Sam was speaking he jumped down into the boat which was at once pushed out into the stream and headed toward Squaw Island The young hunters had lost more than an hour and a half of the best part of the day but still there was time enough for them to double the size of their bag if the ducks would only be accommodating enough to come within range of their double barrels Contrary to Oscar s predictions the breeze which had so suddenly sprung up and driven off the fog continued to blow steadily for three hours Within twenty minutes after leaving Mr Peck s wharf they reached the island but they did not add a single duck to their bag on the way They saw plenty of birds but every flock flew wild Oscar at once put Sam and his double barrel on shore and then pulled back into the stream a short distance to set out his decoys While he was thus employed Sam was engaged in cutting branches from the willows that grew near by and filling up the gaps the winds had made in the blind they had put up there the year before It was built upon the top of a little knoll about thirty yards from the place where the decoys were anchored and so completely was it concealed by the tall weeds and grass which grew on every side that anyone who did not know just where to look for it would have hard work to find it When their preparations were all completed the skiff was hidden in a little bay surrounded by the thicket of willows before spoken of and the boys with their guns in their hands sat down behind their blind opposite two loopholes which commanded a view as far up as the point and talked over the incidents of the morning while waiting for the first flock of ducks to swing to their decoys They came to three conclusions concerning the man they had saved from going to the bottom of the river He was well to do in the world judging by his appearance he knew something about physical geography and he was not a proper person to be entrusted with the management of a sail boat Thus far they agreed and then they began to differ in their opinions Sam declared that there was something wrong with his upper story No man with a level head on his shoulders would talk as he did immediately after being rescued from a watery grave Oscar however had other ideas and as it happened they were correct He is completely wrapped up in his books said the boy Perhaps he does not know much outside of them but you take him there and he is perfectly at home There s more knowledge in that little bald head of his than you and I can ever hope to acquire Sam shrugged his shoulders with an air which said Perhaps there is and perhaps there isn t and just then the discussion was cut short by the appearance of a flock of mallards which drew to their decoys They circled around them once or twice and were on the point of alighting among them when one wary old fellow in the flock not liking the looks of the wooden deceptions mounted higher into the air with a warning quack Some of the flock followed him and others tried to do so but could not Even the wary old fellow himself did not go far for Oscar brought him down in company with two others before his warning note was fairly uttered The volley was not as effective as the boys intended it should be for only five ducks fell The current carried them to the shore in a few minutes and Oscar brought them in and placed them behind the blind The sport continued for two hours and a half and then the breeze having died away the fog settled down again this time bringing rain with it When the decoys were shut out from view the boys laid aside their guns and Oscar after placing his game bag within easy reach of his friend s hand arose to his feet and walked off toward the willows while Sam began to cut up some dry branches with his knife By the time Oscar returned with an armful of wood he had found in the thicket Sam had raised a good sized pile of shavings and kindling wood and a roaring fire was under way in short order While Oscar continued to make regular trips between the thicket and the fire bringing his arms full of wood each time Sam selected a duck from the pile behind the blind plucked and cleaned it with skill that would have done credit to any professional cook and having impaled it upon a forked stick thrust the stick into the ground beside the fire and left it there while he proceeded to overhaul the contents of his game bag and Oscar s The dinner being well under way and all the firewood they were likely to need having been placed close at hand the young hunters sat down to take a rest for the exertions they had made to rescue the skipper of the sail boat and carry him to the village before he froze to death had wearied them not a little Now and then a hoarse quack quack came to their ears through the thick mist followed by a loud splashing in the water as a flock of ducks settled into if and occasionally they heard a lonely whistle wing flying down the river but the fog concealed everything from their view outside of a radius of twenty yards and they were reluctantly compelled to allow the birds to pass unharmed They had made themselves comfortable in spite of the moist condition of things The branches that Oscar had spread over the ground kept their feet out of the mud the high blind behind which the fire was built served to protect them from the gusts of rain that came out of the fog and the boys were well contented and were prepared to enjoy their dinner as heartily as though they had a tight roof over their heads The dinner was well worth eating as all Sam s dinners were and when ample justice had been done to it Oscar brought up the ducks that were in the boat and placed them with those that were piled behind the blind Sam said he when he had counted them we ve got just forty two A pretty good day s work replied Sam I want six of them You take the rest and ship them to Yarmouth I guess not answered Oscar promptly We ll divide as we have always done Twenty one of these ducks belong to you and if you want any of them shipped to the city you can attend to the matter yourself So I can I didn t think of that Sam spoke as though he did not care what was done with the ducks but there was something in his tone that caused Oscar to sit up on his knees and look at him very sharply He knew well enough that if Sam sent any of the ducks to Yarmouth they would be sent in his Oscar s name and that his friend would expect him to receive the proceeds and apply them to his own use Sam did not need the money himself for he had a rich and indulgent father but that made no difference to Oscar who wanted to earn every cent he spent Sam said he earnestly if you do that I shall be very angry at you If I do what returned Sam innocently Oh you can t fool me If you do it I ll never go hunting with you again Then I ll not do it of course but I don t know what you mean all the same Now as we have nothing else to do let s draw these birds Our shooting is over for the day And so it proved The boys remained behind their blind until it was three o clock by Sam s watch but not another duck showed himself They heard them splashing in the water on both sides of the island but the mist shut them out from view The rain having by this time put out their fire and the birds having been cleaned and made ready for the market the skiff was launched the ducks were packed away in the bows the guns and empty game bags were stowed in the stern and after the decoys had been picked up the boys pulled through the fog toward the village When they came alongside the wharf they found Mr Peck and Mr Hall there as before The former was hard at work upon the wreck of his sail boat which he had found near the foot of the island and towed home after infinite trouble and Mr Hall stood by with his hands in his pockets looking at him Well boys said the miller your crazy man is all right He stayed by my stove until he was warmed and dried and then he started for his hotel There exclaimed Sam turning to Oscar with a triumphant air What did I tell you Didn t I say he was cracked That accounts for his upsetting the boat remarked Mr Peck I knew well enough that no man who had any sense into his head could capsize in such a breeze as he did There is something wrong with him continued Mr Hall While he was standing there shivering in front of my stove he discovered my pet squirrels and canaries and he walked over to their cages and talked to them in the strangest language I ever heard I took it to be Greek or Latin He said he had been down the river after what did he call those things he was looking for Peck Blessed if I know was the answer I never heard of any such things before He s got an idea that he is connected with some college continued Mr Hall and that somebody has given him a lot of money to spend in some foolish way He didn t think until he got ready to start for his hotel that he had lost his gun when his boat upset The only sensible thing he did while he was in my office was to give me ten dollars to pay Mr Peck for his trouble and take down Oscar s name and street I told him that you had a fancy for shooting birds and animals and he said he would make it a point to drop around and see you As the miller ceased speaking he walked off toward his office Mr Peck resumed his work upon the wreck Oscar went into the boat house after his wheelbarrow and Sam began unloading the skiff When everything had been taken out of it the boat was drawn up on the bank turned bottom upward and made fast to a tree with a chain and padlock The sail and the oars belonging to it as well as the decoys were stowed away in one corner of Mr Peck s boat house where they were to remain until Oscar could find time to come after them The ducks made as large a load as he could take to the village in his wheelbarrow When all this work had been done Sam selected six of the finest ducks from the pile and after tying their feet together with a piece of stout twine placed them by the side of the boat house out of the way and began to assist Oscar in packing the others away in the wheelbarrow Hold on there exclaimed the latter How many did you put in then Don t know answered Sam depositing another armful on top of the first Didn t count em But I want you to count them I own just twenty one of these ducks Don t you want the others Of course not We re going to divide Those ducks will all have to come out of that wheelbarrow again so that I can count them All right exclaimed Sam out they come And suiting the action to the word he overturned the wheelbarrow spilling the ducks upon the wharf Now count them yourself said he and then you ll know that you have got what you want Oscar proceeded to count out his share of the birds which he packed away in the wheelbarrow and having placed his gun game bag and powder and shot flasks on top of them he stopped and looked around for Sam He was standing near the shore end of the wharf with his double barrel on one shoulder and his bunch of game slung over the other If you are all ready come on said he But what are you going to do with the rest of those ducks I am not going to do anything with them If it is too much trouble for you to ship them to the city and make forty cents a pair out of them you had better leave them where they are I ve got all I want Oscar looked first at his friend then at the ducks and finally began packing them away in the wheelbarrow with the others while Sam struck up a lively whistle to keep from laughing outright He had done his best shooting that day on purpose to make a large bag fully intending that Oscar should ship the surplus birds and receive pay for them and this was the way he took to accomplish his object Indeed he almost always found a way to make Oscar do just as he wanted him to do Having placed the game in the hands of the express agent at the depot and sent a notice of shipment to Calkins Son the two boys started for home well satisfied with their day s sport CHAPTER X AN ASTOUNDING OFFER Oscar was very tired when he reached home that night but he spent some hours at his bench before he went to bed He was anxious to have his case of birds ready for delivery by the time it had been promised So as soon as he had eaten his supper and answered all the questions his mother had to ask regarding the man he and Sam had saved from drowning he lighted the lamp in his shop and went to work Everything being ready to his hand he made rapid progress and when he locked his shop at ten o clock he told himself that by Monday at noon if nothing unforeseen happened the case would be safely mounted in Mr Jackson s dining room And so it was It was finished at eight o clock and Oscar who was a good judge of such matters declared with no little satisfaction that he had never seen a finer piece of work There was one thing about it that did not look just right and the boy wondered what Mr Jackson would say when he saw it The wheelbarrow was again brought into requisition and the case having been placed upon it and covered with a sheet to protect it from the dust Oscar trundled it off toward Mr Jackson s house His pull at the bell was answered by that gentleman himself who not being an early riser had not yet eaten his breakfast He assisted Oscar to carry the case through the hall and place it upon the little side table on which it was to stand and when the sheet had been removed he stood off and looked at it critically Then he called Miles and all the rest of his family in to pass judgment upon it It is just what I wanted Oscar said Mr Jackson at length and you could not improve it in any way It is splendid and I am entirely satisfied Hold on here what s this He walked close up to the case and placed his finger on one of the panes of glass opposite a bird in resplendent plumage with a green and purple crest marked with two narrow lines of white That s a very pretty bird continued Mr Jackson but what is he doing up there You wouldn t put any woodcock or snipe in the tree because you said they didn t belong there and now you ve gone and put a duck in it What sort of work is that That bird does belong there said Oscar I shot him out of a tree Mr Jackson was well posted in drugs but he knew nothing of natural history He looked toward Miles for an explanation but as the latter was no better acquainted with birds and their habits than his uncle was he could give him no information I ll take him out of there if you wish me to do so and put a grouse in his place said Oscar Oh no replied Mr Jackson quickly If he belongs there let him stay but I never saw a duck in a tree Sit down and have some coffee with us Thank you sir I had my breakfast three hours ago You did exclaimed Mr Jackson as he followed Oscar through the hall toward the front door Well I never could see any sense in eating during the night You will have the dyspepsia some day if you don t stop it There s your money and good by if you must go Miles he continued as he came back into the dining room where the rest of the family were seated at the table what sort of work would you make of it if you were turned loose in the world as that boy is and had no one to depend on but yourself I am sure I don t know replied Miles I hope I shall never be in that situation So do I said his uncle I hope you will associate with Oscar all you can for his influence and example will help any boy If you hear anything said against his honesty I hope you will have pluck enough to resent it on the spot Oh I don t think that anyone will ever hear another word said about his stealing money exclaimed Miles recalling the exciting interview which he and his friend Sam had had with Mr Smith on the previous Friday Then believing that he ought to give some reason for thinking so he added It wouldn t be safe to slander Oscar for Sam Hynes says he will thrash any fellow who does it He s another good one a little too blunt sometimes but as true as steel observed Mr Jackson I can t quite understand why Oscar put a duck in that tree I believe he has made a mistake and I am going to find out about it And he did While he was on the way to his store he met a tall dignified gentleman who stopped to exchange a few words with him It was Mr Chamberlain the principal of the High School The two men had met on that very street at that very hour and near that same spot every day except Saturdays and Sundays for more than a year The principal was the best educated man in town and a good many hard nuts were brought to him to crack You know everything professor said Mr Jackson after the usual greetings had been exchanged but you never knew of a duck being shot out of a tree did you Certainly was the unexpected answer The wood duck of Audubon commonly called summer duck It is the most beautiful species of the duck family and reflects all the colors of the rainbow It never makes its nest upon the ground but always in some hollow tree that hangs over the water As soon as the young are hatched they throw themselves down into the stream below without the least injury There goes the first bell Good morning Mr Jackson I ve learned something thought the druggist as he continued his walk toward the store Oscar was right when he put that duck in the tree It beats me where that boy found time to pick up so much information about birds and things Meanwhile Oscar with his forty dollars in his pocket was trundling his wheelbarrow merrily over the sidewalk toward home He wanted first to place his money in his mother s hands he thought it would be safer there than in his pocket and then he intended to go down to Mr Peck s boat house after the decoys sail and oars he had left there on Saturday He placed his wheelbarrow in the front yard but when he tried to open the door he found it was locked Mother has gone over to visit some of the neighbors thought he I ll stay here until she comes back I ve got the key of the shop in my pocket and I can find plenty to do there During the time Oscar had worked in the store the shop had not been kept as neat and tidy as it usually was The tools he had found time to use now and then were scattered about over the bench the shavings and dust had accumulated everywhere and it was a good hour s work to straighten up things But it was work that Oscar liked to do and he whistled merrily as he set about it Bugle meanwhile stationing himself in the open door and keeping a close watch over everybody that passed along the street Presently he uttered a loud bay and sprang out into the yard Oscar knowing that somebody was coming hurried to the door to see who it was and discovered the hound following at the heels of a little dried up man who was coming around the house toward the shop It was the same man he and Sam Hynes had found clinging to the rudder of the wrecked sail boat Oscar knew him at once for he still wore Sam s cap on his head Come here Bugle shouted Oscar Don t be afraid of him sir He is friendly even to strangers Good morning exclaimed the visitor I knocked at the front door but no one answered my summons I heard someone whistling however so I made bold to come around here Mother went out while I was absent replied Oscar I am glad to see you again sir and hope you did not suffer any inconvenience from your cold bath on Saturday Will you walk in I have a fire in here I am sorry I can t take you into the house The visitor made no reply whatever He came into the wood shed stopped in front of the door that gave entrance into the shop and said I believe your name is ah is ah He thrust his hand into the inside pocket of his coat and pulled out a small notebook Opening it he began turning over the leaves to find Oscar s name which the miller had given him on Saturday The book was filled with writing and on every page the visitor seemed to find something that he wanted to remember for he stopped to read it over in a half audible tone before turning to the next one Oscar stood there in the door of the shop with the broom in his hand for fully five minutes waiting for him to say something Your name is Oscar Preston said the visitor at length and you are the boy who rendered me a very important service two days ago I am the one who caught you as you were sinking but I never could have brought you into the boat if it hadn t been for Sam Hynes replied Oscar He did not want all the honor himself for the absent Sam who was at that moment puzzling his brains over his Vergil was entitled to a good share of it and Oscar intended that he should have it The visitor however seemed to think that the boy who had kept him from sinking was the one who deserved all the credit and he did not act as though he heard Sam s name mentioned I am greatly indebted to you my young friend he continued and I regret that I cannot reward you as you deserve My name is Potter and I am president of the Yarmouth University I was down the river in search of some specimens of the Fuligula Valisneria which I am told are now and then to be found here Oh that s what he went after is it thought Oscar Well I am no wiser than I was before I don t know what those things are and it is no wonder that Mr Hall and Mr Peck didn t understand him I became bewildered and was obliged to pass the night alone upon an island without food or fire continued the visitor In the morning I attempted to reach the village but the wind overturned the boat and I lost a valuable gun and all the equipments belonging to one of the faculty who had kindly loaned it to me Perhaps it was just as well after all for I was afraid to use it having never fired a gun in my life although I hoped to gain courage enough to discharge it if I saw an opportunity to secure a specimen or two Your name is here he consulted his notebook again Oscar Preston and I am informed that you are an expert taxidermist I am an amateur taxidermist sir answered Oscar I do not claim to be an expert I have a few specimens which I shall be glad to show you if you are interested in such things Will you walk in Oscar deposited his broom in one corner and drew aside the curtain concealing the recess in which his birds and animals were placed The professor entered and instantly seemed to become entirely unconscious of Oscar s presence so engrossed was he with what he saw before him He stopped in front of each bird and talked to it in an undertone and finally he began to speak his words aloud so that Oscar could understand them Ah said he a very fine specimen of the order Rasores family Tetraonid vulgo partridge the Tetrao Umbellus of Linn us and the Bonasia Umbellus of Bonaparte which is incorrect This is a specimen of the order Insessores family Ampelid genus Bombycilla Carolinensis Very finely mounted I should say much better than some of the specimens we have at the university All these hard words were rolled off without the least hesitation and it was evident that the professor had them at his tongue s end Oscar listened in genuine amazement and then seizing a piece of pine board that happened to be lying near him on the bench hastily wrote something upon it with a pencil he drew from his pocket and moved up a little closer to his visitor so that he could catch every word he said Young man said the latter do you know anything about comparative anatomy No sir replied Oscar who had never heard this expression before You ought to study it continued the professor for it belongs to your business If you will give a scientist a single bone he can build the skeleton of the beast or bird to which that bone belongs although he may never have seen it The species may even be extinct Some of my students once brought me a bone they had found in the woods and which they thought was the bone of a mastodon of the order Pachydermata but it proved to belong to one of the order Ruminantia being the bone of an ox Oscar wrote two words more on his board and waited for the professor to go on and when he did go on Oscar heard something for which he was not at all prepared and which astonished him beyond measure I think you are the person we want continued the visitor He stood with his hands behind his back and his spectacles on the end of his nose looking up at the specimens on the shelves and he seemed to be talking more to himself than to Oscar A generous and public spirited citizen of Yarmouth has given to our university a hundred thousand dollars which is to be expended in founding as fine a museum as that amount of money will pay for The birds and animals of our country are to be represented first mounted in a life like manner and looking if possible as natural as they do in their wild haunts Those of other countries are to be taken in hand afterward We have already gathered a few specimens though in a desultory way and some of them are declared by experts to be very imperfect Of the order Ruminantia family Cervid we have obtained but one species the Cervus Virginianus Oscar wrote these words on his board He could easily do it for his visitor did not seem to be paying the least attention to him We have the Alces Americanus and the Cervus Tarandus as well as the hollow horned ruminants of which there is but one species in this country as you are no doubt aware yet to procure Of the Digitigrades family Canid we have but one the red fox We should be willing to give something handsome for a gray cross or black fox Of the Plantigrades we have two Ursus Americanus and Procyon lotor We should like a specimen of the Ursus horribilis and the Ursus maritimus and also of the cinnamon bear which seems to be gaining some notoriety for voracity and fierceness but I don t suppose that a boy of your years would care to face animals of that description We have been trying to engage an accomplished taxidermist who is at the same time a successful hunter to work for us for a term of years at a stated salary but thus far we have not succeeded in our object for the reason that those to whom we have applied demand more money than the committee in whose hands the matter is placed think they can afford to pay We are quite willing to give a hundred dollars a month and expenses provided the collector is willing to go where we want to send him but more than that we could not promise under the terms on which the money was given to us Ah here s a Digitigrade he exclaimed when he discovered the fox which was one of Oscar s first specimens Now if you think you can afford to work for us for that amount of money we shall be glad to employ you I know that the committee will indorse any bargain I may make with you but in order to make assurance doubly sure perhaps I had better consult with them before we come to any definite understanding Oscar had stood with his board in one hand and his pencil in the other ready to note down as many of the visitor s hard words as he could catch but while he listened his hands gradually fell until they rested by his side and when the professor ceased speaking he backed up against his work bench and leaned heavily upon it The astounding offer of a hundred dollars a month and expenses almost knocked him over CHAPTER XI MR SMITH MAKES AMENDS You are not engaged in any regular occupation now I believe continued the professor No sir I am not answered Oscar as soon as he could speak Then I suggest that you keep yourself at liberty until you hear from some of us I shall return to the city by the first train and as soon as I can see the committee our secretary will drop you a line I am confident that I can put you in the way of making a name and a living for yourself Good morning The professor disappeared through the door and Oscar having seen him close the gate behind him drew a long breath thrust his hands deep into his pockets and walked up and down the shop thinking over what had transpired He was so highly excited that he could not have kept still to save his life It hardly seemed possible that the art of taxidermy which he had taken up simply as a recreation should be the means of making him rich and famous and he could not bring himself to believe that such was the fact There was one thing that stood in his way Everybody who came in contact with his late visitor seemed to think that there was something wrong with him and Oscar himself had seen and heard enough to prove that the professor was a very strange man Perhaps his name wasn t Potter and perhaps too he had no connection whatever with the Yarmouth University I ll not build any hopes upon it said the boy as these thoughts passed through his mind and neither will I say a word to mother when she comes home She would be very much disappointed if it turned out to be a hoax and I don t see how she can stand any more trouble Sam will be around some time to day most likely and I ll ask him what he thinks about it He has good sound sense and besides he knows how to keep a secret Oscar picked up his broom again but very soon found that he had lost interest in everything except Professor Potter and his astonishing proposition He could not keep his mind on anything else nor could he calm his excitement and believing that a brisk walk in the open air would be more agreeable than working in the dusty shop he locked the door picked up his wheelbarrow as he passed through the yard and set out for Mr Peck s boat house Bugle leading the way He found his decoys sail and oars where he had left them and having packed them away in his wheelbarrow he turned his face toward home As he was passing across the park he heard someone calling to him He stopped and looking across the street saw Mr Anderson running toward him and beckoning with his hand What does he want I wonder thought the boy I don t care to see him but if he wants to see me he can come where I am He set down the wheelbarrow and taking his seat on one of the handles looked at Mr Anderson who stopped in the middle of the street and waved his hand to him Come over here he shouted I can t see it said Oscar to himself I have been insulted in that store once and I never want to see the inside of it again If he has anything to say to me we ll have the interview right here for this is neutral ground Oscar kept his seat on the wheelbarrow and resting his elbows on his knees looked up and down the street in an indifferent sort of way as if he meant to show that Mr Anderson and his movements did not interest him in the least The junior partner finding that the boy paid no attention to his words and signals came across the street and hurried up to him Our hero was astonished at his greeting He thrust out his hand and Oscar placed his own within it I am glad to see you again said Mr Anderson cheerfully It looks natural to see you around Come over to the store Mr Smith has something very particular to say to you I guess I had better not go replied Oscar I am not in your employ now and I may say something I shall be sorry for No you won t for the opportunity will not be given you exclaimed Mr Anderson earnestly You ll have no cause for saying hard things Be guided by me just this once and come in You will never regret it Oscar took a few minutes in which to think about it Finally he arose to his feet and pushing his wheelbarrow off the walk out of the way he followed the junior partner across the street and into the store When they entered the office Mr Anderson closed and locked the door Mr Smith occupied his usual place on his high stool but he scrambled down from it with great haste and gave his former clerk a most cordial welcome Oscar said he I find that I have done you very great injustice and I am sorry for it The boy s face relaxed on the instant Knowing Mr Smith as well as he did he had never expected him to make such a confession as this Then perhaps you wouldn t mind telling me why I was discharged and why you refused to give me the letter of recommendation for which I asked said Oscar Mr Smith cleared his throat two or three times and climbed back to his high stool again It was hard work for him to answer that question and when he met the gaze of the clear honest eyes that were looking straight into his own he wondered how he could ever have suspected their owner of being a thief Well the amount of it is that somebody has been robbing our till systematically said he when he had mustered up courage enough to give utterance to the words All our clerks except you had been with us for a long term of years We had the utmost confidence in their honesty and and And you suspected me exclaimed Oscar his face reddening with indignation Well yes that s the plain English of it But we have since found out that we made a woeful mistake The guilty one has been discovered and has made a full confession in which he took particular pains to clear you of all suspicion Now we are anxious to make all the amends in our power Do you want to come back here at thirty dollars a month No sir replied Oscar promptly The two grocers seemed very much surprised at this answer They looked at each other and at Oscar as if they were waiting for him to say something more but as he did not speak Mr Smith continued Then we ll say thirty five and that is almost double the amount we paid you before I am very much obliged to you but I cannot accept the offer answered Oscar You do not bear us any ill will I hope said Mr Anderson None whatever I assure you I am overjoyed to know that you no longer believe me to be dishonest and I shall think of you with as kindly feelings as I ever did but I can t come back to the store for I have something better in prospect For your sake I am very glad to hear it for my own I am sorry said Mr Smith and the words came from his heart If the time ever comes when we can advance your interests in any way do not hesitate to call upon us You are at perfect liberty to use the firm s name whenever it will be of benefit to you We know you to be an honest capable boy and we shall take pleasure in recommending you as such I am greatly obliged to you sir and I may some day be glad to take advantage of your kind offer Now I will bid you good by Just one word more Oscar said Mr Anderson as the boy laid his hand upon the door knob if you don t secure that better thing of which you were speaking remember that your old position is open to you At thirty five dollars a month chimed in Mr Smith Thank you I ll bear it in mind Oscar s excitement which had been worked up to almost fever heat by the conversation he had had with the professor in his work shop that morning was greatly increased by this interview but still he managed to keep a few of his wits about him and when he passed out into the store he ran his eyes hastily around to see if any of the clerks were missing They were all there except one I m glad to see you Oscar cried Hudson the oldest clerk in the store You look as happy as a clam Coming back It is hardly probable was the reply Where s Stuart Stuart has been sick in bed ever since Friday something like brain fever I think answered Hudson He works here yet I suppose Oh yes he ll be back as soon as he gets well And I ll tell you something Preston which surprised me when I first found it out Mr Smith s got a heart I heard him say that Stuart s wages would go right on It is very strange thought Oscar as he closed the door behind him None of the clerks have been discharged so the till tapper whoever he is must still be in the store I was dismissed when there was not the least proof against me and now a confessed thief is allowed to retain his situation I don t see much justice in that Well perhaps the guilty fellow is one of their trusted men and Smith Anderson don t want to make any stir about it Morning Oscar exclaimed the post office clerk who just then hurried by with his face buried in the collar of his overcoat Letter in your box Oscar thanking him for the information turned down the street and crossed over to the post office and all the while he seemed to be treading on air so light and buoyant were his spirits He had heard good news from two sources that forenoon and there was something else agreeable in store for him as he found when the letter was placed in his hands It proved to be from Calkins Son who acknowledged the receipt in good order of the eighteen brace of ducks that had been sent to them on Saturday asked for a shipment of grouse quails or hares at once and enclosed their check for made payable to Oscar s order After reading the letter he put it into his pocket seized the wheelbarrow which now seemed as light as a feather and trundled it home in much less time than he had ever consumed in making the journey before He let himself into the shop and while he was busy putting away his decoys a lively whistle sounded in the yard and Sam Hynes came rushing in O Sam exclaimed Oscar Hallo What s the matter with you demanded the visitor who saw that his friend was greatly excited about something I ve had the best luck in the world to day answered Oscar In the first place the fellow who got me into all that trouble with Smith Anderson has been discovered and has made a full confession No cried Sam opening his eyes and looking very much surprised It s a fact Mr Smith informed me not an hour ago that he had done me great injustice and he was sorry for it You don t tell me so cried Sam seating himself on the bench and looking the very picture of amazement and delight Who was the guilty rascal I don t know and I couldn t find out I didn t ask Mr Smith and he didn t volunteer the information The clerks were busy in the store to day and they were all there except Stuart He is ill and will come back as soon as he gets well so the thief whoever he is still holds his position Sam was really astonished now and the delight he feigned became genuine when Oscar continued Mr Smith told me that my old situation was open to me at thirty five dollars a month Good exclaimed Sam jumping off the bench and extending his hand When do you go back I am not going back at all I have something better Sam opened his eyes again and listened attentively while Oscar went on to describe the interview he had had with Professor Potter and to tell him of the liberal offer the latter had made him He did not forget to inform his friend that the professor still wore his Sam s cap on his head and that he had probably carried it to the city with him As Oscar proceeded with his story the look of astonishment on Sam s face gradually gave way to an altogether different expression and when Oscar ceased speaking he seated himself on the bench again and gazed down at the floor in a brown study Now then what s the matter with you demanded Oscar If I answer your question at all I shall say just what I think replied Sam That is what I want you to do Speak out I will You have missed it If you are wise you will lose no time in telling Mr Smith that you will take those thirty five dollars a month But Sam I can t do it I promised the professor that I would keep myself free until I heard from him Professor exclaimed Sam with great disgust He is about as much a professor as I am If you had heard him talk this morning you wouldn t think so I tell you he is educated That may be but a man who will go on as he did when we pulled him out of the water and who hasn t sense enough to know when he is wearing a cap belonging to somebody else can t have much wit Professor He never saw Yarmouth University and you ll never hear from him again either What have you got there added Sam glancing at a piece of wood which his companion just then took from the work bench I wrote down some of his hard words replied Oscar passing the board over to Sam You are fresh from your books and I d like to have you translate them for me I ll tell you what s a fact I have come to the conclusion that I don t know anything about natural history He talked in a regular scientific style didn t he said Sam after he had run his eyes over the board The animal kingdom as you know is divided into branches classes orders families genera and species The branch Vertebrates is divided into five classes fishes batrachians reptiles birds and mammalia The class birds is divided into seven orders two of which you have put down here The Rasores are scratchers such as the turkey and grouse and the Insessores are perchers To this order belong all our songbirds Well he went down the river after some specimens of the Fuligula Valisneria said Oscar What are they That s a conundrum replied Sam What s a Bombycilla Carolinensis I give it up There are only a few words more here that I can understand and Oscar I ll say this much for you your spelling is simply fearful The Pachydermata are thick skinned animals such as the elephant and rhinoceros the Ruminantia are those that chew the cud like the cow and sheep the Digitigrades walk on their toes the cat and dog belong to this family and the Plantigrades walk on their heels To this family the bear belongs That is as far as I can help you But I ll tell you what we will do added Sam jumping down from the bench and pulling out his watch I ll be around here to night within fifteen minutes after school is dismissed and you go home and take supper with me In the early part of the evening I ll beat you playing a game of chess and then we ll go over and call on Mr Chamberlain He will make everything clear to you I don t believe you have been near him since you left school No I haven t answered Oscar I was obliged to neglect everybody while I was in the store I ll be ready for you Sam rushed out slamming the door behind him and hurried toward the gate but just then Oscar happened to think of something so he ran to the door and called him back CHAPTER XII AN EVENING WITH THE PRINCIPAL I will detain you but a moment Sam exclaimed Oscar I have received a check from Calkins Son for to pay for the ducks we killed on Saturday Good for Calkins Son replied Sam If they are always as prompt as that they are the men we want to deal with Half of it belongs to you you know Yes I know it answered Sam once more turning his face toward the gate You act as my banker and when I want my share I ll make out a draft for it Hold on Sam shouted Oscar who knew very well what this meant I ll do nothing of the kind Oscar you are the most stubborn fellow I ever had anything to do with said Sam shaking his finger at his friend and utterly ignoring the fact that he had never been known to give up to Oscar in a single instance I never saw so obstinate a boy you want your own way all the time Now put that check in your pocket and keep it there If it is too much trouble for you to do that give it to the poor Good by and be ready for me at a quarter past four Sam turned down the street and set off at a rapid trot He had just time enough left to eat his dinner and reach the school house before the last bell rang If there is a confiding fellow in the world it is that Oscar Preston said he to himself as he ran along That crazy man has bamboozled him completely I was sorry to dash all his bright hopes to the ground but I thought he ought to be waked up to the real facts of the case I never saw a boy look so sorrowful and downhearted as he did when I told him what I thought about it I wish from the bottom of my heart it was an offer he could depend on Wouldn t he be in clover though A hundred dollars a month and expenses for travelling about the country shooting birds and animals Just think of it Oscar watched his friend as long as he remained in sight and then leaning his elbows on the work bench he rested his chin upon his hands and looked thoughtfully out of the window toward the evergreen screen behind the house He was by no means as cheerful and hopeful as he had been a short half hour before His crony s visit had depressed his spirits wonderfully but Sam was not to blame for that He had asked him what he thought of the president s proposition and Sam as he always did had answered his question promptly and in language that could not possibly be misunderstood Perhaps Sam was right and he would never again hear of the man who had called himself President Potter Oscar had resolved more than once that day that he would not build any hopes upon the offer he had received but in spite of all his efforts his thoughts would dwell upon it and every little while he found himself indulging in some rosy dreams of the future Would it not be a good plan to take Sam s advice and tell Mr Smith that he would go back to the store for the wages he had of his own free will offered to give him The thirty five dollars a month he was sure of the larger sum he was not sure of While he was thinking about it his mother came to the door and called him to dinner The first thing Oscar did when he entered the dining room was to place in his mother s hands the money he had been paid by Mr Jackson and the check he had received from Calkins Son but he said not a word to her regarding the interviews he had held with Professor Potter and Mr Smith He could not describe these interviews without telling of the propositions that had been made him and he did not want to do that until he had determined upon something He wanted time to look at the matter from every possible standpoint and he found ample opportunity to do it that afternoon for he spent very little time in work He went back to the shop as soon as he had eaten his dinner but he could find nothing there to interest him He finished sweeping out and rearranged his specimens on the shelves but it was all done by snatches He would work a few minutes and then he would walk up and down the shop with his eyes fastened upon the floor When four o clock came his chores were all done and having exchanged his working clothes for a neat business suit he was ready to accompany Sam to his home where he passed a few hours in the most agreeable manner Everybody who visited there said that Mr Hynes s house was one of the pleasantest and happiest in Eaton and Oscar had always found it so It was just the place to go when one was troubled with the blues as our hero had been all that afternoon Sam s father and mother were very jolly people and his sister besides being a fine singer and pianist played chess so well that Oscar who was sometimes given to boasting of his own skill was often badly worsted Seven o clock came almost before the boys knew it and then they put on their caps and set out to visit the principal of the High School Ringing the bell at his door they were ushered into the library where Mr Chamberlain sat with his slippered feet on the fender and the evening s paper in his hand He greeted Oscar very cordially for the latter had been one of his favorite pupils He had never been known to break one of the rules of school and had never been reprimanded He went to school to learn and for no other purpose Do you know such a boy If you do you know one whom all his teachers like I am glad to see you again Oscar said Mr Chamberlain as he shook his visitors warmly by the hand and placed chairs for them and I must congratulate you on your good fortune I knew it would come after awhile Thank you sir replied Oscar wondering how the gentleman had heard of it It never does any good to allow ourselves to get discouraged continued Mr Chamberlain sinking back into his easy chair It is always darkest just before daylight you know I must say that I am surprised as well as delighted So am I sir returned Oscar I never expected that he would make an acknowledgment even though he received the most positive proof that he had been mistaken Acknowledgment repeated Mr Chamberlain Who made any acknowledgment What are you talking about Oscar Why I thought you referred to what passed between Mr Smith and myself to day replied the boy I hadn t heard anything about that Has Mr Smith found out that he did you injustice I am glad of it said Mr Chamberlain upon receiving an affirmative nod from Sam I knew that would come too You may have the satisfaction of knowing that not a single one of your friends ever believed anything wrong against you I may also say he added with a smile looking toward Sam who blushed to the roots of his hair that some of your acquaintances hold very strong opinions on that point and that those opinions have been enforced with the aid of a ball club But I was speaking of the offer you received from President Potter He called on you this morning did he not Do you know him Mr Chamberlain exclaimed Sam Certainly I do He was my old preceptor and my guest while he was in Eaton But is he really president of the Yarmouth University He certainly is What else did you take him for I took him for a crazy man replied Sam bluntly A crazy man Sam I am surprised at you Well now Mr Chamberlain if you had been in our boat and had heard him talk when we pulled him out of the water you would have thought so yourself if you had been a stranger to him With this introduction Sam went on to repeat the speech the professor had made while he was lying on the bottom of Oscar s skiff He had paid particular attention to it and could recall it word for word That is just like him said Mr Chamberlain If he were lecturing a class in this room to night and the house should catch fire he wouldn t leave off until the smoke or flames drove him out He becomes so completely absorbed in his subject that he doesn t seem to hear or see anything and I have known mischievous students to steal out of the class room one after another until there were not more than three or four left and he never missed them If I had not called his attention to the fact that he had Sam s cap on his head he would have worn it to Yarmouth when he went away this afternoon Sam you will find the article in question on the hat rack when you go home I d like to ask one question before I forget it said Oscar Is it possible that there are men who by looking at a single bone can give you the name of the beast or bird to which that bone belongs Mr Potter told me to day that some of his students once brought him a bone they had found in the woods and which they supposed to be the bone of a mastodon but it proved to be the bone of an ox Mr Chamberlain leaned his head against the back of his chair looked up at the ceiling and laughed until his eyes were filled with tears I wonder if the professor still remembers that little incident said he If my memory serves me I used to be pretty well acquainted with that same student He knew very well that the bone did not belong to a mastodon but he thought he would test the old gentleman s knowledge It is hardly necessary to say that he was entirely satisfied with the result of the experiment and had the laugh turned on him completely by the other students who were in the plot There was something in Mr Chamberlain s tone that made the two boys smile at each other They believed that if the principal had given the name of that student he would have given one that sounded very much like his own name The professor told me to day that he had offered you a hundred dollars a month and all expenses to procure specimens for the university museum continued Mr Chamberlain addressing himself to Oscar and you may rest assured that you will get it Mr Potter has a hundred thousand dollars to spend in that way and I see no reason why you should not earn a good portion of it You have a number of years of steady employment before you at more than living wages if you are inclined to accept this offer The boys listened to these words with the greatest amazement and it is hard to tell which of the two was the more delighted thereat Sam was overjoyed to learn that he had been mistaken in the opinions he had formed and could hardly refrain from jumping up and tossing his cap into the air As for Oscar he blessed his lucky stars that he had not accepted Mr Smith s offer as he had more than once been tempted to do that afternoon Mr Chamberlain said Sam as soon as he had controlled his excitement so that he could talk intelligibly what is a a where s that list Oscar The latter produced a piece of paper on which he had copied the hard words he had written on his pine board that morning that is all that Sam had not been able to translate for him and handed it to his companion who passed it over to the principal Mr Chamberlain glanced at the first words on the list and shook his head Perhaps I haven t spelled them correctly observed Oscar They are the things the professor went down the river after on Saturday chimed in Sam Oh the Fuligula Valisneria exclaimed Mr Chamberlain That is the canvas back duck Ah said both boys in concert The family Canid is the dog family said Mr Chamberlain turning again to the list The family Tetraonid is the grouse family and Tetra Umbellus is the ruffed grouse which almost everybody calls a partridge In the South the quail is called a partridge and the grouse is called a pheasant I hope you boys will never allow yourselves to fall into such habits You can t begin too early in life to call things by their right names To the family Ampelid belong the chatterers Bombycilla Carolinensis is the cedar bird The Cervid comprise the deer family and Cervus Virginianus is our common red deer the hollow horned ruminants are the antelopes There is only one species in the United States and that is the pronghorn of our Western plains If you should go out there to hunt him you would see no end of sport Oscar and I suppose no end of hard times I hope you will not expect to find it all plain sailing simply because you have stepped into an agreeable and profitable situation Ursus Americanus is the American black bear Ursus horribilis you mustn t have anything to do with him that s the grizzly bear the most dangerous and dreaded animal in the country Ursus maritimus that s the polar bear is almost as bad The names on that list include the animals they want in their museum said Sam and Oscar will be obliged to hunt them if they tell him to do so Would you dare do it asked Mr Chamberlain looking at Oscar I don t know sir My courage has never been put to the test But I will say this If they will give me a chance to work around home until I can earn money enough to support my mother while I m gone I ll start for the plains or for Africa within twenty four hours after I receive their order I like that spirit said Mr Chamberlain If you are going into a thing go into it as though you were alive and wide awake By the way The principal laid down the list and arose to his feet Opening his bookcase he took from it two large and finely bound volumes which he placed upon the table at Oscar s elbow When you go home take these books with you said he Keep them as long as they are of any use to you and they will tell you everything you want to know about birds and animals scientific names and all I have the best of reasons for saying that you will be summoned to Yarmouth in the course of a few days to pass a sort of examination before the committee and I want you to acquit yourself with honor so if I were in your place I would spend all my spare time in cramming CHAPTER XIII THE BLACK FOX Oscar thanked the principal warmly for his advice and for the interest he took in his affairs and just then the little clock on the mantle chimed the hour of nine The boys having promised to be at their respective homes by that time bade Mr Chamberlain good night and hurried out Sam taking possession of his cap as he passed through the hall What do you think of the situation now inquired Oscar when the gate had been closed behind them Sam stopped and by way of reply seized his companion s hand giving it a grip and a shake that would have made almost any other boy double up with pain I never wanted to yell so badly in my life as I did when Mr Chamberlain told us that that crazy man was just what he represented himself to be said Sam I ll hold in until we have our next practice game of ball or until you and I go down the river again and then won t I make things ring Say Oscar when you are knocking over that big game right and left you ll think of a fellow won t you Indeed I will Sam How much I wish you could go with me if I go Oh you ll go you need have no fears on that score exclaimed Sam with great enthusiasm I should like to be hanging on to the sleeve of your jacket about the time you catch sight of your first antelope but it isn t to be thought of I must be in Harvard by a year from next fall if I have brains enough to get there Father has set his heart upon it and as he is the very best father any boy ever had I wouldn t disappoint him for the world Of course not said Oscar Now Sam I want to ask you a question What have you been doing Nothing nothing whatever said his companion promptly I have read somewhere Oscar that the way those fellows on the plains hunt the pronghorn is to That won t do Sam interrupted Oscar I want to talk about another matter You have been hitting somebody with a ball club No I haven t honor bright exclaimed Sam with a great show of earnestness I never in my life hit anything with a ball club except the ball and the home base Why man alive I d be afraid to do it The boys had by this time reached Sam s home which was but a few steps from Mr Chamberlain s house As Sam was about to open the gate Oscar shut it with a bang and placed his back against it After that he put his books upon the top of the gate post and stood ready to resist any attempt his companion might make to pull him away from his position Hallo here cried Sam with well feigned astonishment What do you mean by that performance Won t you let me go in No sir I won t not unless you can pull me away from here and I don t know whether you can do that or not I don t either replied Sam backing off and putting his hands in his pockets so I ll not try But it is after nine o clock and I ought to be in bed and fast asleep Some of the folks might come out here to look for me I know they might but they won t Now what have you been doing with that ball club I know you have been up to something for your face got as red as a beet when Mr Chamberlain spoke about it I never saw so obstinate and persistent a fellow as you are when you once get your mind set on a thing said Sam leaning his elbow on the fence and trying to look like a boy who was very badly persecuted I punched him with it if you must know There I told you that you had been hitting somebody But I say I didn t hit him protested Sam I only poked him in the ribs with the end of it Him Who Leon Parker And got yourself into trouble by it for Mr Chamberlain kept you after school and gave you a good talking to Well I guess that was about the way of it said Sam reflectively What did you poke him in the ribs for Because he had too much to say about well he had too much to say Look here Sam said Oscar stepping up and laying his hand upon his companion s shoulder I am proud of your friendship and I know it will continue as long as you and I live I wouldn t say or do anything to hurt your feelings and I wish you would be equally careful of mine Now don t get yourself into trouble for me any more Oh it wasn t the least trouble in the world answered Sam purposely ignoring Oscar s meaning he thought his friend was becoming altogether too serious I poked him just as easy and I never hurt him a bit either Oscar was obliged to laugh in spite of himself Well promise me that you won t poke any more boys in the ribs with ball clubs because they talk about me for I know that was what Leon did said he I promise I ll never do it again assured Sam earnestly And whatever you do don t touch Leon Parker continued Oscar I owe a great deal to his father and I wouldn t have Leon hurt for anything He hasn t injured me by his talking and neither has anybody for not one of those whose friendship I prize has turned against me That s so assented Sam Well I suppose I must say good night Shall we take another trip down the river next Saturday I ll tell you what I d like to do replied Oscar I d like to make an effort to recover the gun the professor lost when his boat upset He said it was a borrowed piece and a very valuable one too I am with you We ll take the decoys along and then if the ducks happen to come our way we shall be all ready for them Good night I think I was quite safe in saying that I wouldn t trouble Leon anymore said Sam as he opened the front door and entered the house for the lesson I gave him a few days ago will teach him that he had better keep his slanderous tongue still A ball club is a pretty hard thing to push against a fellow s ribs that s a fact and I ll not do it any more I ll use my fist next time If Oscar had overheard this soliloquy he would have been compelled to acknowledge that he had not gained much by the promise he had extorted from his friend Sam The young taxidermist walked homeward with a light heart There was nothing now to prevent him from taking his mother into his confidence which he proceeded to do as soon as he had entered the house Mrs Preston listened attentively to his story and when it was finished she said with something like a sigh If that committee should decide to send you away from Eaton I should be very lonely for you are all I have now but if you and Mr Chamberlain think it is to your interest to accept this offer I have nothing to say against it I shall not throw a single obstacle in your way The boy was overjoyed to hear this He had been afraid that his mother might not be quite so well pleased with his prospects as he was and it would have been a sore disappointment if she had raised any objections to the plans he had determined upon Oscar did not settle down into a state of chronic inactivity as many boys would have done who had a clear hundred dollars a month in prospect Money was needed at once to pay part of the principal and all the interest that was due Mr Simpson and Oscar went manfully to work to earn it in the only way that was open to him He spent four days of that week in the woods with Bugle and every night a good sized bunch of grouse quails and hares was shipped to Calkins Son who on every second day sent him a check for his money The young hunter had never known game to be so abundant as it was that year and it was no more trouble for him to secure it than it would have been to sit in the house and do nothing He read and studied diligently every evening and made regular visits to the post office hoping to find there the letter the professor had promised to write him but it did not come When Friday afternoon arrived Oscar walked down to Mr Simpson s office and paid him one hundred dollars on the mortgage and thirty dollars for interest at six per cent He felt better after that and told himself that the old sharper s chances for gaining possession of his mother s house and lot were by no means as good as they had been As he was about to enter the gate he found the farmer who supplied his mother with wood just driving out of the yard Howdy Oscar exclaimed the man drawing up his team with a jerk Folks say you know all about varmints and things and I d like to have you tell me if a black fox is wuth more n any other kind I should say he was answered Oscar Have you got one Got him No I aint and that there is just what s the matter of me and my hens He won t leave one of em that there feller won t if you and Bugle don t come up to my house and shoot him We aint got no dogs wuth their salt and my boys can t somehow do nothing with him They ve tuk after him a time or two but laws they can t somehow get him to stick his foot into a trap nuther cause he s smarter than chain lightnin that there fox is Oscar became interested at once He was always on the lookout for such chances as this for they gave him an opportunity to try his skill and Bugle s He knew there were many good hunters and dogs in the farmer s neighborhood and an animal that could outwit them all must be cunning indeed And then he was a black fox Oscar remembered hearing the professor say that he would be willing to give something handsome for one of that species Have you ever seen him Mr Bacon he asked Seen him every morning fur a hull week was the reply and shot at him a time or two but laws he s blacker n that there nigh hoss of mine that fox is all except the tip end of his tail and that s whiter n snow He must be a beauty exclaimed Oscar I wish I had him Well come up there and shoot him you and Bugle why don t you Save the rest of my hens by knocking that there feller over and I ll give you as good a dinner as you ever eat in a farmhouse I ll try him on Monday if nothing happens to keep me at home but if he can get away from such hunters as I know your boys to be no doubt he will get away from me too Do you know anything about his runways What s them asked Mr Bacon Why a fox has regular courses which he always follows when he is started by a hound and they are just as plain to him and to a hunter who knows the country and understands the habits of the animal as this road is to you Those courses are called runways You can t keep up with a fox when he is running before the dogs and so you must get ahead of him and shoot him as he passes along one of these runways Mebbe there s sunthin in that there idee of your n said Mr Bacon after reflecting a moment I have always noticed that fox when he crosses from one side of the holler to the other takes to my medder and jumps the brook about thirty yards below that bridge in my lane The dogs always start him on that sugar loaf hill east of my house I reckin he s got a den up there and when he gets tired of foolin around that hill he crosses over to the west side of the holler jumpin the brook where I told you and that s the end of the hunt for them wuthless dogs of our n can t never find that fox agin that day I thank you for the information replied Oscar You have given me a start and I can find out the rest for myself All right Don t you forget to come up to my house and get sunthin to eat Mr Bacon cracked his whip and drove off and Oscar went into the house He put the string out of his window before he went to bed and at an early hour Sam awoke him by upsetting the chair Everything was ready for the start and as soon as Oscar had made a cup of coffee and a hasty breakfast had been disposed of the boys set out for the river As before they took the wheelbarrow with them and this time it contained in addition to the decoys sail and oars an iron drag with four long curved teeth which Oscar had ordered made at the blacksmith s This drag was made fast to a strong rope forty feet in length and was to be used in recovering the gun the professor had lost in the river just a week before The boys could not have wished for better luck than they had that day They shot several ducks on their way down the river and when they arrived off the head of Squaw Island and had made up their minds where it was that the professor s boat had been capsized Sam who sat in the stern threw the drag overboard while Oscar pulled the skiff about in circles The water was only about twenty feet deep the boys wished the weather was warmer so that they could dive for the lost fowling piece and the bottom was composed of smooth flat rocks over which the sharp teeth of the drag passed almost as easily as they would have passed over a floor Of course they would catch hold of something occasionally and stop the progress of the boat and then Sam would overhaul the rope very carefully only to find when the drag came to the surface that there was nothing on it At the third cast however his efforts were rewarded The drag struck against some object that offered but a very feeble resistance as Sam tugged at the rope He hauled in slowly and cautiously and in a few seconds brought to light the missing gun suspended by its trigger guard from one of the teeth of the drag Sam greeted it with a series of frightful yells flourishing it in triumph over his head then rubbed it briskly with an oiled rag which he drew from his game bag all the while making running comments upon the general appearance of the weapon and finally he passed it over to his companion Isn t it a beauty cried Oscar holding it off at arm s length and giving it a good looking over If it shoots as well as it looks it is certainly a valuable gun We have saved somebody a hundred and fifty dollars Yes and more remarked Sam It was made by Joe Manton the fashionable gun maker of England you can see his name on the barrels and never cost a cent less than three hundred When Oscar had admired the gun to his heart s content he picked up the oars again and pulled toward the island There were still a powder flask and shot pouch somewhere on the bottom of the river the professor had told Oscar that with the gun he had lost all the equipments but these articles could be replaced for so little money and the chances of picking them up with the drag were so few and far between that the boys did not think it worth while to waste time in looking for them They had recovered the gun and the owner would certainly be satisfied with that CHAPTER XIV WHO DESTROYED THE SNARES Arriving at the head of the island the decoys were set out and the boys took their positions behind the blind where they remained until three o clock that afternoon The shooting was all they could desire and when they returned home that night Oscar had thirty one and a half brace of ducks to ship to the city after Sam had taken out all he wanted for his own use The extra duck Oscar carried home for his next day s dinner and the others were duly forwarded to Calkins Son The first thing Oscar did after he had eaten his supper was to take the recovered shot gun into his shop and give it a thorough overhauling The loads were drawn Oscar laughed when he saw how small they were they would scarcely have ruffled the feathers of a mallard at ten paces the breech pins were unscrewed the locks taken to pieces and every part was oiled and rubbed until it shone like silver He worked upon it until ten o clock and when he put it together again no one would have supposed that it had lain for a whole week at the bottom of the river It could not have been in better order when it first came from the hands of the man who made it Oscar was up long before daylight on Monday morning and having eaten breakfast he set out with his gun on his shoulder and Bugle at his heels to try his luck with the black fox Now Reynard be on the alert Bring all your cunning into play and make use of every artifice known to you for you have no tyros to deal with to day Mr Bacon s farm was eight miles from the village by the road but by following a short cut across the hills three miles of this distance could be saved Of course Oscar took the nearer way for his experience had taught him that in foxhunting when one is sometimes obliged to run a mile or two through a thick wood in order to reach a runway before the game passes every step counts Bugle much to his disgust was kept at heel all the way for his master s heart was set upon securing a black fox and he had no time to waste with hares grouse or common red foxes Just as the sun was rising the young hunter came to a standstill upon the brink of a high bluff and saw below him the hollow in which Mr Bacon s farm was situated He had no difficulty in finding the sugar loaf hill for he knew right where to look for it When he reached it the hound was ordered to hunt em up and he was only too glad to do it He disappeared in the bushes while Oscar climbed slowly up the hill for a short distance and walked leisurely around it in a direction opposite to that taken by the dog Finally as he did not hear from Bugle he stopped in a little open space where he could command a view of an acre or two of the hillside and sat down to rest and await developments Ten minutes passed and then a long drawn bay which was so faint and far off that it was scarcely audible and which was repeated by the echoes until it seemed to sound from the hills on the other side of the hollow came to his ears whereupon Oscar arose to his feet placed his back against a tree and cocking both barrels of his gun held the weapon across his breast in such a position that it could be brought to his shoulder in an instant He did not get behind the tree and look around it for he knew that if he did he would surely be discovered by the fox should he chance to come that way He stood out in plain sight and that was the proper thing to do The hill proved to be a great deal larger than Oscar thought it was for more than an hour passed before Bugle came around to him but that he had struck a trail and a warm one too was evident judging by the way he gave tongue At last his deep toned bays began to ring out louder and clearer and then Oscar brought his gun to his shoulder and standing as motionless as a figure carved out of stone kept his eye moving about the clear space below him but the fox did not break cover He must have passed that way however for in a few minutes more Bugle dashed around the base of the hill giving tongue at every jump and started for another hour s run around the sugar loaf As soon as he was out of hearing Oscar put down the hammers of his gun and ran across the open space at the top of his speed I was on the right track thought he but not quite far enough down the hill Now I wish I knew where that fellow turns off when he makes up his mind to cross the hollow and go over to the hill on the other side Ah Here is where he passed If he tries that trick again he is my fox The exclamations were called forth by the discovery of a well beaten path which ran diagonally toward the summit of the hill A short examination of it showed the hunter that it had been made by Mr Bacon s sheep and his experience told him that the fox had followed that path in the hope of throwing off the hound Crossing newly ploughed fields where the scent will not lie walking on the top rail of fences wading in shallow brooks and running about among a flock of sheep or following a road along which they have recently passed are stratagems to which a cunning old fox will frequently resort to throw off the dogs that are pursuing his trail but Bugle was much too smart to be deceived by any such tricks and he had followed the fox up the path without the least trouble Being fully satisfied that he had found the right place at last Oscar stationed himself in front of a large tree that stood a short distance up the path and in such a position that he could look over the tops of the bushes that surrounded it and command a view of the trail for twenty yards on each side and patiently waited for Bugle to drive the fox around to him again It was a long time before he heard from the hound longer than before and then he heard but a few faint bays after which all was silent again The fox had left the sugar loaf and taken to another hill standing half a mile further down the hollow After playing around there for half an hour he came back to the hill he had left and started around it in a direction opposite to that he had at first followed Oscar s ears told him all this he could distinctly hear the hound whenever he rounded the base of the hill nearest the hollow and he prepared to act accordingly He moved a little further around his tree and keeping his gaze directed up the path cocked both barrels of his gun and drew it to his shoulder He had not occupied this position more than five minutes before the fox came in sight It was the one he was looking for as sure as the world for there was that white tip on the end of his tail and the rest of him was as black as jet He was taking matters very coolly trotting down the path as though he had no particular business on hand and the first thing that told him of the hunter s presence was the report of the gun which sent a charge of heavy shot into his head and breast He bounded high into the air and when he struck the ground again he rolled rapidly down the hill sending the twigs and withered leaves in every direction He struggled desperately to get upon his feet and continue his flight but he was too hard hit Oscar dashed down the hill after him and when he came up with the fox he found him lying motionless on a little pile of leaves which the winds had heaped against the side of a fallen log He had robbed his last henroost The boy picked him up and looked at him It was the first black fox he had ever seen but he had read and heard enough about the species to know that they were very rare and valuable and he was not a little elated over the success that had attended his hunt After loading his gun Oscar placed his prize on the ground where he could have a fair view of him and sat down on the log to admire him and wait for Bugle It was an hour or more before the hound appeared and his long absence accounted for the slow and deliberate movements of the fox The cunning animal had doubled on his trail and by making use of extra speed had placed such a distance between himself and his pursuer that haste was no longer necessary If left to himself he would probably have curled up in some warm spot and rested until the hound came within hearing when he would have jumped up and continued his flight When Bugle arrived on the ground he did not attempt to bite the fox as he generally did He simply smelt it wagged his tail vigorously in response to his master s caresses and words of praise and then stood off and looked up at him as if awaiting further orders We ll have something to eat old fellow before we do any more hunting said Oscar who always talked to his favorite as if the animal could understand every word he said We have earned a good dinner by this morning s work and we ll go and get it I declare it is ready now I had no idea it was so late Let s hurry up Oscar knew that dinner was ready because he heard signals exchanged between Mr Bacon s house and the field First a shrill female voice shouted Hooppee The call was repeated two or three times and then an answering Yeep uttered in deep masculine tones arose from the field below Oscar followed by Bugle hurried down the hill clambered over the fence and joined Mr Bacon and his two broad shouldered sons who had been at work repairing a stone wall They were on their way to the house but they stopped when they saw him coming and Mr Bacon discovering the prize he carried over his shoulder brought his hands together with a loud clap and shouted out a cordial welcome Well you done it didn t you he exclaimed That s the feller cause I d know him two mile off if I could see him that fur I told the boys I reckoned mebbe that was you a shootin up there an I had half a notion to send one on em up to see Come on now and get the dinner I promised you you and Bugle We ll fill him so full of meat that he won t do no more huntin this day that there hound dog won t Not meat please said Oscar it spoils a dog s nose Bugle has little besides corn bread and vegetables at home and he is entirely satisfied with his diet Well I reckon mebbe Johnnycake ll do him won t it Wife always has Johnnycake on Monday cause it s wash day you know When the farmer and his sons had examined Oscar s prize to their satisfaction and had told some remarkable stories of the skill he had exhibited in eluding his former pursuers Mr Bacon led the way toward the house His wife was loud in her praises and made Oscar laugh by declaring that she knowed that there fox was gone up when she heard that him and Bugle was goin to get after him Having performed his ablutions Oscar was shown to a seat at the table which fairly groaned under the weight of the good things that were piled upon it Mrs Bacon was sorry she hadn t something better to offer the successful sportsman but Oscar could see no necessity for any apologies It was not a picked up dinner if it was washing day He thought the farmer must have an idea that fox hunters were blessed with more than ordinary appetites for the plate that was passed over to him was filled so full that not another thing could have been placed upon it The meal was enlivened with conversation on various topics and when it was finished and the farmer had smoked his after dinner pipe Oscar picked up his fox and gun thanked Mrs Bacon for the good dinner she had given him and accompanied the three men to the field There he took leave of them and struck out across the hills toward home He was in no hurry now so he walked along very leisurely and picked up quite a respectable bag of game on the way Bugle drove three hares around to him and twice as many grouse fell to his double barrel At length when the increasing gloom of the woods told him that the day was drawing to a close Oscar tied his game together in a bunch with a strong cord he always carried in his game bag for that purpose called Bugle to him and set out at a brisk walk As he was working his way through a dense thicket on Mr Parker s hill farm he came suddenly upon two boys who just as he appeared in sight disappeared dropped a bundle of something behind a log and took to their heels One of them glanced over his shoulder as he ran and finally halted and faced about Don t be afraid Jeff he shouted to his retreating companion it s nobody but Oscar Preston Jeff stopped as soon as he could check his headlong flight and when he had satisfied himself as to the identity of the approaching hunter he came slowly back Oscar knew the two boys but he never had had anything to do with them They lived near the river and belonged to what the order loving portion of the villagers called a hard crowd What have you been up to asked Oscar as soon as he came within speaking distance Something mean I ll warrant No we haven t answered both the boys in concert We haven t been up to anything It was only necessary that Oscar should use his eyes to detect the falsehood One glance around explained everything The snares which Leon had worked so hard to build were all ruined Oscar knew that they were Leon s snares for no one else would be likely to build them on his father s grounds You are a contemptible couple said he indignantly although I don t know that one can expect you to be anything else What made you do it Well what made Leon shoot my tame pigeons the last time he was down to the river whined one of the boys He knowed they was mine but he plumped em over all the same I said I d spile something of his n some day to pay for it and I ve done it That s a pretty way to get even with him isn t it said Oscar I ve the best notion in the world to take you both by the neck and knock your heads together Did you find any birds in these snares Nary one and no rabbits neither What did you do with the triggers and strings We heaved em into the bushes as fur as we could and it s too dark to find em again Say Oscar you won t tell nobody about this will you That s a good feller No blarney now I ll tell you this much was Oscar s angry reply if I catch either of you in an act of this kind again I ll give you a shaking that will do your hearts good Now remember it So saying he walked past the young vandals who took care to give him all the room he wanted and disappeared in the thicket which covered the other side of the hill The two boys did not move or speak until they were certain that he had really gone and then one of them hurried to the fallen log snatched up the bundle that was lying behind it and ran off in a direction lying at right angles with the one Oscar had taken his companion following close behind him The bundle which seemed to be about as heavy as the boy could conveniently manage was made up of quail grouse and hares rightfully belonging to Leon If Oscar had not been in such haste to reach home and prepare his black fox for mounting if he had taken a little time to look into things as he afterward wished he had done a certain incident we have already recorded never would have happened CHAPTER XV BUGLE SEEKS REVENGE When the grouse and hares he had shot that day had been prepared for market and placed in the hands of the express agent Oscar ate his supper started a fire in his shop and set to work to skin the black fox and prepare it for mounting He intended that it should be his first contribution to the Yarmouth museum and he was anxious to make it the finest piece of work he had ever put up It was long after eleven o clock when he went to bed but at daylight he was in the woods with Bugle and by nine o clock three grouse and twelve out of a flock of fifteen quails he flushed just before reaching Mr Parker s hill farm had found their way into his game bag During his excursion of the previous day Oscar had found that birds were unusually abundant in Mr Bacon s neighborhood and he was slowly working his way in that direction when Bugle suddenly jumped a hare from a laurel thicket close in front of him Oscar who was thinking busily about something else was caught napping that time and before he could bring his gun to his shoulder the game had disappeared By running in a zig zag manner and making long leaps from side to side he succeeded in dodging the hound in the thick bushes But Bugle very soon found out what his tactics were and set to work to follow him up in a methodical and scientific way Knowing that a hare always runs in circles at the beginning of his flight Oscar sprang upon a fallen log that lay close at hand and waited for Bugle to bring the game around to the point from which he started He had scarcely settled himself to his satisfaction when the report of a gun rang through the woods followed by a doleful yelp from Bugle Oscar stood motionless with astonishment His first thought was that somebody had shot at the hare and hit the hound instead But a moment s reflection showed him that such an accident could not possibly happen under the circumstances The game had a good start and the dog could not have overtaken him in so short a time Beyond a doubt the concealed hunter whoever he was had shot Bugle on purpose With an exclamation of anger Oscar sprang down from his log and ran through the woods in the direction from which the report sounded When he had gone about a hundred yards he saw Bugle coming to meet him The animal seemed to be greatly excited for he bayed loudly and now and then he would stop and shake his head violently or sit down and scratch his ears Discovering his master he ran up to him laid his chin in his outstretched hand at the same time whining piteously and calling attention to his injuries by rubbing his paw over his head I didn t suppose you had an enemy in the world old fellow said Oscar trembling all over with indignation I know who did it It was those two river boys who destroyed Leon s snares Now we ll have a settlement with them if we can find them Why Bugle you are more scared than hurt after all While he was speaking Oscar made a hurried examination of his favorite s wounds and to his great delight discovered that but two shot had struck him and they had passed through one of his huge ears without touching his body at all Leon had not done as good shooting that morning as he usually did No doubt he was in a great hurry to have it over with and became nervous when he thought of the consequences that might follow his rash act or else the hound moved a little out of range just an instant before he pulled the trigger At any rate the shot was not as effective as Leon meant it should be but the wounded member bled profusely and his master s indignation increased while he looked at it Having satisfied himself that the hound was not seriously injured Oscar shouldered his gun again and set out at the top of his speed to overtake the bushwhackers A few minutes run brought him to the thicket in which Leon s snares were placed and there he stopped dropped the butt of his gun to the ground and finally walked over and seated himself on the very log on which Leon and his cousin had been sitting a short time before He had different opinions now regarding the identity of the bushwhackers It was plain enough to him that the river boys had nothing to do with the shooting Here were Leon s snares which had been completely destroyed the day before all in order and ready to catch the first thing that came within their reach He knew very well that the boys he had seen there on the previous day had not come back and repaired the mischief they had done they would be the last ones to think of such a thing It followed then that Leon must have repaired the snares himself that very morning and beyond a doubt it was he who shot the hound Oscar s indignation gave way to a feeling of sadness We ll not look any further Bugle said he And the hound which had stretched itself out at his feet and seemed to have forgotten all about the trifling injuries he had received rapped the leaves with his tail when his master spoke I don t want to see that boy for I might say or do something spiteful I can t understand it at all for I am sure I never did anything to Leon that should cause him to take such a revenge on me It can t be that he has anything against you Bugle for you never troubled him or anybody else did you I can t understand either how Leon happens to be in the woods to day for I know his father never lets him stay away from school to go hunting Let s go down to the brook and take a bath Bugle Leon and his cousin had not eluded pursuit so effectually as they thought they had for Oscar could have overtaken and confronted them in less than thirty minutes after the shooting was done had he felt so inclined He heard the reports of the shot gun and rifle which brought down the squirrels that supplied the runaways with a portion of their dinner and that was the way he found out that Leon was not alone Oscar knew that the other boy could be none other than Frank Fuller but he never thought of him in connection with the shooting for he did not believe that Frank had courage enough to perform an act of that kind He knew further that he had only to follow up the stream on the banks of which he spent half an hour in washing the blood from the hound s head to find the two boys for he saw the smoke of their camp fire rising above the tops of the trees But for the sake of the father who had been so kind to him Oscar was perfectly willing to overlook this unkindly act on the part of the son He saw that Bugle had forgotten all about it and he would try to forget it too After the hound s head had been bathed a few times the animal seemed to be himself again and when his master led him back to the place where he had been shot he took up the trail of his own accord and followed it with all his usual energy and zeal Oscar went back to his log and had scarcely taken up his position upon it when the frightened hare broke cover and was neatly stopped Oscar continued to hunt through the woods in the direction of the hollow in which Mr Bacon lived but at one o clock he turned and retraced his steps with both nets of his game bag completely filled and as large a bunch of birds and hares as he wanted to carry slung over his shoulder The game was left at the depot in time to be placed upon the evening s train for Yarmouth and on his way home Oscar stopped at the post office where he found two letters waiting for him One was from Calkins Son enclosing a check to pay for the grouse and hares he had sent them the night before and the other to his joy proved to be from one of the committee who had charge of the money which was to be expended in founding the university museum The letter was short and to the point and there were no Latin or Greek words in it to bother him It contained an invitation for him to visit the city at as early a day as possible bringing with him some specimens of his skill as a taxidermist If he would drop the writer a line by return mail telling him on what day and at what hour he might be expected to arrive in Yarmouth some member of the committee would meet him at the depot with a carriage Then came the following postscript Professor Kendall desires me to ask if you think there is any way in which he can recover his gun which was lost when the president s boat was capsized It is an imported weapon costing over three hundred dollars and as it was a present from a very dear friend he cannot bear the thought of giving it up His college duties have prevented him from visiting Eaton in regard to the matter I wonder what Sam Hynes will have to say now thought Oscar as he put the letter into his pocket If he doesn t come around to night I must go over to see him He is as much interested in my success as I am and I must keep him posted Now what ought I to take with me besides that black fox and when shall I tell them to look for me Oscar kept his mind on these matters all the way home He could have started for the city the very next day if it had not been for the fact that the committee wished to see some of his specimens Those he decided to take with him must all be mounted over again and that was very particular work and could not be hurried The birds must all be perched in trees and the standards that supported the trees as well as the board on which the black fox was placed must be painted and covered with moss and leaves preserved in paraffine to make them resemble the ground in the forest After that neat boxes must be made in which to pack the specimens for transportation and when Oscar had thought it all over he decided that the work could not be done in less than a week He told his correspondent so in the letter he wrote to him as soon as he reached home and set the following Wednesday for the start He added a piece of information that must have delighted Professor Kendall He said that the gun had been recovered with but very little effort that it was safe in his Oscar s hands and that in order to save express charges he would take it with him when he went to Yarmouth if its owner would consent to wait so long for it When the letter had been dropped into the office Oscar went home again and resumed his work upon the black fox While the specimen was growing into shape under his skilful hands he was suddenly startled by a loud scream of terror which sounded from the street and was immediately followed by angry bays and growls from Bugle Oscar wondering what could be the matter ran out into the yard with all haste and was greatly amazed to see Sam Hynes standing in front of the gate holding fast with both hands to the loose thick skin on the back of the hound s neck The animal had reared himself upon his hind legs and was struggling desperately to reach Leon Parker and his cousin Frank Fuller who stood a little further down the sidewalk trembling with fear and begging Sam not to let go his hold upon the enraged brute They knew that the hound recognized them and was determined to take revenge on them for what they had done that morning Had they taken to their heels the animal would have become more determined than ever Their safest course was to stand still and trust to Sam s grip Oscar had never before seen his favorite in such a fury Strong as Sam was it was all he could do to hold him In half a dozen jumps Oscar reached the gate and seizing Bugle around the body under his forelegs he dragged him into the yard with Sam s assistance and closed the gate upon him Leon and his cousin felt perfectly safe now They came slowly up the sidewalk their pale faces showing that they had sustained something of a fright What makes your dog act so asked Leon in a trembling voice at the same time moving toward the outside of the walk as he saw Bugle s white teeth gleaming between the pickets Is he mad Mad repeated Oscar who stood on the inside of the fence to keep the hound from jumping over it I shouldn t wonder if he was Wouldn t you be mad if somebody should send a charge of bird shot at your head The two boys opened their eyes and tried to look surprised but they only succeeded in looking guilty You don t mean to say that somebody shot him do you exclaimed Leon Yes I do and you were not far away at the time either It s false every word of it cried Frank with well feigned indignation We haven t seen him before to day Look here Towny said Sam you can t take that back any too quick As he said this he placed his hand on the latch and opened the gate which Oscar promptly closed again holding fast to it with one hand while he restrained Bugle with the other He had two obstinate and determined ones to manage now I mean he is mistaken for we didn t do it said Frank who saw that it would be no trouble at all to get into business then and there That sounds better replied Sam Now you keep still Nobody was saying a word to you when you chipped in Frank said no more and neither did Leon They stood silent for a moment and then with a common impulse walked toward home Oscar was glad to see them go and so was Bugle who speedily became his own friendly self again but Sam stood with his hands on the gate watching them and wishing that he had not allowed Oscar to keep him in the yard so easily Come into the shop said Oscar I ve got something there that will put you in good humor again Now as we walk along tell me how this trouble was brought about Bugle started it said Sam When I opened the gate he came out to meet me I saw there was something the matter with his ear and while I was examining it he happened to look down the street and saw Leon and Frank coming In an instant he was the maddest dog I ever saw He stuck up the hair on his neck gave a growl and charged through the gate Of course I didn t know what the matter was for I had never seen him act so before but knowing that he intended to use the teeth he showed so plainly I made a grab at him as he went through the gate and by the merest chance caught one of his hind legs Did you hear Frank scream I had no idea that a hound was so heavy and strong added Sam looking at his hands You came just in time for he would have slipped away from me in a minute Hey Sam who was on the point of seating himself on the work bench had just caught sight of the black fox Having never seen an animal like it before he examined it with the greatest interest Oscar had a good budget of news for his friend for the two last days were big with events Taking them in order he described all the incidents connected with his hunt after the prize he was then engaged in mounting and gave the particulars of his encounter with the two boys who destroyed Leon s snares He told all about the shooting of the hound gave a list of the game he had sent away during the afternoon and finally handed out the letter he had received from the committee To say that Sam was delighted with the letter would but feebly express his feelings He could not say enough in praise of Oscar s good fortune although he talked about it until almost dark When he saw his friend making preparations to light the lamp over his work bench Sam said good night and started for home CHAPTER XVI GOOD AND BAD NEWS Oscar now gave up hunting entirely he did not neglect to drop a line to the commission merchants telling them why he was obliged to do so and they in reply sent him a cordial invitation to visit them when he came to Yarmouth and devoted himself to the preparation of his specimens He worked hard all day and studied late every night and the nine o clock train which passed through Eaton on Wednesday morning carried him away with the rest of its passengers his specimens which were carefully and neatly boxed being stowed away in the express car In his hands Oscar carried the gun which he and Sam had fished up from the bottom of the river and by it he was recognized when he reached Yarmouth depot There were two gentlemen there waiting for him and one of them was the owner of the recovered fowling piece The instant he saw it he knew that Oscar was the boy he and his companion were looking for Oscar was gone just a week and what he saw and did during his absence and what bargain he made with the committee we shall learn as soon as he meets his friend Sam who of course must know all about it We will tell the reader this much however for it would not sound well coming from Oscar s lips even if he knew all about it which he did not The young taxidermist was almost overwhelmed by his reception He was introduced to the faculty to the students and to many prominent citizens as the brave youth who had saved President Potter s life That eccentric gentleman had never thought it worth while to mention the name of Sam Hynes in connection with his rescue but the reader may rest assured that Oscar did not neglect to do it Whenever the subject was spoken of in his hearing the active and important part taken by the cool headed Sam was faithfully and graphically described This one act on Oscar s part the saving of the president s life was enough to make him a hero in the eyes of all the strangers who surrounded him but what added to the interest with which they regarded him was the fact that he had been selected to complete the university s collection of birds and animals The faculty and students as well as some of the citizens knew that Professor Potter had at last found somebody to do the work and when it was announced that that somebody would soon visit Yarmouth to exhibit specimens of his skill his arrival was awaited with no little impatience The professor had not been at all particular about describing the person he had engaged and the students expected to find themselves confronted by a bearded fine looking man in buckskin or else in high top boots red shirt and slouch hat standing at least six feet high with broad shoulders and so powerful a grip that nobody would dare shake hands with him These being their ideas how great must have been their astonishment when there appeared among them one morning a neatly dressed modest youth who seemed to shrink away from them and who blushed every time anyone spoke to him They could scarcely believe their eyes but the committee took him and Oscar s position was established at once On the second day after his arrival he was invited to dine at the house of a prominent citizen and there he met a brilliant company including the gentleman who had given the money to found the museum The men treated him with a respect that astonished him and the ladies crowded around him and asked questions until Oscar wished most heartily that he could crawl into a hollow log somewhere and get out of sight Through all this trying ordeal the young taxidermist conducted himself with the utmost propriety but when the week was ended and he found himself on board the train bound for Eaton he drew a long breath of relief and said to himself Thank goodness it is all over Sam Hynes was at the depot when Oscar reached the village on Wednesday night and eager as he was to hear what his friend had to tell him he was still more eager to communicate to him a piece of news that was just then the talk of the town Oscar lingered for a few minutes on the platform to exchange greetings with two or three friends who chanced to be there but he drew away from them as soon as he could and started for home accompanied by Sam He was very anxious to see his mother Well said Oscar as they locked arms and walked briskly toward the village I don t see that Eaton has changed any during my absence Oh you don t exclaimed Sam One would think you had been somewhere to hear you talk I have been somewhere and in less than a week I am going somewhere else Have you any news for me I have and I know you will be sorry to hear it not on account of the young rascals themselves but on Mr Parker s account Leon and his cousin Frank Fuller have run away from home Oscar withdrew his arm and stopped and looked at his friend who backed off and put his hands in his pockets The two gazed into each other s faces for a few seconds and then locked arms and walked on again I hope there is some mistake about it said Oscar as soon as he could speak I wish there was from the bottom of my heart replied Sam earnestly Oscar was silent for several minutes He recalled all the favors for which he was indebted to the kind hearted lawyer thought of the numerous indulgences which he knew Mr Parker had granted his scapegrace son and then broke out fiercely Leon deserves to be thrashed within an inch of his life He is a mean boy who will run away from such a father as he has Just what I have remarked a score of times answered Sam But Mr Chamberlain says that the punishment he will receive before he gets through with this business will be worse than thrashing They packed up and cleared out on the very night that you went to Yarmouth Go on and tell me all about it said Oscar I don t know much to tell answered Sam for of course Mr Parker and his family have had very little to say about the matter The amount of it is that Leon has been in trouble ever since his cousin came here Frank led him into all sorts of scrapes and finally induced him to run away from school a thing Leon had never done before in his life On the same day Mr Fuller arrived from Boston to see how Frank was getting on with his studies and the first thing he learned in regard to him was that he had been playing truant The general impression seems to be that the young men were disciplined and that they got angry about it Where have they gone and what do they intend to do Nobody seems to know They took a good supply of clothing with them and also their guns Ah No doubt they intend to sell their guns in order to obtain money to pay their way observed Oscar There s no need of that answered Sam I don t know whether or not Frank had any money but Leon had a pocketful of it His grandfather of late years has made it a point to give Leon a hundred dollars every Christmas Unfortunately the money was deposited in the bank to Leon s credit and all he had to do was to present his book and draw the funds My gracious exclaimed Oscar what a scamp that boy must be He wouldn t be so bad if it wasn t for Frank He is the one who has led Leon into all this trouble Now let me ask you a few questions What luck have you had Your last letter made me believe that you had some good news for me And so I have replied Oscar I have had the best of luck and if nothing unforeseen happens I shall be on my way to the plains by a week from to night You don t tell me so cried Sam whose astonishment and delight were almost unbounded How was it all brought about I can hardly tell you for the truth is I have lived in such a state of excitement and bewilderment ever since I have been away that I hardly knew whether I stood on my head or my heels In the first place I was completely upset by the attentions that were shown me when I arrived in Yarmouth The officers of the college and this museum committee took me in charge at once They wouldn t let me go to a hotel as I wanted to do but President Potter he is not a crazy man Sam took me to his home and kept me there The next day I was shown over the university and all the students looked at me as if I had been some rare specimen of taxidermy I went into their museum and I tell you what s a fact Sam my specimens beat theirs all to pieces I am glad to hear it said Sam My specimens are there now continued Oscar and anybody can see for himself which is the best work It would have made you laugh to see those students crowd around me and ask me questions in natural history just as though I knew all about it The committee wanted me to put up some new specimens for them so I went down to the store of Calkins Son and picked out four nice ones a hare grouse mallard and black squirrel I told them who I was and what I wanted the birds and animals for and they wouldn t take a cent for them When I found that I was expected to put up these specimens in the presence of a class as well as the committee and explain every operation my hand trembled so that I could hardly hold the knife and I couldn t say a word You were embarrassed said Sam You had never received so much attention before And I hope I never will again said Oscar honestly Ah exclaimed Sam with a knowing shake of his head wait until you come back from the plains If you are successful they will make a lion of you What sort of work did you do before the class Oh after I got fairly started and gained a little confidence I was all right My tongue ran glibly enough and I never did quicker or better work in my life When I got through I had four as fine specimens as you ever saw Good exclaimed Sam Well what was the next thing The next thing was the best part of the whole business answered Oscar It was a private conference with the committee during which I was engaged for one year with the understanding that if they were satisfied with my work I was to keep right on until I had furnished the museum with specimens from every country on the globe Just think of that Whew whistled Sam In the first place as I told you I am to go out West My instructions are to confine myself entirely to large game although I am at liberty to secure any rare bird or animal that may chance to come in my way But I mustn t waste my time in hunting for them What they want most is a specimen of the Felis concolor and also Hallo exclaimed Sam What s the matter with you asked Oscar Nothing replied his companion I forgot that you had been through college Big words come easy to you since your association with those learned men don t they Well good night The boys had by this time reached Oscar s gate Bugle hearing the sound of his master s voice came over the fence without touching it and was so demonstrative in his greeting that Oscar was obliged to seize him by the neck and hold him off Oscar wanted Sam to go in but the latter declined He knew that his friend would want to talk to his mother about his good fortune and he wisely concluded that the presence of a third party might not be agreeable He would see Oscar the next day after school he said and listen to the rest of the narrative So Sam went home and Oscar went into the house He told his mother the same story he had told his companion adding an item of information that astonished her not a little CHAPTER XVII PAYING THE FIDDLER Let us now return to Leon and Frank whom we left at the close of the second chapter hastening over the hills toward home after spending the day in the woods They had by no means enjoyed themselves as well as they expected they should and now when it was too late they would have given almost anything if they could have lived the day over again They would have gone to school Like all guilty persons they were afraid and Leon did not attempt to conceal the fact although Frank did They ran almost all the way to the village and climbing the fence at the back of Mr Parker s lot they hurried across the field taking care to keep the barn between themselves and the house The merry shouts that came to their ears told them that they had not a moment to lose that school had just been dismissed They entered the barn through the back door and after hiding their guns and equipments in the hay mow ran out again They crept along on their hands and knees under cover of the currant bushes crossed two or three lots and finally reached the street in which the school house was located Then they breathed easier They slackened their pace and walked along like honest school boys believing that all danger of discovery was passed but what was their astonishment and alarm when one of their schoolmates who had seen them climb the fence hurried up to them exclaiming as soon as he came within speaking distance Hallo fellows where have you been to day We have been at home replied Frank who having a larger stock of falsehoods at his command than his cousin was always expected to speak for him We couldn t come to school to day That s very strange replied the boy Miles Jackson went to your house this morning to ask where you were and returned with the report that you had started for school as usual Leon was almost ready to drop and Frank as soon as he had somewhat recovered from his amazement asked angrily What business had Miles Jackson to make inquiries about us I d like to know The professor sent him replied the boy You see there was a new rule went into operation this morning Mr Chamberlain says he ll not be responsible for our advancement unless we come to school regularly and hereafter when any of the pupils are absent he s going to send somebody to their homes to find out what s the matter The boy hurried on to overtake some fellows he saw in advance of him leaving Frank and Leon standing on the sidewalk and looking at each other in speechless amazement It s all up with us groaned Leon as soon as he had recovered the use of his tongue We have danced and now we must pay the fiddler What a little snipe that Miles Jackson is exclaimed Frank in great disgust Why couldn t he tell the professor that we were kept at home Oh he isn t that sort replied Leon You needn t expect him to help you out of any scrape you get into No you can t expect such a favor from any fellow in this town snapped Frank It takes city boys to do that They stick to one another through thick and thin and any spoony who tries to win the favor of the teacher by carrying tales is cut dead as soon as he is found out There s another fellow who is mean enough for anything Don t talk so loud whispered Leon hastily You can get into trouble with him in a minute I don t care replied Frank in a still louder tone I haven t seen a boy yet in this town that I am afraid of The subject of this conversation was Sam Hynes who was striding along about twenty yards in front of them in his usual free and easy manner his hands in his pockets and his cap on the back of his head He must have been very much engrossed with his own thoughts or else he would certainly have heard what Frank said Arriving at the gate that led into Mrs Preston s yard he jerked it open Sam handled everything as if it were made of iron and to the intense amazement of Leon and his cousin was greeted by Oscar s hound The moment the gate was opened the huge animal raised himself on his hind legs and placed his forefeet upon Sam s shoulders Well I declare exclaimed Leon I thought as much replied his cousin There s that dog as gay and frisky as he was this morning when he was following that trail A pretty shot you made didn t you I know I hit him somewhere said Leon Let s have a look at him and see if I didn t It s strange how much everybody thinks of that hound He s got more friends in town than I have The cousins saw Sam pat the animal on the head then gently push him off and bend over to examine his ear Just then Bugle happened to look around the gate post and saw Frank and Leon approaching With an angry growl he dashed forward throwing Sam flatter than he had ever been thrown by any boy of his age and in a moment more something disagreeable and even tragic might have happened had it not been for Sam s wonderful agility He did not know what was the matter but he saw that the hound had made up his mind to bite somebody and he was resolved to prevent it if he could As Bugle passed him Sam caught him by one of his hind legs and scrambling quickly to his feet drew the dog toward him until he could seize him by the back of the neck But Frank thought the animal was coming and uttered a scream that could have been heard two blocks away Then Oscar appeared on the scene and after that came the colloquy we have already recorded during which two facts were brought to light One was that Oscar knew right where to look to find the person who had shot his favorite and the other that there was at least one boy in Eaton of whom the boastful Frank was afraid When Leon and his cousin resumed their walk toward home their faces were very pale but they soon recovered from their fright and then as a natural consequence they began to get angry They had got themselves deeply in trouble that day but instead of being sorry for it and making an honest resolve that they would do better in future they became enraged at their luck which had not served them a better turn Having no one else upon whom to vent their spite they began abusing each other If it hadn t been for Sam Hynes that dog would have made bad work with us exclaimed Frank You came very near getting us into a pretty scrape by your miserable marksmanship I wouldn t brag any more about my skill with a shot gun if I were in your place That s a nice way for you to talk isn t it retorted Leon Do I brag any more than you do You said there wasn t a boy in town you were afraid of and yet when you saw that Sam Hynes was going to open that gate you were in such a hurry to take back your words that you couldn t talk plainly The cousins being in a very bad humor continued to exchange such compliments as these until they arrived in sight of Mr Parker s house Then they became silent for they had other matters to think of What was going to happen when they got on the inside of that house They would have been glad if they could have found an excuse for postponing their entrance indefinitely but knowing that they must face the consequences of their folly sooner or later they opened the gate without hesitation mounted the steps and entered the sitting room To the no small astonishment of both boys the first person upon whom their eyes rested was Mr Fuller Frank s father He had come down from Boston to see how his son was getting on and hoping to hear a good report of him He also had some news to communicate that twenty four hours before would have made the boys dance with delight He had decided to start for California on a business tour in about three weeks he was going to take Frank with him and he had asked Mr Parker to allow Leon to accompany them The subject was broached that morning when Mr Fuller first arrived and Frank and Leon s prospects for making an extended pleasure trip looked very bright indeed but during the discussion Miles Jackson acting under instructions from Mr Chamberlain suddenly made his appearance and wanted to know why the boys were not at school The runaway business dashed all their prospects to the ground and that was only the beginning of their trouble Another occupant of the room whom the boys did not expect to see was Mr Parker who was generally at his office this hour of the day As the truants came in he arose and moved toward the library beckoning to Leon to follow him He closed the door behind him Mrs Parker left the room and Frank found himself alone with his father Well young man said Mr Fuller where have you been to day The boy did not know what to say He was in a scrape that he could not lie out of Where have you been to day repeated Mr Fuller sternly The look and the tone in which these words were uttered loosened Frank s tongue very quickly I have been in the woods sir said he Been in the woods repeated his father Ran away from school Sneaked out of the house like a thief Is this what I sent you to Eaton for No sir but I don t like this school and I don t want to stay here I want to go home You ll not go home You will stay right here and go to school every day and if I ever hear of your playing truant again there will be a settlement between us that you will remember Now young man I will tell you for your satisfaction that you have destroyed all your chances of going to California with me Don t expect any privileges until you have learned to behave yourself Mr Fuller settled back on the sofa and turned his attention to the paper he held in his hand while Frank after sitting uneasily on the edge of his chair for a few minutes and twirling his cap on his finger arose and left the room Presently the door of the library opened and Leon came out with red and swollen eyes and started for the barn When he returned he brought with him his cousin s rifle and his own double barrel which had been hidden in the haymow The double barrel and its equipments he carried into the library and saw them placed in one of the long drawers of the bookcase and locked up The rifle he carried to his own room where he found his cousin pacing back and forth flourishing his fists in the air and talking to himself He was in a state of almost ungovernable fury When Leon came in he stopped and looked at him What did your father say to you he asked and where is your gun My gun is under lock and key and I can t have it again this winter whined Leon Father says that if I am going to be a vagabond and spend my time in the woods I shall not have a gun to help me enjoy myself You got us both into a nice mess this morning didn t you Now don t go back on me in that fashion exclaimed Frank We are in a bad fix and we must stick together in order to get out of it These words seemed to make an impression upon Leon The angry scowl faded from his face and the next words he addressed to his cousin were spoken in a more friendly tone What did Uncle William say to you he inquired He said only one thing I can remember replied Frank and that is that I have lost all my chances of going out West That s just what my father said to me returned Leon It seems that Uncle William came here on purpose to make arrangements for taking us with him on his trip to California but by this day s work we have knocked everything on the head We ll see about that said Frank in a savage tone I wish you had been in Guinea before you proposed running away from school this morning continued Leon growing angry again and slamming his cousin s rifle down upon the bed You were ready enough to join in with me retorted Frank But go back on me if you feel like it I can take care of myself I am going to straighten things out in a hurry What do you intend to do I intend to clear out and I shall not be long about it either Father says I must stay here and go to school every day but I ll show him whether I will or not I wouldn t be afraid to bet him the twenty dollars I ve got in my trunk that I ll see that western country before he does Leon sat down on the bed and looked at his cousin without speaking CHAPTER XVIII LEON MAKES UP HIS MIND Your father couldn t have come here at a worse time could he said Leon at length He was disappointed rather than angry His uncle had formed some very elaborate plans for his enjoyment and also Frank s and they had knocked them all on the head by running away from school It was Mr Fuller s intention to cross the plains on horseback the Pacific Railroad was not in existence at the time these incidents happened and return by steamer The boys would have been delighted by a trip like this and they might have gone had it not been for their one act of folly Frank showed a disposition to smash things when he thought about it but Leon felt more like crying His coming here made no difference He would have found out all about it sooner or later for your father would have written him full particulars But I don t care said Frank who continued to stride up and down the room shaking his fists in the air I am going to clear out and if you have any pluck at all you will do the same Leon placed his elbows on his knees fastened his eyes upon the floor and made no immediate reply He had talked very glibly about leaving his comfortable home and going out into the world to make himself famous as a hunter and Indian fighter but in dreaming about it he had always skipped the preliminaries How he was going to leave home and make his way to that pleasant valley in the mountains in which he intended to build his cabin he did not know nor did he care to trouble himself about it Some boys as we know make great calculations and have much to say about the fame they expect to win when they are established in some business or profession and have plenty of money at their disposal but they make no note of the long hours that must be spent in study and hard work before they can attain to the desired eminence So with Leon He sometimes spent half the night going through imaginary fights with grizzly bears Indians and outlaws and picturing to himself the delight that would be his when he was fairly settled in his mountain home but he did not like to dwell upon the thought that before all this could be accomplished he must sneak away from his father s house like a thief in the night and make a long journey by rail and steam boat before he would be anywhere within reach of his hunting grounds But now these matters were brought squarely home to him and it was high time he was bestowing some thought upon them You don t seem to be very enthusiastic said Frank suddenly pausing in his walk and looking sharply at his cousin No longer ago than this morning you talked as though you were crazy to get away from home and become your own master I wish I could see that western country before I go there to live said Leon I don t know anything about it Well how are you going to find out anything about it until you go there asked Frank And how are you going to get there unless you pack up and start off on your own hook My father will not take you or me either How much money have you got in the bank Six hundred dollars replied Leon Whew whistled Frank opening his eyes in great amazement That will take us to Independence with flying colors After we get there we ll buy a couple of saddle horses and a pack mule and then we ll be all right we ll not ask favors of anybody But how will we know which way to go asked Leon Oh we ll look for a wagon train that s the way the most of the emigrants do If we can t find one we ll start off by ourselves We can t get lost for the trails are as plain as the road in front of the house But the Indians might find us suggested Leon What s the matter with you anyhow demanded Frank sharply If you don t want to go say so at once and I ll start off by myself The Indians won t bother us until we get where they are will they There are none along these trails of which I speak Why as early as travelling there was perfectly safe Have you never heard of the two thousand Mormons who walked and pushed hand carts all the way from Iowa City to Salt Lake They were often attacked by wolves we shouldn t mind the wolves you know a few fights with them would relieve the monotony of our journey but the history of that expedition doesn t say that they ever saw an Indian When Leon heard this he straightened up and began to take some interest in what his cousin was saying but it is probable that his interest would have died away again very speedily if he had been told something of the history of those hand cart expeditions It is thirteen hundred miles from Iowa City to Salt Lake Valley and it requires fifteen weeks of constant travelling to accomplish the distance Of the first division of five hundred Mormons who left Iowa City in July to trundle their hand carts to Salt Lake one hundred and twenty perished miserably before reaching their destination Their cattle starved or died from overwork their provisions gave out winter overtook them while they were still five hundred miles from the valley and it was no uncommon thing for them to wake up in the morning and find from three to fifteen of their number cold in death Of the second company of six hundred which left the Missouri in August only four hundred and fifty reached the valley and out of the whole number two thousand three hundred were starved frozen or devoured by wolves and two hundred were maimed for life Frank knew all this for he had read a full account of it but it did not daunt him for he believed that in some mysterious way he would be able to escape the perils that fell to the lot of other travellers on the plains I ll not say a word to Leon about the dangers they encountered soliloquized Frank for if I do it will take all the pluck out of him He hasn t even courage enough to run away from a tyrant of a father I can see that plainly enough but as I am determined to go myself and he has money while I have none to speak of I must get him interested in the matter Now how am I going to do it That s the question Frank relapsing into silence placed his hands behind his back and resumed his walk up and down the room turning the question over in his mind If he had only known it there was no need that he should trouble himself about the matter for that very night an incident happened that turned the scale in his favor While he was wondering what he could say that would induce his cousin to fall in with his wild scheme the supper bell rang The truants would have been glad of an excuse for disregarding the summons but knowing that if they did not answer it immediately somebody would come upstairs to see about it they made a hasty toilet and descended to the dining room To their great relief nothing was said or done to indicate that anything had gone wrong that day Their fathers had had a settlement with them and that was the end of the matter They were treated with as much consideration as they usually were but Frank grew angry again when his father talked about the mines in which he was interested and described the wonders which he expected to see during his absence Frank finished his supper as soon as he could and then gave his cousin a wink which the latter understood As they asked to be excused and arose from the table Mr Parker turned from his brother in law with whom he was conversing and said to his son Leon don t go away to night No sir replied the boy Do you know what that means he added angrily when he and his cousin were safe in their room again It means that my liberty is stopped that I can t even go outside of the gate any more until father says the word Well you re a fool if you stand it replied Frank Make up your mind to go with me and then you can do as you please My mind is made up exclaimed Leon with a sudden burst of fury If my gun wasn t locked up I d start to night and if I once get away I ll never set my foot in Eaton again That gun is just what troubles me replied Frank We can t get it until my father goes away because he or some of the family are always in the sitting room Does one key unlock every drawer in that bookcase Leon replied that it did Then we needn t worry I have often seen the key left in the doors of the bookcase and when we get ready to start we ll have that gun out of there All we ve got to do is to watch our chance and slip into the library some night when the sitting room is empty Where is your bank book In mother s bureau Have you got pluck enough to steal it out of there Yes I have answered Leon with more spirit than his cousin had ever seen him exhibit before Well after you get it will you go to the bank and draw your money Yes I will I m not going to be deprived of all privileges and shut up as if I were a felon That s the way to talk said Frank giving his cousin an approving slap on the back I was mistaken in you You have some courage after all Frank was satisfied now If he could only keep his cousin in an angry mood he was sure of money enough to defray his expenses to the plains It was not so very difficult to do this for events seemed to conspire to assist them CHAPTER XIX PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS The discussion thus commenced was kept up until midnight and Leon gladdened the heart of his cousin by repeatedly declaring that he had determined upon his course and that nothing could induce him to change his mind They did not go out of their room again that night They sat at the window and talked about the glorious times they expected to have when they reached the plains and when Mr Parker and Mr Fuller went out of the gate and started for the village Frank took occasion to comment upon it They are free to go and come as they please said he with no little show of temper and here we are shut up like a couple of thieves You are not shut up said Leon Your father didn t tell you to stay in Do you suppose that I am going to enjoy myself unless you can go too asked Frank who seemed to have grown very disinterested all of a sudden No sir We got into this trouble together and we ll stick to each other until we are safely out of it I ve just thought of something said Leon suddenly How are we going to get an excuse to morrow You can t write one for the professor has found out through that little snipe Miles Jackson that we ran away We ll not say a word about it replied his cousin If your father feels like giving us an excuse all right if he doesn t we ll go without one Frank spoke as though he had no interest in the matter but it troubled him not a little It troubled Leon too and it was not settled until the next morning when Mr Parker said to Leon as the latter arose from the breakfast table I think it would be a good plan for you to look over the lessons you missed yesterday I will call at ten minutes of nine and walk down to the school house with you Yes no doubt I ll look over those lessons said Leon when he and his cousin had closed the door of the room behind them I ll see all the school books in the country in Guinea before I will touch one until I am obliged to do so But Leon was handling his school books even while he spoke He and Frank had each two sets one at school and another which they kept at home and which they were supposed to study occasionally of evenings The first thing the two boys did was to scatter their books all over the table so that if Mr Parker should happen to come into the room he would be led to believe that they had been studying and then they sat down and talked about the subject that was uppermost in their minds At the appointed time Mr Parker came to the foot of the stairs and called to them to come down He walked with them to the school house and leaving them in the yard entered the building and sought an interview with Mr Chamberlain What passed between the two gentlemen the truants never knew There was nothing said to them about running away from school and they very soon became satisfied that their previous day s work would bring them into no trouble with their teacher But they got into trouble with somebody else before four o clock came It happened on the ball ground during the afternoon recess Leon was having a good deal to say regarding Oscar Preston s dishonesty and Mr Smith s refusal to give him a letter of recommendation and Frank was helping him by putting in a word occasionally when Sam Hynes and his base ball bat suddenly appeared on the scene Leon s speech was brought to a sudden close for he was doubled up like a jack knife by a punch in the ribs from the bat and Frank escaped similar treatment by taking to his heels The consequence was that the names of Sam Hynes and Leon Parker appeared among those of other delinquents who were requested to keep their seats when the rest of the students were dismissed At the end of half an hour a settlement had been had with all the law breakers except Sam and Leon The principal looked at them a moment and said solemnly Boys I am sorry to hear that you have been fighting Mr Chamberlain said Sam I did all the fighting that was done Leon never lifted a hand The professor looked down at the paper cutter he held in his hand and finally said Parker you may go Good for me said Leon to himself as he hurried down the stairs I am well out of that scrape I hope you ll get a good licking Mr Sam Hynes that s all the harm I wish you If Leon had been standing in front of the school house about ten minutes later he would have been disappointed and perhaps greatly disgusted A step sounded in the hall and Sam Hynes came bounding out as if he were set on springs When he reached the steps he thrust his hands into his pockets struck up a lively whistle and walked off with an air which seemed to say that he was well satisfied with the world and everybody in it himself included It was evident from his actions that he had not been very severely reprimanded for the part he had taken in the affair on the ball ground but Leon could not say as much for himself half an hour after he arrived at his father s house Frank had been loitering along the road waiting for Leon and when the two reached home they found all the family there as before Leon was at once invited into the library while Frank who did not care to stay where his father was went up to his room He wondered what was wrong now and when his cousin came up he found out Leon s face was very pale his eyes were red and swollen and Frank had never seen him so angry before Father knows all about that fuss we had at school to day said he as soon as he entered the room He heard some of the students talking about it at the post office It beats me how many fellows there are in the world who can t be easy until they tell all they know Well what of it inquired Frank shortly What of it repeated Leon Father gave me the worst going over I ever had in my life He praised Oscar up to the skies and told me in so many words that I would do well to take him for a model The idea exclaimed Frank A market shooter He is a pretty model for any decent boy It has always been so said Leon bitterly Father sees something good in everybody except me and if I am so awful bad he won t feel sorry when I get out of his sight After this Leon seemed to throw all his fears and scruples to the winds He had got it into his head that he was a badly abused boy that he would be in trouble as long as he remained in Eaton and he was impatient to get out into the world where he could do as he pleased without any fear of being taken to task for his misdeeds Mr Fuller remained in Eaton for nearly two weeks and Frank who did not think it safe to attempt to carry out his plans until his father was well on his way toward home fumed and fretted all the day During that time the two discontented boys went to school regularly it was dangerous to play truant now that that new rule had gone into operation and if they learned nothing else they did learn these four things That Oscar Preston s reputation had been cleared that Mr Smith had apologized and offered to make all the amends in his power that Oscar and Sam Hynes had made heroes of themselves by saving a man from drowning and that the man was rich and was going to do something for Oscar They were not however acquainted with the fact that the rescued man had already done something for the young taxidermist in that he had offered him a hundred dollars a month and expenses to procure specimens for the university museum In fact there were very few people in the village who knew that for Oscar had spoken of it only to those whom he was sure he could trust with the secret There was an interview yet to come with the members of the committee and Oscar thought it would be time enough to speak of the professor s offer after the result of that interview was known Tuesday morning came at last and Mr Fuller after taking leave of his son and giving him some good advice to which it is hardly necessary to say Frank paid no sort of attention stepped into Mr Parker s carriage and was driven to the depot Frank stood on the porch with his aunt and cousin watching the carriage as long as it remained in sight He had assumed a very sober face for the occasion and seemed to be much dejected When the carriage disappeared he went slowly up the stairs to his room and Leon followed him The moment the latter closed the door Frank s countenance changed as if by magic Now then said he briskly the time for action has come Go down and steal that bank book and be quick about it for it is almost school time I am almost afraid to do it answered Leon Mother may have occasion to go to that bureau drawer some time during the day and what would become of us if she should miss the book and make inquiries about it The risk is too great Whenever I steal that book we must draw the money and get out of town without an hour s delay Now how in the world are we going to do that questioned Frank impatiently We can t walk out of town with our guns and carpet bags in broad daylight You must get that book now take it to school with you and run down to the bank at noon and draw the money When we come home we ll think up some way to get your gun and as soon as it grows dark we ll slip out and start for Franklin where we will board the first western bound train If we get on the cars at this station we will run the risk of being seen by a dozen people who will recognize us We can t help taking some chances and if you are afraid to do it you can stay here and welcome I am off to night Frank talked rapidly for time was precious When he ceased speaking Leon opened the door with an air of dogged resolution and went downstairs CHAPTER XX LEON DRAWS HIS MONEY Frank was by no means so much at his ease as he appeared to be He knew as well as Leon did that they were playing an extremely hazardous game and the fear that their plans might be defeated made him so nervous that he could not keep still to save his life He paced restlessly up and down the room awaiting his cousin s return with no little impatience Leon was gone a long time so long that Frank began to be alarmed He was on the point of going in search of him when he heard his step on the stairs A moment thereafter the door opened and Leon came in His face was as white as a sheet and his hands trembled as though he had been seized with an attack of the ague Well said Frank I ve got it replied Leon in a scarcely audible whisper and I came near being caught in the act too I had to wait until mother went into the kitchen then I slipped into the bedroom and had just taken the book out of the drawer when I heard her coming back I tell you I thought I should drop when she asked me what I was doing in there and what made my face so pale Whew added Leon drawing his hand across his forehead It was a close call I don t know how I shall manage to get that gun Don t worry over it answered Frank who knew that everything depended upon keeping up his cousin s courage We can think about it when the time comes to secure the gun If I see a chance I ll get it for you myself The two boys were now anxious to leave the house with the least possible delay They seemed to think that as long as they remained there they were in danger of being found out They hurried off to school as soon as they could find their caps and during the whole of that forenoon lived in a state of excitement and fear that can hardly be described Leon s bank book felt as heavy as lead in his pocket Of course he felt guilty and it seemed to him that the students sitting in his immediate vicinity stared at him a good deal and with an expression on their faces which seemed to say that they knew all about it More than once Leon was on the point of backing squarely out and writing a note on his slate to his cousin telling him he would not go but every time he resolved upon this a neat little cabin in the mountains with its luxurious beds of buffalo robes joints of venison and bear meat hanging from the rafters and a couple of fleet Indian ponies feeding in the glade close by would rise before his mental vision and Leon would tell himself that it was worth while to run some risk if by so doing he could live in that way Then there was his unhappy home Leon did not consider that it was made so by his own acts the gloomy school room the law against going outside the gate the prohibition that had been laid upon his hunting for the rest of the season all these things came into his mind and Leon would shut his teeth hard and resolve again that he would carry out his plans no matter what happened As the hour of twelve drew near Leon became as nervous and frightened as he was when he stole the bank book in the morning The money must be drawn from the bank and it must be drawn too before one o clock or not at all that day It would be dangerous to postpone this important matter for his parents might discover that the book was gone from the drawer and that would lead to an investigation The sooner their plans were carried into execution and they were safe out of town the better it would be for them When school was dismissed the two boys hurried down the street keeping a good lookout on every side for Leon s father The lawyer s office was over the bank and they did not want to go in there after the money until they had satisfied themselves that he had gone home to his dinner Mr Parker had a good deal of business to do with the bank and what if he should happen to drop in just as the cashier was handing out Leon s six hundred dollars The bare thought was enough to frighten them and they were very cautious in their movements They did not see Mr Parker s carriage when they reached Main Street but they thought it best to reconnoitre before entering the bank so they kept on down the street and when they passed the stairs leading to Mr Parker s office they glanced into the hall and saw him standing there conversing with a couple of gentlemen That knocks us whispered Leon We must give it up for to day No sir answered Frank emphatically You ll never make your way in the world if you are going to give up as easy as that Let s go where we can keep an eye on him He ll go to his dinner pretty soon As Frank spoke he led the way across the street and into Smith Anderson s store One of the clerks came up to serve them but Frank said they didn t want anything Of course your father saw us come in here said he in a whisper to Leon and if he follows us to see what we are about we ll buy some crackers and cheese for a lunch But Mr Parker did not follow them The boys had scarcely taken up their positions in front of the window when he came out of the hall and went into the bank If Leon and his cousin had not exercised so much caution he would certainly have caught them there At the end of ten minutes he came out and walked briskly across the park toward home As soon as he had disappeared the boys opened the door and went out They hurried across to the bank and Leon with a trembling hand placed his book upon the glass shelf in front of the cashier s desk How much do you want to day Leon asked that officer I want all of it sir was the reply All of it repeated the cashier The words were uttered in a tone of surprise and Leon almost expected that the man would tell him he could not pay out so large a sum of money until he knew what it was to be used for but he did nothing of the kind He knew that the boy had been allowed by his indulgent father to manage his bank account to suit himself and he had no comments to make He consulted a huge ledger that lay on one of the desks made some figures with a pencil in Leon s book and then he came back and began counting out the money While he was thus engaged the boys paced back and forth in front of the desk and cast frequent and anxious glances toward the door fearing that somebody might come in But luck was on their side and their fears were not realized The cashier was a long time in counting out the money but finally he completed his task and handed out to Leon a pile of bills that made him and Frank open their eyes in the greatest amazement It was so large that when Leon rolled it up he could hardly get it into his pocket My gracious he exclaimed as he and Frank hurried out and bent their steps toward the school house I had no idea that I owned so much cash Six hundred dollars is a nice little amount of money answered Frank and you must have a tidy sum there for interest I tell you Leon that will set us up in good shape It will buy us a splendid outfit and keep us in provisions until we can capture furs enough to get more We have taken two dangerous steps and there are only two left What are they asked Leon Stealing your gun out of that bookcase is one and leaving the house with our baggage is the other If we can take those two steps without being caught we can breathe easy for we shall have nothing but plain sailing before us It turned out that Frank was anything but a good prophet Circumstances rendered it comparatively easy for them to secure the gun and leave the house but they did not afterward have plain sailing It was but a short time after that that the trouble began CHAPTER XXI THE RUNAWAYS During the afternoon Leon was so nervous and uneasy that he could scarcely keep his seat There were two ways now in which he could be detected His mother might go to the bureau drawer and find that the bank book was missing or the cashier might casually ask Mr Parker if the latter had occasion to enter the bank if his son had an idea of going into business A question like that would of course excite the lawyer s curiosity and might lead to inquiries on his part that would bring the whole plot to light It was only by neglecting his books entirely and dwelling upon the joys of a hunter s life that Leon could keep up his courage He failed completely in every one of his recitations and his teacher losing all patience at last informed him that if those lessons were not fully mastered by the next time he came into the class room he would have the privilege of studying them after school Not much I won t study those lessons after school said Leon to himself as he returned to his seat I have been kept as a delinquent for the last time I hope that after to day I shall never see a school book When the cousins started for home that night the fears that had haunted them all the day long increased tenfold Leon did not want to face his father and mother after what he had done and he took good care to keep out of their way until supper time It was a wonder that Mr and Mrs Parker did not suspect the boys of some wrong doing for their agitation when they came downstairs in response to the call of the bell was almost too palpable to escape notice They arose from the table after making a very light supper and started for their room That was the last time Leon expected to see his father and mother that night and perhaps forever and he was already telling himself that all danger of discovery was past when his father suddenly called to him The boy s heart almost came up into his mouth as he turned about and went back into the dining room Why Leon exclaimed Mr Parker now for the first time noticing the boy s pale face and trembling hands what is the matter with you Are you ill No sir stammered Leon I am not sick but I haven t felt like myself to day And that is the honest truth he added mentally I have been so upset by excitement and suspense that I have scarcely realized what was going on around me I couldn t stand another day like this I am sorry to hear it said Mr Parker I wish you had spoken of it this morning I don t want you to go to school if you don t feel well for of course you can t study Would you like to go to the concert with us to night No I thank you sir replied Leon I would rather stay at home Well ask Frank if he wants to go I have tickets and seats for all of us Leon went out again but instead of going toward the hall he turned into the sitting room The door of the library was open and Leon paused in front of it just long enough to take one look at the bookcase Then he went up to his room where he found Frank pacing back and forth in a state of great excitement He was afraid that everything had been discovered but one glance at his cousin s face reassured him What did your father say to you he inquired as soon as Leon had closed the door He asked me if I was sick My gracious my face is white isn t it said Leon as he glanced into the mirror and wanted to know if I felt like going to the concert to night I replied that I would rather stay at home and he told me to ask if you would like to go Good exclaimed Frank bringing his hands together with aloud slap As soon as they start we ll start I looked into the library before I came up continued Leon and I saw that the key of the bookcase is in one of the doors Isn t that lucky cried Frank who was almost ready to dance with delight Everything seems to be working in our favor Now in order to save time we had better pack our valises The manner in which the two boys went at this work showed that they were in earnest about it and that neither of them had the least idea of backing out They had already selected the clothing they intended to take with them and in half an hour after that the valises were packed and placed in the closet out of sight This done the boys sat down to talk about the glorious life upon which they were so soon to enter and to wait until the time came to leave the house which would be when Leon s father and mother had started for the concert Darkness came on apace and presently the boys heard Mr Parker calling from the foot of the stairs whereupon Leon went out into the hall and looked over the balusters Does Frank want to go with us asked the lawyer No sir shouted Frank from his seat in the window I ll stay with Leon Very well Now Leon don t go away to night The boy made no reply Do you understand me asked his father Yes sir said Leon Mr Parker being satisfied with the answer followed his wife out of the front door and the boys stood at the window and saw them go out of the gate and turn down the street When they were out of sight Leon sprang into the middle of the room and made an awkward attempt to dance a hornpipe I didn t promise him that I wouldn t go away to night did I said he gleefully I simply told him that I understood his order If he thinks that a boy of my age is going to be confined in a gloomy school room all day and then shut up in the yard at night as if he were an unruly dog he will find he has made a big mistake Now I ll go down and get my gun the first thing I do Don t be in a hurry said the cautious Frank Something might happen to bring your father back here and if he should chance to go to that drawer our cake would be all dough Don t touch the gun until we are ready to start It would never do for us to be caught now after we have carried out all our plans so nicely Shall we leave a note telling them why we ran away asked Leon No sir If they are anxious to know all they have to do is to think of the manner in which they have treated us I wish it would hurry up and grow dark The impatient boys spent another half hour in walking up and down their room and then Leon declared he would wait no longer At his suggestion Frank went out to the gate to reconnoitre and when he had satisfied himself that the coast was clear and that there was no danger of interruption he announced the fact by a shrill whistle and walked slowly toward the house When he entered the hall Leon was ascending the stairs with his recovered gun in his hands I feel as though I had found a long lost friend said he as he flourished the weapon over his head There ll be some astonished people in this house to morrow The boys went back to their room and when Leon s gun had been placed in its case and the powder flask and shot pouch belonging to it had been packed away in one of the valises they picked up their baggage took their weapons under their arms and went down the stairs They paused a moment on the threshold of the front door to make sure that there was no one passing along the street and then without a single feeling of regret they turned their backs upon their home and upon the friends they never expected or even wished to see again and hurried away The little town of Franklin toward which they bent their steps was situated on the railroad seven miles west of Eaton It was there that they intended to purchase tickets and board the cars By this piece of strategy they hoped to avoid meeting anybody who might recognize them The platform of the depot in Eaton was always crowded at train time and if they had been seen loitering about there with their guns and valises in their hands they might have been asked some questions that they did not care to answer Leon led the way avoiding the principal streets as much as he could and at the end of an hour the runaways struck the main road about two miles above the village Settling down into a steady walk they moved briskly along toward Franklin but before they had gone many rods they heard a wagon coming up behind them Let s wait and ask him to give us a ride said Frank He is going our way Not by a long shot answered Leon quickly I am acquainted with almost everybody about here and I won t take the risk This man might know me Let s hide and wait until he goes by Suiting the action to the word Leon sprang into the bushes that lined the nearest fence and crouched down among them his example being promptly followed by his cousin In a few minutes the wagon came up and passed their hiding place but not so the dog which trotted along a little distance in the rear industriously exploring the bushes on each side of the road His sharp nose quickly revealed to him the presence of the runaways and bounding toward the thicket in which they were concealed he set up a terrific yelping Get out there said Frank in a savage whisper lifting his rifle above his head The dog saw the motion and beat a hasty retreat but he went no farther than the middle of the road where he stopped and barked furiously CHAPTER XXII THE PRAIRIE HOTEL Knock him down with something whispered Leon in great excitement as he searched frantically about on the ground for some missile to throw at the dog Let s go out on the road suggested Frank He ll leave if we start toward him Yes but I don t want that man to see us for I don t know who he is Well he ll certainly see us if we allow this miserable cur to stay here and bark at us returned Frank The first thing you know his master will be back here to see what is up and we ll be I declare there he comes now Leon looked over the bushes and trembled in every limb when he saw the owner of the dog approaching He stopped by the side of the road picked up a formidable looking club and after trying its strength by striking it on the ground he hurried toward the thicket in which the runaways were concealed Sick em Maje sick em he shouted Take hold of em you rascal Thus encouraged the dog bounded into the bushes and in a moment more would have seized Frank by the leg had he not received a terrific punch in the ribs from Leon s double barrel That took all the fight out of him With a howl of anguish he ran back to the road and took refuge behind his master who halted very suddenly He looked first at the dog and then at the bushes and finally he began to back off toward his wagon It was evident that he did not think it safe to advance any nearer to the thicket but he seemed determined to find out what it was that had taken refuge there for after he had retreated a short distance he stopped and began swinging his club around his head In a moment more it would have been sent crashing into the fence corner had not Frank who could plainly see the motion called out What are you about there Good land o Goshen exclaimed the man lowering the threatening bludgeon Who be you and what did you crawl in there for Now you ve done it whispered Leon in great alarm That s Mr Jenkins the farmer who supplies us with wood I know his voice I ll talk to him whispered Frank in reply You stay here and when you hear me whistle come out and bring my gun with you As he said this he placed his rifle in his cousin s hand picked up his valise and walked out into the road The dog showed a disposition to be belligerent when he came in sight but a few words from his master accompanied by a flourish of the club put a stop to his demonstrations It s a pity that a fellow can t step aside to rest for a moment without having a dog set on him exclaimed Frank Is that the way you generally treat people in this country I declare to man I didn t know it was a boy that was hid in them bushes said the farmer apologetically I reckoned mebbe it was some kind of a varmint cause Maje kicked up such a row Goin my way Jump in and I ll give you a lift I am obliged to you but I would rather walk You can ride just as well as not urged the farmer I aint got no load Thank you I don t care to ride replied Frank rather impatiently I am in no hurry The man lingered as if he wanted to say something else but finally turned and went back to his wagon followed by Maje who looked over his shoulder and growled savagely at Frank by way of bidding him good night Presently the sound of wheels on the hard road told Frank that the farmer s wagon was in motion He waited until the sound grew faint in the distance and after looking up and down the road to make sure that there was no one else coming uttered a low whistle In a few minutes Leon came up and the two resumed their walk toward Franklin This was the first and last adventure that befell the boys during their journey to the frontier They reached the town of Franklin in a little less than two hours and there they purchased tickets for Albany at which place so they were told they could procure through tickets to St Louis The train arrived an hour later and in five minutes more the runaways were being carried rapidly toward the happy hunting grounds of which they had so often dreamed When they arrived at St Louis they boarded a steamer which carried them up the Missouri River and in due time they found themselves with their valises in their hands and their guns on their shoulders standing on the levee at St Joseph at which point they had decided to fit out for the plains Had they enjoyed themselves during their trip Certainly not No one could take pleasure in a railroad or steamboat ride under such circumstances One strange thing we have to record here is that Frank was no longer the leader Being a city boy he knew more about the ways of the world than his country cousin and Leon had leaned upon and looked to him for advice but after they had cut loose from home and friends and were surrounded by strangers Frank began to grow frightened and lost a good deal of his assurance He gradually fell back into the second place and Leon stepped to the front and assumed command of the expedition He had more pluck and determination than his cousin and now these qualities began to show themselves The boys stopped on the levee and gazed about them with the greatest interest St Joe did not look much like Eaton It was a frontier town at the time of which we write and everything was new and strange to the runaways Canvas covered wagons such as emigrants use were constantly passing bearded men in red shirts and high top boots were lounging about and now and then an Indian wrapped up to the chin in his blanket would walk by with dignified step Well here we are said Leon at length and I must confess that things don t look just as I thought they would No they don t and I wish to goodness that we were safe at home again said Frank giving utterance to the thought that had passed through his mind a score of times since he left Eaton I am afraid we can t make a success of it It is too late to talk that way said his cousin You know that we discussed the matter thoroughly before we started and made up our minds that we could face anything that came in our way But I didn t know that frontiersmen were such rough fellows Just look at these men standing around Their appearance is enough to frighten one If you are so easily frightened what will you do when we get out to the mountains asked Leon Frank made no audible reply but to himself he said I don t intend to go to the mountains I am just as far from home already as I want to be Our first hard work must be to hunt up a hotel continued Leon and our next to find some experienced man who is good natured enough to give us some advice The boys walked up the levee and turned into the first street that they found and which proved to be the principal thoroughfare As they strolled slowly along their attention was frequently attracted by such notices as these which were posted in some of the store windows Parties fitted out for the plains HUNTERS TRAPPERS AND MINERS SUPPLIES They lingered long in front of these windows and Leon s enthusiasm over the rifles hunting knives and revolvers that were there displayed was so contagious that Frank forgot his homesickness and began to take a little more interest in things Here s the place we re looking for exclaimed Leon at length As he spoke he pointed to a sign that hung over the sidewalk Frank looked and saw that it bore the words PRAIRIE HOTEL Of course all the plainsmen must stop here continued Leon We ll hang around for a day or two until we make the acquaintance of some of them and perhaps they will tell us all we want to know Let s go in Frank followed his cousin through the door and found himself in the principal room of the hotel which did duty as a parlor office and bar Every chair and bench was occupied and there was a crowd of men about the counter who were talking loudly They were all rough looking fellows and Frank trembled when he saw that some of them wore revolvers and knives strapped about their waists These were mainly gold hunters who had just returned from the mountains They had become so accustomed to wearing their weapons while they were in the mines that they did not think to take them off even though they were among civilized people The room was dingy and smoky and reminded Frank of the sailors boarding houses into which he had often glanced as he passed along the wharves of Boston The boys first impulse after they had run their eyes about the apartment and taken a good look at its occupants was to open the door and go out again but before they could act upon it the proprietor of the hotel who had seen them enter came briskly out from behind the bar and approached them He was as roughly dressed as any of his guests and looked so fierce that when he reached out his hand for Leon s valise the boy surrendered it at once Can I do anything for you said he Leon did not think it would be safe to tell the man that he had concluded to look further for lodgings so he asked in reply Can we stay here for a day or two You re mighty right was the answer You re not from the plains No sir but we re going there Then this is just the place for you Some of the boys here the proprietor jerked his head toward the men standing before the bar are getting ready to start and you can go with them The host deposited Leon s baggage behind the bar and when he came back after Frank s gun and valise the latter said Can t you show us to our room and take our luggage up there I can but there s all sorts of fellows stop here and you had better let me take care of your things I ll be responsible for them But we would like to perform our ablutions said Frank Which exclaimed the host We want a good wash explained Leon Oh Why didn t you say so There is the sink and plenty of towels and soap said the man nodding his head toward a corner of the room Pitch in as soon as you please With this remark the proprietor as if he considered that he had done his full duty toward his new guests returned to his place behind the bar CHAPTER XXIII A FRIENDLY HUNTER The boys walked up to the sink and took a survey of it It contained two tin basins Several pieces of hard soap were deposited upon a little shelf over it and the towels looked as though they had done service for weeks I have been used to better things than these said Frank who could hardly bring himself to touch one of the dingy basins So have I answered Leon but what s the good of growling When you get out to the mountains you ll have to wash your hands and face in a brook and dry them upon a piece of buckskin We ve got to rough it that s what we came out here for and we might as well begin now as a month later We ll get used to it by the time we are settled as hunters Frank told himself very emphatically that he never would be settled as a hunter He was heartily tired of roughing it already and would have been glad to start for home long ago but he knew by the way his cousin talked and acted that it would be of no use to propose such a thing so after a good deal of thinking he had determined upon a course of action that was mean and cowardly in the extreme He only waited for a favorable opportunity to carry his plans into execution After washing their hands and faces and drying them upon the cleanest part of the long used towels the boys looked around until they found a couple of chairs that had just been vacated and sat down to listen to the conversation of the miners who had by this time drawn away from the bar and were now seated around the stove talking over their experience They talked principally about gold hunting but presently one of them launched out into a narrative that held his listeners spellbound It was about a fight he and his comrades had with a war party of Cheyennes who drove them away from their diggings This set the others going on the same subject and from that hour until supper was announced the boys listened to stories of adventure and hair breadth escapes from wild animals and Indians that were enough to frighten anyone For the first time since leaving home Leon told himself that perhaps he had mistaken his calling If tall broad shouldered powerful looking men like these could be driven about like sheep by the wild inhabitants of the mountains and plains what could a boy like himself do in combat with them As for Frank the last particle of his courage oozed out at the ends of his fingers and he was all the more determined to carry out the plans he had already formed He found that he had entertained very erroneous opinions regarding frontier life The heroes of his favorite books could not only whip a dozen Indians very easily and come off without a scratch but they could go alone into a hostile camp and rescue a partner who had been captured by them Here were men however live men too who were willing to acknowledge that they had been whipped that they had seen quite enough of savage life and that they would be glad to reach home where they could live in peace Leon said Frank suddenly don t you think you had better give me half the money you ve got left You pay all the bills and that looks as though I was sponging on you Never mind that was the reply It s all in the family But what if somebody should go through you urged Frank I suppose there are pickpockets here as well as in the cities If you lost your share I d have mine left to fall back on But I don t intend that anybody shall go through me answered Leon I ll take good care of the money and pay your bills and mine too You had better keep close watch over it said Frank to himself for if I once get my hands on it I ll take enough of it to see me safely back to Boston I bet you Leon he added almost desperately I am tired of this Let s go back before it s too late We must go some time Ah ha exclaimed his cousin That s the reason you want half the money is it Well you can t have it It is all very well for you to talk about going home for you will go straight to Boston and none of your friends there will ever know that you ran away your folks of course won t say anything about it But if I go home I must go among those who know everything No sir I ll never see Eaton again until I have made a name for myself Frank seeing that he had made a mistake tried to turn the matter off with a laugh and hastened to assure his cousin that if he was still determined to go through he Frank would stand by him through thick and thin He hoped in this way to throw Leon off his guard so that the latter would relax his vigilance and give him a chance to steal what was left of the six hundred dollars for that was what he had determined to do We may add that he finally succeeded in his object and came very near getting himself into a desperate scrape by it When supper was announced the boys followed the crowd into an adjoining room and took the seats that were pointed out to them by their host It was not just such an apartment as that in which they had been accustomed to take their meals at home It was almost as dingy as the bar The rough tables were not very clean and the dishes and viands were scattered about without the least regard to order They looked Leon told himself as though the waiter had stood off and thrown them at the table and left them wherever they landed But there was plenty to eat and the boys being very hungry made a hearty supper When they had satisfied their appetites they went back to the bar room and sat down on one of the benches while the gold hunters smoked their pipes and told stories of life in the mines When eight o clock came Leon walked up to the bar and asked the landlord to show him and his cousin to their room In compliance with the request the man lighted a tallow candle and leading the boys up a narrow winding stairway ushered them into the most cheerless bedroom they had ever seen There was no carpet on the floor and there were no chairs on which to deposit their clothing In fact the room contained nothing except a couple of beds which looked as though the person who made them up must have been in a very great hurry You two tumble into this one said the landlord placing the candle on the floor and nodding his head toward one of the beds You needn t mind locking your door cause there s another fellow belongs up here Who is he asked Frank He s a hunter and a mighty good one too I reckon for he used to be post hunter at Fort Laramie Is he all right Is he exclaimed the landlord He s the best fellow in the world good natured he hasn t had but three fights since he s been here free hearted and spends his money like water He killed eight hundred buffalo this season and he s going back to kill some more You needn t mind putting out your candle cause he ll be up directly He always goes to bed early since he and his money quit Good night That s just the man we want to see exclaimed Leon when the landlord had left the room He can tell us everything we want to know and if he will let us we can t do better than go with him The boys had hardly got into bed Leon took the precaution to place his trousers which contained the money under his pillow when a heavy step sounded in the hall the door opened and the third occupant of the room stalked in He was roughly dressed and carried a knife and revolver in his belt The runaways who looked at him with great interest could not see much of his face for the lower part of it was concealed by thick bushy whiskers which looked as though they had never been combed and his slouch hat was drawn low over his forehead There was something forbidding about him but the boys could not have told what it was Hallo pilgrims said he as he placed his hands on his hips and looked down at the runaways Are you the kids who are going out on the plains Yes sir answered Leon Come from the States I reckon didn t you Yes sir and we re looking for somebody who can tell us just what we ought to do We re going out to the mountains to hunt and trap Do you think we can make a living at it Finest business in the world was the encouraging reply I know lots of fellows who are getting rich at it It s a trifle rough sometimes if you get into the Injuns hunting grounds but all you ve got to do is to grab your spelter and skip out I understand that you used to be post hunter at Fort Laramie said Frank Yes and I got kicked out cause me and the colonel couldn t hitch hosses replied the man cheerfully If he had said that he had been detected in an attempt to rob the sutler s drawer and had been obliged to leave the neighborhood of the fort in order to escape arrest he would have been nearer the truth Well we are green began Leon Yes I knowed you were tenderfeet interrupted the hunter And we want to find somebody of experience who will take us in charge and manage matters for us added Leon We don t know what kind of an outfit we want or where to go to find good hunting grounds Have you got any money Plenty of it answered Leon readily more than enough to foot all our O Frank what do you mean he added changing his tone very suddenly as his cousin s elbow was brought against his side with considerable force Frank made no reply and the hunter presently continued You don t want to let anybody coax you into spending much of it for an outfit in this place cause things is so dear All you want is a hoss saddle and bridle and a pair of saddle bags In the saddle bags you can carry a little bacon corn meal salt pepper coffee and sugar too if you want it as I reckon you do being tenderfeet Anything else you want to eat you can shoot as you go along When do you start for the fort To morrow Now why won t you let us go with you We ve got money and Again Frank s elbow came in vigorous contact with his cousin s ribs Then it began to creep through Leon s head that perhaps he was saying too much about his wealth so he resolved to take the hints Frank had given him and drop the subject I ll take care of you answered the hunter I was a tenderfoot myself once and would have been glad to have somebody do as much for me Leon drew a long breath and told himself that he had done a very sensible thing when he turned into the Prairie Hotel Here was a man who was an experienced hunter who was recommended by the landlord as being the best fellow in the world who knew just what they wanted and would assist in fitting them out for the plains Things could not have worked more to his liking The hunter had by this time extinguished the light and got into bed but he did not seem at all inclined to sleep He talked incessantly for three hours and kept the boys interested in what he had to say regarding a hunter and trapper s life During the progress of the conversation the boys learned that their friend s name was Eben Webster that he had left all his outfit except his horse at Laramie that he had come down to St Joe to rest after a hard season s work on the plains and that having seen enough of civilization for the present he was going to start back on the following morning He said he would pick out some saddle horses for the boys show them the way to the fort where he would secure the rest of their outfit for them and then he would lead them to the mountains where they would spend the rest of the winter together in hunting and trapping They were sure to have the best of luck for he knew right where to go to find plenty of game and if he didn t make good hunters of them before spring so that they could start on their own hook he would give them all the furs he caught Leon was highly excited over the prospect and it was a long time after the conversation ceased before he fell asleep CHAPTER XXIV ON THE TRAIL You re a pretty fellow you are This was the way in which Leon was greeted by his cousin the next morning when he awoke It was broad daylight The hunter had arisen at the first peep of day and the boys were alone in their room What s the matter now asked Leon as he sat up in bed pulled his trousers from under his pillow and thrust his hand into his pocket to make sure that his money was safe I haven t been doing anything No you haven t made a blunder this morning for you haven t had time but you made two fearful ones last night replied Frank What in the world induced you to tell that man that you had a pocketful of money He is a stranger to us and we don t know whether he is honest or not Perhaps I did talk a little too much said Leon reflectively But I wanted to give him to understand that if he would let us go with him we would be no expense to him Well another time don t be in such haste to take a person you don t know into your confidence Leon could make no defence so he said nothing He lay for a long time thinking over the conversation he and his cousin had had with the hunter the night before and there was one thing upon which he dwelt with no little satisfaction This new friend had not tried to turn them from their purpose On the contrary he had said all he could to encourage them If his statements were worthy of belief and Leon did not doubt them in the least a hunter s life was one of ease and romance and the only one that was all sunshine It was true that a hunter was sometimes in danger of his life but that was a matter of no moment in the opinion of Eben Webster It only served to put him on his mettle and to relieve the monotony of his existence Eben according to his own story was a typical hunter He was of the same stamp as those doughty heroes who figure so extensively in cheap novels He had time and again whipped all the hostile warriors that could get around him and as for bears and panthers he thought no more of shooting them than Leon did of bringing down a grouse or squirrel The boy could not help telling himself that Eben s stories differed widely from those to which he had listened in the bar room but still his faith in his new friend was not shaken He believed the latter because he pictured life in the mountains just as he hoped to find it It never occurred to him that the hunter had told him a pack of falsehoods but he found out afterward that such was the case The loud ringing of a bell at the foot of the stairs interrupted Leon s meditations and brought him and his cousin out upon the floor in a twinkling They dressed with all haste and descending to the bar room found the guests loitering about awaiting the call to breakfast Eben was there and he sat beside the boys at the table His tongue ran as rapidly as it had run the night before and among other things he told the boys that he had been busy that morning looking up a mount for them and had found just what they wanted A couple of gold hunters who were stopping at the hotel and were going to start for the States that day offered to sell the horses they had ridden from the mines for a mere song twenty dollars apiece including saddles bridles and saddle bags They can t be good for anything if they can be bought as cheap as that said Leon My father s horse cost six hundred dollars They re good enough to carry you to Laramie answered the hunter and when we get there you can trade em off to the Injuns for better ones What I want to make you understand is that you don t want to spend a cent more in this town than you are obliged to Things are so dear This was the burden of Eben s advice to the boys and he repeated it so often while they were purchasing their outfit that they began to wonder at it Perhaps we shall presently see why it was that the man was so anxious to have Leon take good care of his money Breakfast being over the miners who owned the horses were hunted up and Eben and the runaways accompanied them to the stable The animals were brought out for their inspection but the boys knew no more about them after they got through looking them over than they did before they saw them They were mustangs and although in very good condition they were by no means handsome and Frank did not hesitate to say so Handsome is that handsome does pilgrim said one of the miners These hosses have been through two or three fights with Injuns and if it hadn t been that they re just a trifle faster n chain lightning me and my partner wouldn t be here in St Joe to day If we wasn t going back to the States we wouldn t think of parting with em These words raised the mustangs wonderfully in Leon s estimation Without any further hesitation he pulled out his roll of bills and paid for them on the spot The roll was still a pretty large one although he had paid his own and his cousin s railroad and steamboat fare out of it It was large enough to make Eben s eyes grow to twice their usual size and if the boys had seen the expression that settled on his face and could have read the thoughts that passed through his mind it is possible that their own eyes would have been opened The horses having been purchased but little remained to be done and in an hour more the boys accompanied by the hunter were on their way to the plains Instead of their valise for which the landlord had generously allowed them a dollar on their bill the boys carried strapped behind their saddles two small meal bags which contained their clothing The saddle bags were filled with provisions that the hunter had selected for them and they were each provided with a lariat and picket pin for staking out their horses at night Eben had protested earnestly against the expenditure of money for blankets declaring that the boys heavy overcoats would afford them all the protection they needed at night but Frank declared that he had never read of a hunter lying before his fire wrapped in an overcoat and so the blankets were purchased The first few days passed without the occurrence of any incident that is worthy of note They travelled rapidly for Eben declared that haste was necessary It would not be many days he said before the cold winter storms would begin to sweep over the prairie in fact he had never known them to hold off so long before and if they were caught out in a blizzard nothing but certain death awaited them So he had the boys up every morning before daylight allowed them but a very short rest at noon and kept them in the saddle long after dark It is needless to say that not being accustomed to riding on horseback they suffered severely but the tireless mustangs on which they were mounted did not seem to mind it in the least They were as willing to go at nine o clock at night as they were in the morning During the first week the boys saw absolutely nothing along their line of travel for their time was fully occupied in trying to find an easy position in the saddle but their aches and pains gradually left them as they became hardened to it and then Leon began to take some interest in the new and strange sights that met his gaze on every side He was very jubilant Eben was talkative and Frank was frightened and homesick And the fact was he saw a good deal to frighten him Every mile of the road was marked by the bleaching bones of horses and cattle telling of disasters that had befallen some unfortunate emigrant and now and then the sight of a human grave or the ruins of a dug out would make the cold chills creep all over him There was a good deal of travel on the trail for that time of the year Every day they passed long lines of heavily loaded freight wagons and they in turn were passed by the coaches of the Overland Stage and Mail Company which drawn by four fleet horses and escorted by cavalrymen who galloped along on each side of them whisked by at the rate of ten miles an hour They also saw trains going the other way empty freight wagons which a few weeks before had gone out loaded with government stores and others driven by disgusted gold hunters and emigrants who were making all haste to reach the States The hunter always made it a point to travel rapidly whenever he and his companions met any of these returning wagons He took particular pains also when they began to think of stopping for the night to ride so far beyond any camp they might find on the trail that the boys could not go back to visit it He did not intend to allow his young companions an opportunity to converse with any of the emigrants for fear that they might hear something discouraging but in spite of all his precautions they learned something along the route which Eben himself had learned at a station near which they made their camp a few nights before but which he studiously kept from the boys One afternoon when they were about twenty miles from Julesburg and on their way toward Fort Laramie one of the mail coaches overtook them accompanied as usual by four cavalrymen As the coach dashed by the sergeant who commanded the escort drew up his horse with a jerk exclaiming Where bound pilgrims Fort Laramie replied Leon who was the first to speak Laramie echoed the sergeant You will never see it this year You ll do well if you get to Julesburg You want to keep up with us if you can because the reds have been jumping down on some of the coaches So saying the officer touched his horse with his spurs and galloped away in pursuit of the coach CHAPTER XXV FRANK STARTS FOR HOME The sergeant s words produced the utmost consternation among those who heard them The boys turned white with terror and cast anxious glances toward the surrounding swells momentarily expecting to see a band of hostile warriors rise over their summits and swoop down upon them Eben was alarmed too but he did not show it as plainly as his companions did There aint a word of truth in it he said I have been along this trail more n a hundred times and never saw no Injuns yet They wouldn t be roaming about the plains at this season of the year anyway They are up on the Big Horn getting ready for winter But what did the soldier mean when he said that we will do well if we reach Julesburg asked Frank in a trembling voice He meant that it was going to snow replied the hunter But I can read the signs like a book and I know it won t snow for a week yet But even if it does storm we don t care for we shall be in Julesburg to morrow With this answer Eben tried to turn the conversation into another channel but the boys being terribly frightened could talk about nothing but Indians and speculate upon their chances of reaching a place of safety The hunter stood it as long as he could and then said almost savagely If there were Injuns about you wouldn t see so many single wagons along the road The emigrants would wait for one another and make up a strong train so that they could defend themselves Leon who had all faith in the hunter was somewhat reassured by these words but Frank s terror increased every time he recalled the sergeant s warning Just before dark they passed a camp on the bank of a little stream and Frank urged Eben to stop there so that they could have company during the night but the hunter following his usual custom rode by at a gallop and as Leon went with him Frank had to follow or be left alone I can t stand this any longer and I won t either said Frank to himself as he galloped along behind his companions But after all I don t see how I am going to help myself I have waited and watched for an opportunity to get my hands on that money ever since we left St Joe and I haven t seen a ghost of a chance Frank was almost ready to cry with vexation and alarm He did not know what to do but as it happened a way was most unexpectedly opened for him to carry out his plans that very night Eben kept his horse in a gallop until the emigrant s camp was left at least five miles behind and then drawing rein in a little clump of willows announced that they would stop there until morning The weary boys swung themselves from their saddles and set about the performance of certain duties that had been assigned them when the journey first began Frank s business was to cut wood enough to keep the fire burning all night and although he appeared to work industriously he spent more than half his time in watching his cousin s movements He saw him take his saddle bags from his horse lift up the flap that covered one of the pockets and thrust his hand into the bag Then he placed the bags upon the ground near the spot on which the fire was to be built and piled his saddle blankets and overcoat upon them taking care to arrange all the articles in such a position that he could tell at a glance if any of them had been disturbed He has done that every noon and night for the last week soliloquized Frank and now I am satisfied that the money is in those saddle bags Mine look exactly like his and if I see a chance I ll exchange with him and leave I am sure I could find my way back to that emigrant s camp and perhaps I could induce him to let me ride in his wagon as far as St Joe The supper consisting of bacon and crackers which Leon had purchased at one of the mail stations was ready in due time and when it had been disposed of the travellers lay down beside the fire Eben on his soldier s overcoat and the boys on their blankets and talked themselves to sleep that is Leon and the hunter went to sleep but Frank kept wide awake He had no intention of closing his eyes that night Before lying down Leon had placed his saddle bags across his saddle in the same position they occupied when he was on horseback and the pocket which contained the money was under his shoulders while his head rested in the hollow of the saddle which he used as a pillow These precautions almost disheartened Frank who for six long hours lay there within easy reach of his cousin revolving in his mind various plans for obtaining possession of the coveted treasure Two or three times he reached out his hand and tried to pull the saddle bags from under Leon s shoulders but every time he did so Leon stirred in his sleep and Frank was obliged to desist He was almost ready to give up in despair when to his great joy his cousin in tossing about and trying to find a more comfortable position rolled partly off his rude bed Frank was prompt to seize upon the opportunity thus presented for it was now or never As quick as thought he drew the saddle bags toward him unbuckled the flap and plunged his hand in the pocket As he did so his fingers came in contact with something wrapped up in a piece of paper Hardly able to suppress the cry of exultation that arose to his lips he seized upon it and raising himself to his knees untied the paper with hands that trembled violently The fire which the hunter had replenished several times during the night was burning brightly and by the aid of the light it threw out Frank saw that he had found what he wanted The next thing was to leave the camp without arousing either of his companions Illustration FRANK STEALS THE MONEY Hastily buckling the flap he pushed the saddle bags back to their place and arose to his feet He spent a moment in arranging his blankets so that anyone who took a casual glance at them would believe that they covered a human form took his overcoat on his arm picked up his rifle and accoutrements which he had placed at the head of his bed and stole silently away into the darkness He walked a few rods with noiseless footsteps and then breaking into a run flew over the ground at a rate of speed he had never equalled before I ve got it I ve got it at last he kept whispering to himself and if I can only keep it I am sure of seeing home and friends once more I will keep it I ll fight till I drop before I ll give it up I am rather sorry that I had to take it all but I was afraid that if I stopped to divide it one or the other of them would wake up and discover me Well Leon stands in no need of it for he doesn t want to go home Besides he has Eben to take care of him while I must look out for myself The boy would have been greatly amazed if anyone had told him that the hunter had been laying his plans to do just what he Frank had done Eben never intended to guide the boys to Fort Laramie His object was to lead them into the wilderness beyond Julesburg where there were but few wagons to be met at that season of the year steal Leon s money and Frank s rifle and blankets and leave them to shift for themselves But Frank got the start of him and we shall see what the hunter did about it Frank very soon ran himself out of breath and was obliged to settle down into a walk Knowing that his absence would ere long be discovered and that an effort would be made to overtake him and recover the money he stopped frequently to listen for sounds of pursuit holding himself in readiness to leave the trail and seek a hiding place in the grass if he heard the sound of horses hoofs But Leon and the hunter still slept soundly and Frank went on his way unmolested The five miles that lay between his own camp and the camp of the emigrant seemed to have lengthened out wonderfully since Frank passed that way but just as the day was breaking he came within sight of the canvas cover of the wagon and saw the light of the camp fire shining through it Breaking into a run he dashed up to the wagon creating no little excitement among the emigrant s children who ran to their mother and clung to her dress for protection The woman looked up from her cooking the man who was harnessing his mules faced suddenly about and both stared at him as if to ask what he meant by his intrusion My friend said Frank speaking rapidly and keeping his gaze directed down the trail in the direction from which he had come will you do a favor for me Anything in reason was the encouraging reply Thank you said Frank gratefully Do you see this rifle It cost forty dollars in Boston I will give it to you if you will let me hide in your wagon and ride with you until we reach one of the mail stations I have a little money in my possession and am in danger of being robbed Mercy preserve us exclaimed the emigrant s wife You see continued Frank I started from St Joe intending to go to Fort Laramie but I have seen enough of this Western country and now I want to go home I don t blame you said the emigrant We want to go home too Then you can imagine how I should feel if I were robbed and left stranded here on the plains I assure you that if you will let me go with you and hide in your wagon until all danger is past At this moment Frank discovered something moving rapidly along the trail about half a mile away He looked closely at it and saw that it was a horseman who was urging his way forward at full speed That s Eben said he in a husky voice He is the man who wants to rob me Don t you believe a word he says to you If he asks you about me tell him that you haven t seen me So saying Frank sprang into the wagon and began covering himself up with the bedding that was scattered over the bottom In a second more he was concealed boots and all If we tell him that we ll be lying said the woman thoughtfully Well mebbe it would be stretching things just a little said the man slowly but in a case like this that s a mighty fine rifle of his n Jane and squirrels are plenty in Kaintuck And this rifle will bring them out of the tallest hickory in the woods said Frank sticking his head out from under the quilts for a moment and then drawing it hastily back again The emigrant once more turned his attention to his mules the woman went on with her preparations for breakfast and presently the horseman galloped up to the camp and drew rein CHAPTER XXVI EBEN SHOWS HIS COLORS Say pilgrim have you seen a boy dressed in store clothes and carrying a rifle in his hands pass along the trail this morning inquired the horseman The concealed runaway who had taken care to leave a little opening among the quilts so that he could hear all that was said trembled violently as the familiar tones fell upon his ear It was the hunter sure enough He held his breath in suspense while he waited for the emigrant s reply Nary boy drawled the man There aint nobody passed this camp since sundown last night Then he must have left the trail and taken to the grass said Eben I ve missed him somewhere but I ll find him if I have to hunt the whole country over Has he been a doing of anything I should say he had He stole over three hundred dollars out of my saddle bags early this morning The exclamations this statement called forth from the emigrant and his wife made Frank tremble again What if they should take it into their heads to believe Eben s story instead of his own The emigrant s next words however put him somewhat at his ease Well I aint seen him go past here said he What do you reckon you ll do with him if you ketch him The hunter did not answer the question in words He drew his revolver and held it off at arm s length as if he were taking aim at something at the same time digging his heels into the sides of his horse which sprang away at the top of his speed When Eben was out of sight the emigrant stepped upon the wagon tongue and called to Frank Look here neighbor he exclaimed that man says you robbed him How is that There isn t a word of truth in it replied Frank He never had his hands on the money I ve got in my pocket Did you take a good look at him Well now take a good look at me and make up your mind which of us you would rather believe There s something in that said the emigrant You look like an honest boy and I hope you be You d best stay in there a spell I reckon That feller may come back after a while and if he gets his eye on you I am afraid it will go hard with you I ll hand you in a bite to eat The emigrant stepped down from the wagon tongue and when he came back again he placed in Frank s hand a tin plate containing a piece of bacon and corn bread and a quart cup filled with coffee He and his family ate their breakfast while seated around the fire When the meal was over the mules were hitched to the wagon the woman and her children climbed in and the emigrant mounted his seat and drove off They had not been on the trail more than two hours before Frank who was constantly on the watch discovered Eben coming back The instant he caught sight of him he made a dash for his hiding place and the emigrant and his wife covered him up with the quilts There was no need of all this trouble however for the hunter never looked toward the wagon as he galloped by and only shook his head sullenly when the emigrant asked him if he had found the boy of whom he was in search Frank s adventures on the plains were now ended For a few hours he was extremely nervous and uneasy and always sought his hiding place whenever a horseman wearing a military overcoat made his appearance on the trail behind them but Eben was a good many miles away and it was a long time before Frank heard of him again He remained with the hospitable emigrant until they arrived at one of the stations of the Overland Stage Company and there he took leave of him and his family after presenting the man with his rifle according to promise and secured a seat in a coach bound for Atchison Having seen him fairly on his way toward home we will bid him good by for the present and return to Leon whom we left fast asleep on his blanket When Frank had been gone a little more than an hour and the first gray streaks of dawn were beginning to make their appearance in the east Eben suddenly sat up and looked about him After stretching his arms and yawning he arose and mended the fire and it was while he was thus engaged that he discovered Frank s bed was empty He looked toward the place where the horses were staked out and saw that they were all there but he noticed that Frank s rifle and overcoat were gone and his suspicions were aroused at once Stepping quickly to Leon s side he seized him by the shoulder and shook him roughly Pilgrim pilgrim he shouted in stentorian tones Wake up here That pardner o your n s skipped Leon was wide awake in an instant He looked toward Frank s bed and uttering an exclamation of alarm caught up his saddle bags unbuckled one of the flaps and thrust his hand into the pocket Everything that ought to have been there was there except the article of which he was in search He tumbled the contents of both pockets on the ground tossed them in all directions but the little round package wrapped in a piece of newspaper was not to be found It s gone gasped Leon his hands falling helplessly by his side You don t mean the money cried the hunter whose excitement was fully equal to Leon s Yes I do mean the money replied the boy who felt like yelling with indignation It beats me how he got it for I have kept a close watch over it ever since he told me that he wanted to go home There were more than three hundred dollars in that roll too The hunter muttered something that sounded very much like the heaviest kind of an imprecation You re a nice one to have money said he angrily Why didn t you keep it in your pocket Because I was afraid it would work out and get lost Where are you going said Leon as the hunter turned and ran toward his horse I m going to have that money back said Eben in savage tones He can t be far off for he hasn t been gone long enough to put many miles between him and us He was in his bed the last time I fixed the fire and fast asleep too for I saw him If I come up with him he ll never steal any more money I bet you Don t be too hard on him said Leon who did not like the expression he saw in his companion s face He is my cousin you know I don t care if he s the President s cousin We make short work of thieves in this country You stay and watch the camp until I come back Eben put the saddle and bridle on his horse in a remarkably short space of time and springing upon his back galloped away paying no heed to Leon s repeated request that he would not harm Frank if he succeeded in overtaking him I am really afraid that boy has got himself into a box thought Leon as he settled back on his hard bed I never saw a man in such a rage as Eben is He takes a good deal of interest in my affairs but I hope he ll not let his zeal carry him too far Frank has got me into a box too for if I should grow tired of life in the mountains and conclude to go back to the States how am I to get there The indignation Leon felt when he first discovered that his money had been stolen had given away to a feeling of uneasiness He was certain that Eben would overtake his cousin A boy on foot could not possibly escape from a man on horseback especially on the plains and if he would simply bring him back and hand over the three hundred dollars all would be well but he was afraid that the angry hunter might take it into his head to punish Frank in some way He felt the loss keenly but he was not troubled concerning the future Eben had told him that the traders who were located at the various posts during the winter were in the habit of furnishing supplies on credit to responsible hunters and trappers who would bind themselves to sell their furs to no one but the man of whom the supplies were obtained So the loss of his money would not prevent him and Eben from spending a few months in the mountains as they had intended to do But still he wanted funds to use in case of emergency and he hoped that Eben would succeed in overtaking Frank Leon did not cook any breakfast for he could not have eaten a mouthful if he had tried his anxiety and suspense were too great He spent four hours in walking back and forth between the camp fire and the trail and presently he saw Eben coming back The expression his face wore when he rode up made Leon afraid to speak to him It was evident that he had had his trouble for his pains While the boy was wondering how Frank could have effected his escape the hunter dismounted and walking over to the place where the two mustangs were staked out he cut the lariats with which they were confined and set them at liberty This done he hurried into the camp and without saying a word proceeded to gather up all the articles Frank had left behind as well as those belonging to Leon He picked up the saddle bags all the blankets the meal bags which contained the boys clothing and threw them across the neck of his horse After balancing them so that they would not fall off he came back and picked up Leon s double barrel and also the powder flask and shot pouch belonging to it What are you going to do asked the boy who had watched the singular movements with surprise not unmingled with alarm I am off for the mountains answered Eben in sullen tones I have the best notion in the world to knock you over before I go for not keeping that money in your pocket where it belonged But what are you taking my horse for If you are going to the mountains why can t I go with you The hunter made no reply He sprang upon the back of his own horse and galloped away followed by the liberated mustangs and leaving Leon standing beside the fire almost overwhelmed with astonishment and terror CHAPTER XXVII ALONE AND FRIENDLESS Leon who was by no means dull of comprehension had no difficulty in finding an explanation of the hunter s actions The latter had deliberately robbed and deserted the boy who had trusted him This conviction came upon Leon with stunning force and literally crushed him to the ground He fell down beside the fire and for a few moments gave way to the most violent grief Then suddenly recovering himself he sprang to his feet and ran swiftly down the trail shouting the hunter s name and imploring him to come back But Eben was out of hearing In a few seconds more he disappeared over a swell and Leon was alone on the prairie How he managed to exist during the next few hours he never knew He was animated with but one idea and that was to reach Julesburg in the shortest possible space of time He knew it was a military post and he hoped to find the hunter there If he did he would seek an interview with the commandant tell him his story and have the thief arrested But how much better off will I be then than I am now sobbed Leon after he had thought the matter over I shall get my property back of course but what use will it be to me I would not dare start for St Joe alone for there are Indians along the route and I have heard Eben say that it will not be long before the roads will be blocked with snow I suppose I might find a train of empty freight wagons going back but who will feed me when I have no money to pay for what I eat I can t become a hunter now that Eben has gone back on me and I Oh I wish I had never seen or heard of Frank Fuller I wouldn t be here now if he had stayed at home Leon ran until he was all out of breath and then slackened his speed to a walk He had heard the hunter say that the nearest post was only ten miles distant but the miles on the prairies are longer than they are in the States and it was past the middle of the afternoon when he came in sight of the little collection of tents and mud houses that bore the name of Julesburg He directed his course toward the stockade which stood on a hill a little apart from the town but when he came to the gate he paused for there was an armed sentinel pacing back and forth in front of it Do you allow strangers in here asked the boy timidly Yes if they come on business answered the sentry Leon replying that he had come on business and very important business too walked through the gate and paused to see which way he would go next He was surprised at the extent of the fortifications In the center was a parade ground large enough to admit of the evolutions of a regiment This parade ground was surrounded by broad level walks the space between the walks and the stockade being occupied with warehouses the sutler and trader s stores barracks officers quarters and stables all built of sun dried bricks A tall flag staff arose from the parade ground and from it floated the Stars and Stripes Leon could see nothing of Eben but he did see three or four men lounging in front of the open door of one of the buildings and toward them he bent his steps The building proved to be a stable and the men were government teamsters When they saw Leon approaching they ceased their conversation and looked at him with curiosity Good afternoon said the boy speaking in as steady a voice as he could command Do any of you happen to know a hunter named Eben Webster I reckon replied one of the men and we don t know nothing good of him neither Have you seen him about here to day asked Leon About here About this fort exclaimed another teamster Not much He ll never come through one of our gates unless he comes with a guard over him You don t want no dealings with him pilgrim He s a thief I know it replied Leon his lips quivering and his eyes filling with tears He stripped me of everything I had except the clothes I stand in and left me alone on the prairie The teamsters began to prick up their ears when they heard this and two or three of their companions who were at work in the stable came to the door to listen to the conversation Leon finding that he had an attentive audience began and told the story of his troubles hoping that if he could get the men interested they would assist him in some way He told nothing but the truth as far as he went but he omitted one very important thing which the wagon master an old gray headed man who had not yet spoken supplied for him after asking a few questions Have you got a father he asked Leon replied that he had And a mother too The boy nodded his head Then my young tenderfoot you re a runaway that s what you are No father or mother livin would let a kid like you come out here to make his bread and bacon by huntin and trappin You re a nice lad to talk about roughin it in the mountains aint you now Jest step over here longside of me and look at yourself The old wagon master spoke seriously and his words did not raise a laugh at Leon s expense as the latter expected they would He hung his head and it was all he could do to keep his tears from bursting out afresh One of the teamsters declared that it was a perfect shame and this remark brought about a general conversation during which Leon learned how foolish he had been in taking into his confidence a man with whom he was not acquainted Eben had never been post hunter at Laramie nor anywhere else He was nothing but a renegade who had married an Indian wife that he might share in the annuities that are yearly distributed among the different friendly tribes Leon was also informed that Eben had fled the country a few months before to escape arrest that he had never killed eight hundred buffaloes during all the years he had been on the plains and that he was too lazy and too big a coward to spend a winter in the mountains hunting and trapping He much preferred to settle down in his teepee and eat government rations As for the articles he had stolen the boy might just as well give them up for lost Eben had doubtless drawn a bee line for the place where the band to which he belonged was encamped and Leon would never see him again While this conversation was going on the wagon master arose and walked away He was gone but a few minutes and when he came back he beckoned to Leon who promptly joined him Pilgrim said he as they walked away together I wish I was your father for bout half an hour so t I could gin you a good trouncin to pay you for runnin away from a good home and comin out here where you aint got no sort of business in the world But seein I aint your father I m kinder sorry for you though you aint wuth no sorrer and I ve been sayin a good word to the trader for you I heard him tell one of the leftenants last night that he reckoned he d have to send to the States for a boy to help him take care on the store You see his last clerk growin tired of stayin here stole some money of his n and put for home Now mebbe you can work yourself into his place Leon s thanks were cut short by their arrival at the door of the trader s store He followed the wagon master in and was presented to a rough looking man who stood behind the counter A long conversation followed and when Leon was asked to tell his story he omitted nothing The trader scanned him closely and finally inquired Can you keep a set of books Yes sir replied Leon Either by single or double entry Now I don t want to hear no more about double entry exclaimed the trader growing red in the face and dashing his clenched hand upon the counter That s the way my last clerk kept my books and a nice mess he made of it He swindled me out of five hundred or a thousand dollars There s the books just as he left them added the trader waving his hand toward the desk and I can t make head nor tail of them Let me try said Leon Are you honest Well I ll tell you what I am willing to do I will come here on trial if you will take me and you can withhold my wages whatever they are If you see anything wrong about me you need not pay me a cent That s a fair proposition said the trader Hang up your overcoat somewhere and come around here Leon paused long enough to thank the kind hearted wagon master for the assistance he had rendered him and then taking his stand behind the desk set manfully to work to earn the money that was to pay his way back to the States That was all he had in his mind now His ambition to become a hunter was dead and buried out of sight All the rest of the day and until twelve o clock that night the trader and his new clerk stood at the desk trying to straighten out the accounts which Leon found to be in the greatest confusion And we may add that his mind was in great confusion too The sudden blighting of his long cherished hopes seemed to have stunned him and that strange malady homesickness from which Frank had suffered actually ever since leaving Albany assailed him with the greatest fury Frank had not given way to it for he had been buoyed up by the thought that if he could only secure his cousin s money he could at once turn his face toward Boston but Leon had absolutely nothing to encourage him While they were at work the trader casually remarked that he had paid his former clerk twenty dollars a month and board and when Leon thought of the long months he must spend in that dreary place before he could save enough to take him back to Eaton he felt like crying out in despair I can t stand it I can t stand it sobbed the repentant runaway as he tossed about on his hard bed in the little room off the store that had been occupied by his predecessor I shall die I know I shall Oh mother if I could only see you just one minute Leon s grief was so intense that he seemed to be on the point of suffocating He threw open the door of the room and walked the floor until he was almost exhausted but when he went to bed again he did not sleep and neither did he get up to open the store at six o clock as his employer had told him to do He was too ill to hold up his head The trader opened the store himself and after holding a few minutes conversation with his clerk walked across the parade ground and entered the doctor s office Returning to his store he found there a party of teamsters who were waiting for him While he was attending to their wants the hospital steward entered and went into Leon s room He stayed there about a quarter of an hour and when he came out the trader was alone What s the matter with that boy he asked Nostalgia and I suppose that is one of the worst things a poor mortal can be afflicted with replied the steward I have known it to throw every raw recruit in a battalion flat on his back Jerusalem cried the trader his face betraying the greatest consternation Is it as bad as that He did not understand the learned term which the steward had applied to Leon s malady but believing that a disease that bore a name like that must of necessity be something dreadful he was very badly frightened If there was any one thing of which he stood in the most abject fear it was contagion He had had some experience with it during his life among the Indians The steward who seemed somewhat surprised at the trader s words and actions replied Yes he is a pretty sick boy He has told me his story and I m going to speak to the doctor about him at once He ought to be shipped back to the States with as little delay as possible The steward went out and the trader paced up and down behind his counter in a state of mind bordering on frenzy If I ever befriend a vagabond again may I be shot said he He must be got out of here at once for I might catch it myself It is a pretty rough thing to do he added as he hurried toward Leon s door but self preservation is the first law of nature Say pilgrim he shouted as he entered the room where his clerk lay tossing and moaning on his bed you climb out o that and waltz Sir said Leon faintly Sir yelled the trader Get up and clear out Do you understand that Oh yes I understand it but what have I done I couldn t possibly get up I couldn t stand You must and you will roared the trader flourishing his fists in the air The steward says you ought to be kicked out of the fort directly and that shows you ve got something that s catching Now you get up and dust Start this minute or I ll take you by the collar and drag you out This threat put a little life and energy into Leon He arose to his feet and although he was so weak that he could scarcely maintain an upright position he succeeded in putting on his clothes Then he picked up his overcoat and staggered through the store and out at the door the trader shouting after him Now you go over to the other side of the fort and stay there Don t let me catch you on this part of the parade ground again Poor Leon All his hopes of seeing home and friends again were gone now CHAPTER XXVIII A FAMILIAR FACE Leon made the best of his way across the parade ground and threw himself helplessly down upon the steps of a warehouse He was so ill and so utterly discouraged that he almost wished he might die then and there and so bring his sufferings to an end He sat with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands looking the very picture of misery His gaze being directed toward the gate through which he had entered the day before he did not fail to see the neatly dressed young civilian who walked briskly up the hill and stopped to speak to the sentry At the sight of him Leon started up and even attempted to get upon his feet but he was so weak that he fell back upon the steps again I thought at first it was Oscar Preston said he He looks like him walks like him and dresses like him How much good the sight of one familiar face would do me I wish I was at Oscar s side this minute I tell you it wouldn t take me long to get home Corporal of the guard number seven shouted the sentry As Leon wearily raised his head he saw the corporal come out of the barracks in response to the call and hasten toward the gate He exchanged a few words with the visitor after which he conducted him along the path toward where Leon was sitting Again the boy raised his head his eyes opened to their widest extent his under jaw dropped downward he trembled in every limb He staggered to his feet winked hard to clear away something that seemed to be obstructing his vision and when he looked toward the visitor again he and the corporal were just disappearing through the door of the colonel s quarters That s Oscar Preston if I ever saw him panted Leon but what brought him out here Did my father send him after me No that can t be for he did not know where Frank and I were going Leon picked up his overcoat which was as heavy a load as he wanted to carry now and moving slowly along the path seated himself upon the threshold of the first door below the colonel s quarters intending to wait there until the visitor came out again He would have a good view of his face as he passed and then he would know whether or not he had been mistaken in regard to his identity At the end of half an hour it seemed an age to the impatient runaway a door opened in the commandant s quarters voices sounded in the hall and presently the visitor came out accompanied by the colonel the post surgeon and several subordinate officers They walked leisurely down the path conversing gayly and Leon s heart seemed to stop beating when he heard the colonel say Mr Preston when you write to the professor give him my kindest regards and assure him that I will do all in my power to assist you Hallo here he added in a very different tone of voice as a pale and trembling figure arose from a door step close at his side Who are you Leon could not reply He covered his face with his hands and tottered as if he were about to fall but Oscar for it was he who was struck motionless and dumb with astonishment recovered himself in time to spring forward and catch the runaway in his arms Leon Leon he exclaimed in a voice that was husky with emotion is this you Look up and speak to me But Leon s sobs effectually choked his utterance Supporting him with one arm Oscar forcibly drew away his hands and was amazed at the sight of the pale and sunken face which rested on his shoulder It is Leon as sure as the world cried Oscar who was almost beside himself with excitement Doctor this is a friend and schoolmate of mine and he is sick Won t you do something for him Did you call him Leon asked the surgeon stepping up and putting his hand under the boy s arm Then he must be that runaway my steward was telling me about Ah he added as Oscar nodded his head to him If that s the case you can do more for him than I can Leon was at once assisted into the surgeon s quarters and placed on a sofa The doctor felt his pulse while Oscar knelt beside him and rested his arm over Leon s shoulder as if to assure him of protection What s the matter with him sir he asked Oh I ve got something that s catching sobbed Leon and I m to be kicked out of the fort The trader told me so He wouldn t let me stay about where he was Oscar and the surgeon looked at each other in surprise and the latter said Why my young friend you re homesick There s nothing else the matter with you But that s bad enough said Leon who was nevertheless greatly encouraged I shall never see my home again Yes you will exclaimed Oscar You can start to morrow if you are strong enough to sit on a stage coach There said the surgeon That assurance will do him more good than all the medicine in the dispensary Sit down and talk to him he added handing Oscar a chair I ll give him a tonic and go out for half an hour He will be all right at the end of that time When the surgeon had seen Leon swallow the medicine he prepared for him he left the room and Oscar drew his chair up beside the sofa and sat down Leon pinched himself to make sure that he was not dreaming and then took Oscar s hand in his own and clung to it as if he were afraid that his friend might vanish into thin air Oscar said he I don t deserve this treatment at your hands Yes you do replied Oscar cheerfully I shall do all I can for you and then I shall not begin to cancel the debt I owe your father But you don t owe me anything but ill will It was I who shot Bugle I know it but you didn t hurt him You only made him angry Now drop that it is all forgotten and tell me what in the world brought you to the plains If I had met my own mother in the fort I certainly could not have been more surprised I came out to be a hunter confessed Leon You did So did I It was now Leon s turn to be astonished Yes sir continued Oscar I expect to make my living for years to come by hunting I am sent out here to procure specimens for the museum connected with the Yarmouth University Well sighed Leon after thinking a moment your way of becoming a hunter is better than mine Tell me your story from beginning to end said Oscar and then I ll tell you all about myself We know the story of Leon s adventures and mishaps so we will not repeat what he said to Oscar We know everything that happened to Oscar too up to the time he left Sam Hynes at his mother s gate on the night he returned from Yarmouth We dropped the thread of his narrative there and will now go back and take it up Oscar s mother you may be sure was overjoyed to see him The letters she had received from him during his absence had prepared her for a portion of the story he had to tell but there were also some things for which she was not prepared because the boy had had no time to write about them I was never so surprised in my life as I was this morning said Oscar after he had told of his reception and experience at the university The committee invited me into their room and gave me a check for sixteen hundred dollars There it is The thousand dollars I am to use in paying my expenses and the rest belongs to me I shall leave it all with you with the exception of a hundred dollars which I shall need to buy an outfit so you will be well provided for during my absence O Oscar exclaimed Mrs Preston I don t see how I can consent to this You will be so far away from home and among strangers But I shan t be among strangers either interrupted Oscar handing his mother a package of papers which he drew from the inside pocket of his coat There are my credentials my instructions which tell me just where to go and what to do and letters of introduction to high government officers both civil and military You see Professor Kendall he is the geologist you know has taken two parties of students out to the plains and during his excursions he made the acquaintance of these officers who gave him every assistance These letters will bring me the same aid and comfort The professor is going to take another party out there next summer and I am going to arrange matters so that they can camp with me for a few days The conversation was kept up until midnight and when Oscar went to bed he had the satisfaction of knowing that although his mother could hardly bear the thought of so long a separation she would adhere to her promise and throw no obstacles in his way He set about making preparations for the journey as soon as he arose the next morning and when Monday came he was all ready to start His friend Sam who went around looking as though he had lost everything on earth that was worth living for was with him night and day and accompanied him when he went to say good by to his friends Early on Monday morning the omnibus drew up before the door Oscar assisted the driver to carry out his trunk and then went back to take leave of his mother This was by no means an easy thing to do and when he came out he held his handkerchief to his face The only other passenger was Sam Hynes who did not speak to or even look at him although Oscar walked to the forward end of the vehicle where his friend was sitting and took a seat by his side He resolutely kept his back turned and looked steadily out of the window until they reached the depot then he jumped up wrung Oscar s hand for a moment and started for the door Say good by Sam and tell me that you wish me success cried Oscar But Sam did not act as though he heard him He dashed open the door and sprang to the ground and hurried away There was a large company of schoolboys assembled on the platform to see Oscar off and if he had stopped to shake all the hands that were stretched out to him he would have been obliged to wait for the next train He sprang upon the steps of the nearest car as the train was moving off waved his cap to the boys and looked around for Sam Hynes Presently he discovered that young gentleman far up the street striding along with his hands in his pockets and his chin resting on his breast Good luck to you Sam wherever you go and whatever you do said Oscar while a big lump of something seemed to be rising in his throat You re the best friend any fellow ever had Oscar stopped one day in St Louis to make a few purchases and then went on to Atchison where he took the stage for Julesburg He arrived there on time ate a hearty breakfast and leaving his luggage at the station walked up to the fort to present his letters of introduction to the commandant and surgeon The reception these gentlemen extended to him was all he could have desired They were astonished that a boy like himself should have been selected for so arduous and dangerous a mission but they entered heartily into the spirit of the matter and promised to assist him in every way We have seen that Oscar s arrival was most opportune Had he delayed his coming a few days longer there is no telling what would have become of Leon Parker Oscar spent the afternoon in writing long letters to his mother and Sam The one intended for Sam which was marked confidential contained a full history of Leon s adventures and wound up with the request that Sam for the sake of the friendship he bore the writer would take Leon under his protection Oscar hoped in this way to make things smooth for Leon There were mean boys in Eaton as there are everywhere but they would not be likely to say much to Leon about running away from home when they found he had a friend in such a heavy hitter as Sam Hynes was known to be The two boys took their meals with the officers mess and slept at the surgeon s quarters that night Leon s recovery was wonderfully rapid as the doctor said it would be but he was not yet himself by any means What would his father and his acquaintances in Eaton say to him when he reached home was the question that worried and haunted him continually Oscar said all he could to cheer him and the next morning he placed in his hands a sum of money sufficient to bear all his expenses and accompanied him to the station The coach arrived in time and the runaway after shaking Oscar warmly by the hand and thanking him over and over again for his kindness climbed to a seat on the top and in five minutes more was whirled away out of sight CHAPTER XXIX A VOICE FROM THE SNOW DRIFT It was a clear cold afternoon in February School had just been dismissed and among those who came down the stairs and paused to put on their gloves and pull the collars of their overcoats about their ears before venturing out into the frosty air were Sam Hynes and Leon Parker These two were often seen together now and we may add that the former had twice been kept after school since Leon came home and reprimanded for fighting But Sam declared that he had never had a fight in his life Perhaps he hadn t but it is nevertheless true that he had shaken one boy until every tooth in his head rattled and washed another s face in the snow It is hard to tell what Oscar would have thought if he had known how faithfully Sam was carrying out his wishes The two boys walked together until they arrived at Mrs Preston s house and there they separated one turning in at the gate and the other keeping on his way toward home Sam followed by Bugle who came out to meet him went into the woodshed and proceeded to fill his arms with stove wood This done he walked into the kitchen without ceremony and deposited the wood in the box Mrs Preston hearing the racket he made came out to see who was there Now Sammy said she I wish you wouldn t put yourself to so much trouble No trouble at all answered Sam I happened to pass through the woodshed and thought I wouldn t come in empty handed Heard anything from Oscar lately No I haven t and I begin to feel very uneasy No use feeling uneasy said Sam cheerfully They have had some hard storms out there and of course the roads are blocked When the letters do come they ll come in a bunch While Sam was speaking he was looking about the room and seeing that the water bucket was empty he went out and filled it at the pump Mrs Preston again protested but Sam silenced her by declaring that he happened to be thirsty and didn t know any easier way to get a drink It was a singular fact that somehow Sam always happened to pass through the woodshed about the time the box was empty and the kindling wood getting low and that he always happened to be thirsty when he came out of school and the water bucket had to be filled Mrs Preston had not lived alone since Oscar s departure She had two young lady boarders for company and as Sam had a way of dropping in and saying something cheerful just at the time when she was growing downhearted and longed to see Oscar she managed to keep up pretty good spirits Sam always brought sunshine with him and the lonely mother felt the better for his visits Having satisfied himself that there was nothing else he could do Sam departed with the remark that he might happen around to the post office that evening and if he did he would bring up Mrs Preston s mail should there chance to be any He went there as straight as he could go and to his great delight three letters addressed to Mrs Preston in Oscar s well known hand were pushed out to him With the muttered threat that if he did not find at least one letter for himself from the same source somebody would hear from him he walked to the other end of the office and looked into his father s box It happened that there were two for him and so Oscar escaped a blowing up One of the letters was bulky it took three stamps to bring it through and the other was much smaller I ll read the mean little one first thought Sam as he tore open the envelope after putting the other letters into his pocket and save the best for the last Sam took the letter out of the envelope and read it as he walked along that is he read a few lines near the end of it Then he stopped and stood motionless for a few moments looking the very picture of astonishment Suddenly arousing himself he crammed the letter back into the envelope jumped up and knocked his heels together at the same time uttering a suppressed whoop and started off at a rapid run The longer he ran the faster he ran and the consequence was that when he reached Mrs Preston s house he was nearly out of breath I ve got three letters for you he exclaimed as he burst into the sitting room There they are And you have run all the way from the office said Mrs Preston Yes m This cold weather makes one pretty lively Sam banged the door again and set off at the top of his speed He ran past his father s house and mounting the steps that led to Mr Chamberlain s door rang the bell furiously The summons was answered by the principal who looked at the boy in great surprise Oscar has gone and done it sure enough exclaimed Sam who was so full of news and so eager to communicate it that he couldn t wait to be questioned You remember the last evening but one that we spent with you do you not You asked Oscar if he would have the courage to hunt the savage animals we were talking about Well he has and he has proved himself a hero too I just got the letter out of the office and brought it around here thinking that perhaps you would like to hear it Certainly I would answered the principal It was very kind and thoughtful of you Sit down While Sam was talking he and the principal had been walking along the hall and now turned into the library The boy taking the seat pointed out to him slammed his cap down upon the floor drew Oscar s letter from his pocket and read as follows CAMP IN THE FOOT HILLS January DEAR SAM I wrote you a long letter last week I know you haven t received it yet for it is at this very moment lying snugly stowed away in one of the pockets of my saddle bags but I want to write just a few lines more for I have something to tell you I have but a very few minutes to tell it in because my guide is getting ready to make another attempt to reach the fort He tried a few days ago but the snow was so deep and soft that he was obliged to turn back before he had gone five miles He has made a pair of snow shoes since then and will travel on them until he strikes the prairie where he hopes to find the snow all blown off the trail I tell you Sam you don t know anything about storms or snow or drifts in Eaton You ought to be here now and I really wish you were for I hardly know what I shall do with myself while my guide is gone Of course I might hunt but I think I shall be safer in camp I saw something the other day and since then I have lost some of my enthusiasm The valley in which our camp is located is so effectually protected that there is very little snow in it and I have been able to go shooting every day I have secured a very fine pair of mule deer called black tails out here but although I have shot sixteen elk I have not yet found a specimen the horns not being as perfect as I wish they were I have stalked one old fellow who carries a magnificent pair of antlers more than a dozen times making use of all the caution and skill I was master of but he has always been too smart for me I have a rod in pickle for him however and in my next letter I shall tell you that I have got him But if I have failed in one thing I have been remarkably successful in another Give me a good grip and shake old fellow and then go and look at that skin hanging up there A black bear No sir You never saw one of that species with claws eight inches long It s a grizzly and my guide says he never in his life saw but one larger I killed him myself with a single bullet How I did it or how I had the courage to shoot at him at all I can t tell for the life of me It seems more like a dream than a reality He was close upon my guide who had wounded him and could not run fast enough to get out of his way and in a minute more there would have been sad work in that little grove of scrub oaks had it not been for my lucky snap shot which broke the bear s neck I don t hunt alone any more and now you know the reason why Sam not a word to mother about this While I shall keep you posted in everything I shall be careful what I write to her Don t mention it to anybody who will be likely to repeat it But my guide is ready and waiting I am going to see him a mile or two on his way and won t I be lonely when I come back to camp Remember me to all my friends in Eaton pat Bugle for me and believe me as ever Faithfully yours OSCAR PRESTON THE END THE FAMOUS CASTLEMON BOOKS BY HARRY CASTLEMON Illustration Specimen Cover of the Gunboat Series No author of the present day has become a greater
