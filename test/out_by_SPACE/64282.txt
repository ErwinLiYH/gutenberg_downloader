twenty five years ago Pedro Gonzola bought that handsome brown stone residence at the corner of Twelfth Street and Fifth Avenue and presented it to his bride on their wedding day As the name implied they were of Spanish origin and known as devout Catholics supporting the Church spiritually and materially Shortly before Julie was born her father died suddenly stricken down with heart failure The young widow was stunned by the loss of her handsome adoring husband her uncontrollable grief nearly cost her the life of her coming child who suffered from her mother s anguish at least that s what the good Dr McClaren said After her great misfortune Mrs Gonzola gave up the world and devoted herself to her religion and the care of her little daughter Julie was sent to the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Seventeenth Street The Sisters educated her under the personal supervision of her mother their reports were satisfactory the child was docile and receptive but inclined to emotional exaggeration she would remain in the chapel long after the other children had left and once they found her prostrate before the Virgin in a state of ecstatic self oblivion which ended in a fit of hysteria There was no cause for worry as otherwise she was full of life and a general favorite Mrs Gonzola tried conscientiously to impress her daughter with the dignity of her wealth social position and family distinction but as the girl grew into a woman there was an ever present irritating sense of failure Julie Gonzola at sixteen with her brilliant exotic beauty was a mystery to her friends her mother herself She was acutely conscious of strange emotions which she instinctively concealed hers was a nature of unexpected impulses tragic possibilities baffling secrets She came of an old stock on her father s side and on her mother s she could look down a long corridor where she saw shadowy forms which frightened her She was different from her girl friend who was care free bubbling sparkling dashing along like a brook which overflows its bounds out of sheer rapture Maud Ailsworth lived down the street There were no complications in her life She ruled her mother who was an invalid and physically her inferior Maud romped all day long in the street with the boys Mrs Gonzola never allowed Julie to do that she was very indulgent in her way denying the girl nothing but freedom Julie was outwardly submissive she was sorry for her mother who sat alone in her room crying silent iron tears of impotent despair There were two boys in the street whom Maud liked as she grew older she determined to marry one of them but she found to her great disappointment they were both hot after Julie Floyd Garrison a pretty boy of an old American family was very well brought up Martin Steele was a mongrel a brute a ruffian but there was something very likable about him Maud looked on watched them wrestling for the privilege of carrying Julie s books when she came from school with her maid There were fist fights for her as children rivalry as youths and bitterness as men But Maud wasn t discouraged Julie couldn t marry both of them there would be always one left for her Then she had Tom Dillon in reserve he was common but she owned him he was her slave Julie was afraid of Martin Steele he had bad manners and a violent temper He was always mussing up her hair and winding her curls around his fingers Floyd was too polite to do that There was a party at Maud Ailsworth s Tom Dillon that mischievous imp put out the lights The boy next to Julie kissed her pressing her to him with terrible force it was Martin After that he kissed her whenever he found her alone and he managed it often She liked his hot unboyish kisses The Garrisons had lived four generations in a little wooden house in East Twelfth Street a very pretty shanty Martin called it set back with a garden and a wooden fence to protect the lawn and flowers from passing vandals A portrait of the ancestor who founded the family fortune hangs today in our Museum Yan Geritsen baker endowed with business sagacity bought land under water in New Amsterdam for thirty cents left it to his son with orders not to sell Succeeding generations drained and developed it The name smelt of newly baked bread it gradually evolved itself into Garrison They were one of the fast disappearing families who remained as they began modest and thankful They brought up their son with a sense of responsibility as trustee for the coming son There were no girls as far back as could be remembered each family branch had one son Floyd s father Jimmy Garrison married a school marm He became acquainted with her in Boston She was very poor but descended from the Aldens Prudence Alden was a pale silent girl with a hidden fountain of irrepressible love in all its rare purity Young Garrison s friends couldn t see what he saw in her Garrison had never been in business he disliked the everlasting talk about money which was rapidly becoming God under the title of the Almighty dollar He had many acquaintances and one faithful friend Colonel Garland a Southern gentleman who had made a reputation up North as a corporation lawyer when trusts were springing up over night like toadstools The Colonel retained his sombrero his soft accent his passionate devotion to a few friends and many women When Jimmy Garrison put the administration of his estate into Colonel Garland s hands it was intact just as his father had left it Let us pull down those old hulks and build up warehouses said the Colonel Garrison refused to consider that The estate was not bought yesterday for speculation It has always brought us enough to live on modestly and something over if I get four per cent I m well satisfied In time modern buildings were erected on both sides of the Garrison hulks which although kept clean and in repair had to be rented below the market value Conservative policy has its good side many went under in the frenzy of over building In such a young country the cult of silence material rest creative thought were as yet unknown the man who did not create capital was considered an idler Garrison continued to the end of his peaceful worryless life a gentleman The first realization of pain was the sudden death of his beloved Prudence he had to live for his boy and looked about seeking a sustaining force He rigged up a workshop in the top of his house and took to modeling figures which were very well done every day people he had known the little Italian shoe boy the newspaper woman his friends idealized of course his wife in every mood his boy He was particularly successful with a smiling old Irishman a pipe in his mouth a hod on his shoulder standing at the foot of a ladder looking upward He called that figure the Ancestor which title was a secret source of amusement to him although he was too good natured to say whose ancestor When asked the inevitable question What business are you in Mr Garrison Garrison would answer gravely I muddle in clay The Steeles lived next door to the Garrisons in an ugly high stoop four story brick mansion which threw a dark shadow on one side of the little garden necessitating Garrison to move his flower beds away Martin was five years older than Floyd and twenty years more experienced He loved Floyd in his way but love was not an element of his nature Floyd looked up to him as a little boy would to an elder one who condescended to be his friend he was sorry for Martin because Mrs Steele was only his stepmother that was what was wrong with him he never had a real mother Mrs Steele was born Dolly Winthrop of Boston she was very tall very thin very straight with small transparent ears lying flat against her head The only large thing about her was her flow of language that was tremendous Mrs Steele s family tree reposed on the parlor table in a red velvet album reposed is a very inappropriate word for she never gave the poor thing any rest She was constantly turning over its pages adding multiplying never subtracting until it fell quite to pieces but she convinced the old New Yorkers of her right to be one of them The exclusives of Massachusetts never forgave Dolly Winthrop s marriage with that Steele man who was fat florid wordless and a widower with a child There were still spots in the Union where pedigree and culture were of more value than money but Dolly Winthrop had made her calculation and it turned out a good bargain Her husband and his father devoted all their time to business they accumulated great wealth and were not perceptible in her richly woven society tapestry There was one she couldn t wipe out that terrible boy Martin She tried honestly to make something of him but he was not to be moulded She took him to her summer home in Nantucket The Winthrop Homestead had ship lamps a model of the Mayflower clocks that struck bells numbered hours were disdained there were also stuffed seagulls which Martin set up as skittles and a tottering old sailor who took care of the garden and gave the necessary atmosphere Aunt Priscilla Mrs Steele s maiden sister lived there all the year In Nantucket Martin s capacity of hatred found fertile soil for expansion he hated the ocean its unceasing roar fretted him he thought of a big sea monster in chains writhing howling foaming at the mouth He hated Aunt Priscilla who was Calvinist Puritan Patriot anti everything else She took unusual pains to enlighten the little savage about the distinguished pedigree of his stepmother s family One day she read to him for three hours in her correct English twang the history of those good old Colonial times when her direct ancestor was a Judge in Salem The boy s eyes took on a glitter which meant mischief I d like to be a Judge in them times You mean you d like to have been a Judge in those times corrected Aunt Priscilla Have been mumbled the boy Aunt Priscilla was delighted at last she had awakened the pride of ancestry in that little soul Now tell me dear what would you have done if you had been a Judge in Salem I d burn you One day Floyd found out there was a mystery on the top floor of the Steele house it was Martin s fourteenth birthday He invited Floyd to ice cream and cake Julie Gonzola was coming There was plenty to eat but Floyd lost his appetite looking at little Julie sitting up on a high chair with all the best things piled before her She let Martin pile them but she didn t touch them she couldn t in a strange house Toward evening the maid came to take her home The two boys stood at the window as she went past enveloped in white furs her little feet stepping out firmly her head erect Martin s eyes snapped I m going to marry Julie Not if I know it Martin turned and swept the boy with a cold disdain terrible in one so young It hurt Floyd he remembered that look years after He said nothing but turned to go Martin stopped him Stay with me I m lonesome There was a touch of pathos in his voice Come I ll show you some family relics He led the way to the garret four stories high it was filled with old furniture spinning wheels oil paintings some wretchedly bad others fairly good all with heavy gold frames every piece was ticketed with a name and date in the different generations of the family Then Martin became confidential I ll tell you something but don t mention it to my mother These things are all fakes she haunts the auction sales she s a good judge she knows what fits in she s got a whole lot more in storage We re going to move away from here Floyd got a chill What You were born here You will never leave your home Martin s mocking laugh rang out Oh you re too sentimental She s not going to sell the house that wouldn t look well She s going to fill it with our family antiques and donate it to the city as an Art Museum Floyd was struck silent as usual by Martin s terrible lack of heart What s that What Somebody singing Martin looked troubled Nonsense there s nobody up here Let s go down He drew Floyd into the hall there was a door opposite It was somebody singing a man s voice broken harsh rising and falling in a strange inflection Martin with a look of fear mingled with shame tried to draw Floyd downstairs A heavy fist on the door pushed it open A man of gigantic stature rushed out At first glance Floyd saw only a pair of wonderful mocking eyes Martin s eyes there was a strange light in them The man was mad Martin sprang at him tried to push him back into the room He was too strong for the boy Then Martin coaxed him Was that Martin s voice so loving so sweet He spoke in a foreign tongue strange to Floyd The old man looked curiously at Floyd then said Grutsie and bowed respectfully He learnt afterwards Grutsie was Swiss dialect for I greet you The man had huge hands knotty sun dried the open flannel shirt revealed a chest covered with thick hair He had an enormous head and a thick white mane falling over his eyes He wore corduroy trousers to the knees and a pair of high deerskin boots with heavy nails in the soles He paced unceasingly The floor was covered with indentures Martin shut the door carefully took down a harness with bells which hung on the wall threw it over the old man s head cracking a heavy whip yelling at the top of his voice lashing him with sharp quick blows The old man growled like a beaten beast the whip hurt him the young devil was strong in the sensual intoxication of brute force they forgot the horrified boy looking on The door was flung open Mrs Steele stood there deathly pale Stop that noise you ll rouse the neighbors how dare you bring Floyd up here She grasped Martin s hand pushing him toward the door The old man slunk into a corner he was evidently afraid of her Let me go roared Martin I won t You ll be punished for this Then a struggle followed Floyd never forgot it She held him with her small strong hands he bit them She struck him across the mouth he kicked her She cried out with pain but she held him fast Floyd with a terrified cry rushed down the stairs and out of the house Mr Garrison was working at his clay figures thinking how much Floyd was growing like his mother he had her sensitive ideal nature The boy s love for Julie might be a great blessing it might be the contrary He would like to live long enough to see that beautiful little girl a woman Floyd broke into the room sobbing out what he had seen Mr Garrison quieted him and told him the story of the Steele family as he had it from his friend Colonel Garland The old man in the garret was Martin s grandfather a Swiss peasant who had come to America in the steerage with his boy a child of four He obtained a position as waiter in a downtown cafe and the boy grew up in the streets In ten years the father was head waiter in a Fifth Avenue hotel frequented by Wall Street men He never spoke more than a waiter s English His boy came out of school with a correct knowledge of grammar but was silent uncouth unfriendly Waiting for his father one night in the kitchen of the hotel he noticed one of the dishwashers a very young blonde girl crying bitterly He questioned her she told him she was Swiss like himself that she had been in America a short time and was very unhappy He comforted her When it became no longer possible to conceal her condition he married her this was a bitter blow to the old waiter who had in those twenty years of deprivation saved one hundred thousand dollars and wanted to make a gentleman out of his son Fate favored him The girl died giving birth to a boy The doctors could not understand the case she was a very strong healthy peasant but Martin in a burst of anguish insisted she had died of homesickness Mr Garrison explained to Floyd the word nostalgia originating with the Swiss which meant their longing for their native soil when absent the pain is intolerable ending often in death Floyd was very sorry for the poor peasant mother Then what happened The old man started in the hotel supply business he rented one of my shanties on the river front The firm is still there I used to see old Steele walking up and down before that sign on the door Martin Steele and Son I could never make friends with young Steele he was sullen wordless and seemed to be out of his element Then they bought the house next door and lived there a solitary life Your mother was sorry for lonely little Martin and had him often in here to play with you When Dolly Winthrop came from Boston to visit us we saw she had her eye on the rich widower And she got him said Floyd Yes unfortunately for him And what happened then father She dominated those poor men with her culture shamed them with her pedigree crushed them with her contempt The old man fell into bad habits drank to excess His mind failed people spoke of an illiterate grandfather in the house but visitors never saw him After that episode in the garret Mrs Steele s patience with the boy gave out She insisted on sending him to a strict military school He d come home in the summertime when she was in Nantucket and prowl about the city during the long evenings In Twelfth Street seemingly deserted he d run up and down stoops pulling bells then the spring rollers would fly up and he d count the genteel poor who were sweltering in New York when he grew too old for such pranks he would spend his evenings in the garret watching his father and grandfather playing a strange game of cards called Tarac and listening to their jargon He learnt the game and the jargon with great rapidity His father who was always afraid of troubling his wife died suddenly at his desk then the old man s mind bolted Mrs Steele in a burst of confidence said one day to Mr Garrison It may be very wicked of me but I pray to God not to let him live long Her prayer was answered unrighteous prayers usually are After that Mrs Steele closed the house and went to live in Boston later she sent Martin to Harvard Floyd wrote him several times but his letters were not answered it was many years before the two boys met again Floyd didn t go to college his father couldn t spare him but he gave him a good classical education under the best professors Mr Garrison wasn t training his son for business he wanted him to be a man of culture They took long walks into the country with Emerson Hawthorne Longfellow for companions Thoreau was revolutionary a disjointed mind The historical novels then in vogue were read and reread also foreign literature Realism Nihilism and all the other isms were looked into and studied as the result of unhealthy European conditions Mr Garrison moulded his son in good clay Sunday was the happiest day in the week for Floyd He would slip out of the little Dutch Reform church around the corner restless when the pastor strung out his sermon fearing he should miss Julie who went to the Cathedral Lately he was fortunate to find her there without her mother Good Friday the Cathedral draped in black The sorrow laden music the odor of incense gave him a sensuous feeling of emotion Julie came down the aisle her prayer book pressed against her heart her eyes seeking things beyond this world It seemed to the impressionable youth a desecration to bring her back He looked at the sad faces and bowed heads It s wonderful after so many centuries this sense of personal loss in the people life would be unbearable without the Easter joy the lilies the Resurrection His words sounded poetical to him as he spoke he was very young Julie smiled she seemed less divine out in the sunlight I don t feel that way but Mother is ill and insists on my going an empty pew doesn t look well Floyd was shocked He had read in the great writers those traditional truisms we repeat mechanically The woman s emotional nature endows her with the gift of Faith she has held aloft the Banner of Religion in the great struggle against skepticism They walked down Fifth Avenue There was an expression he had never seen in Julie s calm face an indefinable something as if she had pulled down a veil over her eyes Before her house she didn t give him her hand as usual She was looking expectantly at the upper windows he followed her gaze She waved her hand smilingly there was a face looking out the light made it transparent like yellow wax In a moment it was gone Who was that My grandfather Why haven t I seen him before He doesn t come downstairs Is he ill No I ve wanted to tell you for some time but Mother said it was nobody s business Floyd was hurt Anything that concerns you is of vital interest to me You know that don t you Julie Yes I know it She braced her shoulders looking him straight in the face she was very proud He liked that most girls held themselves too cheaply My grandfather doesn t come down because he disapproves of the way we live He says we have sold our souls I don t understand you We are Jews You needn t come here again She went quickly up the steps and entered the house without looking back Floyd walked down the street towards his house He was terribly excited socially he had never known any Jews He had seen some dark fellows who were wonders at mathematics and chess boys of their creed were limited in numbers in the colleges kept out of social clubs but somehow they managed to filter through everywhere What did it mean How could the Gonzolas be Jews They were Catholics A young man came towards him of striking appearance with a touch of something about him not American He put out his hand laughingly to Floyd It was Martin You ve done with me You deserve it Why didn t you answer my letters Oh I had no time they kept my nose to the grindstone I walked off with the prizes just to spite Aunt Priscilla Mother is very proud of me she calls me my son now There was the old mocking glitter in his eye he had not changed Don t be angry with me He took Floyd s arm Martin could be very winning when he wanted to You ve grown into a fine handsome fellow with the unmistakable brand of the aristocrat strong with the women eh I don t know As gone as ever on Julie More than ever Then Floyd shot out a question Do you know the history of the Gonzolas Martin s answer came back as quickly Yes they are baptized Jews A red streak flushed Floyd s forehead Tell me about them Martin leaned against the gate revelling in Floyd s agitation The Gonzolas go back to the time when the Church in Spain commenced war on the Jews thousands of them were baptized but they still practiced their religion in secret Romantic isn t it No terrible Many of the Catholic Gonzolas became Bishops Cardinals and high state officials on account of their wealth and culture but others true to their Faith fled to Amsterdam where they founded the great banking house which spread its branches all over Europe Julie s grandfather was a handsome dashing fellow He married in the family they all do but he had an affair with an Austrian actress which lasted for years Their son was brought up in the religion of his mother who became pious with age and as expiation dedicated him to the Church She died before he was ordained and Gonzola naturally opposed easily persuaded the boy against it and sent him to America where he took the family name The bank he founded here was successful he became very rich This bastard was Julie s father But they are Catholics not Jews insisted Floyd That s the joke of it laughed Martin An ironic witticism an impish trick of Fate Pedro came with letters from his father to an old friend Joseph Abravanel an orthodox Jew a fanatic of Spanish origin with infernal pride of race He boasts his ancestors provided money to help Columbus fit out his ship Pedro fell desperately in love with Ruth Abravanel those Spanish Jewesses are handsome but most of them are old maids because they won t marry the Germans whom they look down upon That old man I saw today at the window Is Joseph Abravanel Mrs Gonzola s father But how did you know all this I ve heard it scores of times from Julie The crossing of the races interests me I ve got my own ideas about that I m waiting to see how it comes out It s shocking for people to change their religion Martin laughed a bit too loud Floyd thought What s the difference Who believes in it anyhow do you Floyd evaded a direct answer We practice many things out of respect for our parents and our social position He was undeniably well brought up There s one thing I like about Julie said Martin In spite of everything she remains a true daughter of her race I like in her the sensuousness of the Oriental oh I don t mean sexness that may also be there latent I hope it is I see in her the Shulamite maiden who gets up from her couch at night and goes to seek her lover What do you know about Julie You ve been away so long I ve been a week in New York Floyd was angry injured Perhaps you ve been writing to her all this time Perhaps I have I suppose she was very glad to see you I don t know I was mad to see her I couldn t wait I went straight there There was a look of passion in Martin s face Floyd hated him He turned and entered the gate Martin was at his elbow I m coming in to see your father At dinner Martin kept up a fire of witty criticisms Floyd was silent preoccupied Your house has been shut up for some time Where is your mother In Nantucket She loves the shores where her ancestors landed in sailing vessels Your mother s pride of nationality is quite natural I also feel it You don t parade it My mother makes capital out of it But insisted Mr Garrison you are an American you were born here you know no other home English is your mother tongue Yes but race is stronger than language My people were Swiss peasants I may look and speak like a gentleman but sometimes the lout in me is hard to suppress There was a silence Mr Garrison changed the subject Are you going into your father s business No I d smash it with my mad notions Then he flashed a bright look I ve been daubing in oil it s the only thing that interests me I shall go to Paris to study if I live Mr Garrison was all animation That s very good news You will live you re young strong Who knows America is going into the wholesale slaughter business She needs butchers You mean I think we ll be pushed into the War Floyd was all attention He spoke with a thrill in his voice If it comes we Americans will not be wanting in patriotism Martin didn t seem to feel the insinuation Patriotism bah Who cares We ll have to go if we don t they ll shoot us Mr Garrison was sitting with his head in his hands Floyd arose and went to him He had been failing for some time complained of dizziness Dr McClaren couldn t discover any organic trouble Floyd who watched every change of expression saw him grow pale Father you don t feel well Oh yes but I think I ll go and rest awhile He rose from the chair staggered Martin caught him carried him up and laid him on the bed Floyd bent over his father frantically begging him to speak The stricken man raised his hand in a mute blessing then closed his eyes To Floyd the next few weeks were chaotic time space light darkness lost all meaning Martin never left him during those black days always there in the sleepless horror of the night to read to him to go out and pace the streets with him when the walls became insupportable He would have gone under without Martin The funeral over the will read by Colonel Garland the sole executor the few distant relatives from far and near come and gone Floyd took up again the routine of life Mr Garrison had left everything to his son whom he hoped would marry young and be happy in the old home leaving it to his son after him The Garrisons had always lived well in a modest way befitting their position He was sure Floyd would keep up the family tradition He left money to many philanthropic institutions and to his club where he and his father before him had spent many pleasant hours and where he hoped his boy would sit many years after him Colonel Garland commenting on the will to Martin said A sane righteous testament He was a good man In the months that followed Floyd saw little of Julie She called several times with her mother who was very sweet and amiable I hope when you feel more like seeing people you ll come to us often said Mrs Gonzola Floyd looked at Julie who smiled at him and returned the pressure of his hand Martin was a great deal at the Gonzolas but he didn t mention that to Floyd One Sunday afternoon Mrs Gonzola came into the parlor Martin was sitting very close to Julie reading in rich passionate tones a love poem by Oscar Wilde Julie started up and Martin left but all that day she couldn t meet her mother s clairvoyant eyes I don t like him Julie He s no class He was an unmannerly boy and he s a dangerous man I ve told James to say you re out the next time he calls If you meet him accidentally avoid him Yes Mother said Julie After that she saw him often with the assistance of a sympathetic French teacher whose room was post office and rendezvous for the lovers Martin gave Julie glimpses of life He took her to all kinds of strange places a chop suey restaurant with its unpalatable dishes soft lights and insidious Chinamen a dancing cafe which at that time was not supposed to be a place for young ladies but best of all was Hippolyte Hippolyte s Parlor flaunted on Fifth Avenue It had a magnificent plate glass show window fitted with Circassian walnut in which was one red feather fan on a cushion of Nile green velvet one jeweled comb and a Pierrot costumed in black silk with a large white ruff his face wonderful in its languid perversity Up the side street there was a private door which opened halfway to let in ladies heavily veiled Julie s ambition was to see what was behind that fascinating door today it is no longer a mystery In the Middle Ages Hippolyte would have been a miracle man summoned to a fair Venetian to deepen the red of her hair the rose in her cheeks the marvel of her eyes selling for a purse of gold charms to rob a rival of a coveted lover Times have not changed nor people only appearances Martin took Julie into the shop one day and introduced her to Hippolyte who pronounced her ravissante thereupon Martin bought a costly box of perfume Julie was afraid to take it home I ll settle that laughed Martin and poured it over her then they ran around the reservoir to get rid of the odor Mrs Gonzola noticed it but said nothing Julie was standing at the window waiting for her mother Her gloved hands impatiently agitating the curtains Mother the car is here I shall be late for my music lesson The voice answering from upstairs was nervous trembling It s impossible for me to go with you today I m not well A flash illumined Julie s face but her voice was under perfect control I m sorry From the upper window her mother watched her music roll in hand stepping into the car Mrs Gonzola realized more and more acutely that her lovely child was developing into a beautiful woman there was no feeling of joyful pride Horrible agonizing fear stopped the current of her blood Julie alone in the car drew a long breath The pink of her lips turned red the color slowly overflowing into her cheeks She pulled the cord asked the chauffeur in her soft sensuous voice to stop at the nearest drug store there she telephoned then drove to the house of her professor She was a gifted pianiste she played with a sure velvety touch surmounting with ease all technical difficulties The professor went into ecstasies about the beautiful child woman with Eternal Love in her fingers The car turned into the Park Martin was walking up and down by the little lake He hated to wait She never kept an appointment if she didn t come today he was through His heart leaped when he saw her The girl had a terrible power over him She said smilingly We ll go across town and up Riverside Drive for an hour Then I ll drop you at the club They sped along in the car He pulled down the shades drew off her gloves tearing the buttons in his haste crushed her two hands in his moist hot ones spoke quickly panting with excitement I ve thought it all out I m going to your mother tonight No No gasped Julie Write to her first I have written to her as politely as I knew how I told her I loved you and wanted you to be my wife He read the answer his voice shaking with anger and wounded pride I have no words to reply to your impertinent letter Julie will not marry until she is of age You are not the man I consider worthy of her You take it for granted that she is willing I know her better She will not consent I warn you not to molest her with further attentions and consider the matter closed She crouched in the corner speechless She will blame me She will say I encouraged you You did didn t you Yes but marriage I m too young yet He pressed her to him with a force that left her helpless He would show her haughty mother who was the master With his face pressed against hers he talked expostulated begged threatened to kill himself kissing her again and again until she gave in She would do anything everything he asked of her but he must give her twenty four hours to win over her mother If you fail Then I will go with you You promise Yes Julie Your mother will influence you against me No one can do that You are mine I will not give you up He swore an oath which made her shudder With a quiver of terrible joy she put her arms around his neck Her lips sought his Every afternoon Floyd Garrison occupied a deep chair in the window of his club on upper Fifth Avenue a privilege inherited by the law of precedence from his father and grandfather His great grandfather was one of the founders of the original club house which was downtown an old building with raftered ceilings wooden models of ships and a portrait of Peter with the game leg In time the youngsters of moved uptown refurnished in plush and became very exclusive They kept people out for lack of pedigree or difference of religious conviction A young scion of the new rich said enviously to Floyd I spend much more on my tailor than you do you can afford to wear your old clothes Floyd smiled He took in the young man a fighting figure physically strong eager on the alert with gambler s eyes You ve never had to sweat blood for money The expression was coarse but it threw a mental picture No I ve never sweated blood for a living I didn t say a living I said money Any idiot can make a living A man must have money and lots of it to be anybody it s a hot game He wiped his forehead Floyd wondered if money could buy his armchair in the club window He was sure it couldn t but he was a gentlemanly young fellow he wouldn t hurt the man s feelings Destiny had been more than kind to him He wasn t grateful he took life s favors as a matter of course In fact he never gave it any thought When his father died sorrow blunted the keen edge of existence now after a year he was waking up His heart s desire was Julie Gonzola He had no fear it was the eve of fulfillment Sitting there in the club window idly watching the traffic he saw the Gonzola car Julie was inside with Martin They stopped at the entrance Martin sprang out Floyd waited for him with a pleasant touch of expectancy Now there would be a long talk about Julie He came swinging in his dark face quivering with excitement Floyd didn t take Martin seriously his unpleasant emotional nature gave his actions a touch of exaggeration which repelled Floyd with his calm undisturbed nature Well why all this excitement What s happened now He spoke laughingly Martin was always getting into some transient mix up I may as well tell you you ll have to know it I ve asked Julie to marry me Floyd was on his feet hurt angry Martin had listened hours to what he called love ravings about Julie knowing he was waiting only for his year of mourning to expire It was treachery They faced each other Martin had an air of triumph but he turned away from Floyd s accusing eyes I ve given her twenty four hours to prepare her mother She ll not consent Oh won t she I know the way to make her Then he walked away Julie crouched in the corner of the car her dark pupils contracting dilating she was going home to prepare her mother The contempt in that letter she had written to Martin was awful but she had promised and she braced herself for the fight She was used to battles bitter uncompromising used to the struggle of antagonistic spirits but she had always been kept out of all that agony pampered spoilt worshipped by her mother indulged by her grandfather and now she must fight them both and she would If they stood out against Martin she would keep her word and go away with him this was her determination She stepped out of the car and found her mother waiting for her in the hall she knew what was coming Mrs Gonzola led the way upstairs to her bedroom watched Julie take off her hat and coat and smooth down her hair How long have you been meeting this man without my knowledge You mean Martin Yes Since you forbade him the house This is the first time in your life that you have openly disobeyed me Why did you do it I love him Mother and he loves me and I am going to marry him She had rehearsed it in the car Mrs Gonzola implored her not to marry that ruffian who had intrigued to get her affection No man of honor would have acted like that He was not the man for her she was too young to realize it she would hate him in the end She begged entreated her to wait a year Julie burst into convulsed sobs He won t wait Mother I ve been through all that with him Mother Mother Don t stop it don t I must marry him I must Mrs Gonzola gave a terrible cry What do you mean tell me Why must you marry him Why Because because he says he ll kill me if I don t Then Mrs Gonzola warned her of the anger of Father Cabello who would never marry her to an atheist a heretic warned her of her grandfather s curses and the old Jew could curse she heard him again as he stood over her on the day of her marriage pouring out his anger His curses had come true in her wretched life and this disobedient child she was suffering as he had suffered that day but now the old man was her only hope Julie worshipped him She threatened her with his anger the wrath of the great Jewish God who does not forgive who would bring down punishment upon her and her children s children The girl lay flat on the ground quivering with horror fear then she became quite cold and stiff and fell into a cataleptic trance which lasted an hour Mrs Gonzola undressed her put her into bed and lay beside her holding her close The girl gradually grew warm and smiled at her mother The spasm of obstinacy over she was again the submissive child She would sacrifice herself and Martin it was her duty she became calm almost cheerful as was usual after those spells She wanted her mother to dress her as she did when she was a child Mrs Gonzola was happy her life was bound up in this girl You look so beautiful Julie go and show grandfather Mrs Gonzola stood at the bottom of the stairs till Julie went in where Joseph Abravanel sat reading unconscious of the tragedy which had been enacted below He blessed her called her a good child the hope of his life Then she and her mother dined in the big room with its dark Spanish tapestry and gold plate it was a festive occasion Mrs Gonzola praised Floyd and his devotion to the memory of his father You always liked him best as a child didn t you Julie No Mother I I liked them both Then the fear came again of Martin He will kill me Mother I m afraid of him afraid Julie I have no strength to fight for you Marry Floyd he is a simple honest boy He has always loved you To her mother s great amazement Julie answered in slow deliberate tones That will be the only way to save myself but it must be at once I mustn t have time to think about it or I couldn t do it Floyd went home early that afternoon stopping before the little gate He had taken great pains with his garden The lawn was velvety smooth beds of flowers were banked up against the porch geraniums bloomed in boxes at the windows The polished brass knocker the soft white curtain gave the little house an atmosphere of purity cleanliness Passers stopped to admire it they felt that nice people lived there Floyd shook off a sick feeling anger nauseated him The knocker gave out a musical call The door was opened by a bright little Japanese boy the old servants had gradually left during the lonely year of mourning There was nothing changed in the house the wood fire lit the candles on the table set for two he saw his father at the head of it After dinner the boy brought his slippers and velvet house jacket He stretched himself in a big chair and lit his pipe He loved his pipe that was the Knickerbocker strain in him he smoked it with reverence as the old Dutchmen did in the days when pipes were longer and tobacco better He loved to sit before the wood fire and listen to its hissing crackling singing he thought of his mother s ancestors those sturdy Pioneers in their cabins piling on the logs bolting their iron shutters against the howling wolves outside who devoured the bodies and cracked the bones of men The Puritans are gone but the wolves are still with us they eat the soul and sow wolf seed Then he thought how his father had planned his life for him just as he had laid out his garden It had not occurred to him that his son s life must be different from his own His father s time was far away Today things change with a flash there is no more slow development a fire a storm lightning ruins He was a fool to be so sure of Julie she had been very sympathetic in his year of mourning He took it for love Martin that vulgarian with his family history He never had the slightest suspicion of what was going on between them He d been a blind fool He jumped to his feet the clock struck ten Twenty four hours to prepare her mother Why hadn t she said No at once and put an end to it She couldn t want to marry him it was unthinkable but he never knew quite what she did think When he said A penny for your thoughts she grew very serious My thoughts are only for myself He became impatient Why make the thing so complicated It was simple enough they both wanted her and they d have to fight for her as they did as boys They never knew which of them she liked The telephone rang He took up the receiver It was Mrs Gonzola s voice Is it you Floyd Yes Could you come over for a few moments It s late but I ll come at once He stood before the mirror in the hall It reflected a young man clean shaven straight brows eyes deep blue almost black the mouth set with suppressed pain that was all the image gave out nothing of the unsounded depths The narcotic of ease and inherited aloofness had kept the lion of character sleeping Passing the Dillon house Floyd noticed vaguely a sign For Sale Tom Dillon had inherited a large fortune which his father made in whiskey he had boasted he would drink up the well stocked cellar before he got rid of the house It was illuminated tonight he heard music and loud laughter Tom was on the job In the parlor of the Gonzola mansion the butler pressed a button which lit up the unaccountable glass prisms of the electrified fixture it was a familiar room As a boy its grandeur had awed him when he grew older he thought it old fashioned but he didn t want to see it changed He knew little of the other part of the house excepting the dining room which was in old leather heavy dark He had always spoken with superiority of the charming Spanish atmosphere of the room Tonight it struck him differently What an ignorant fool he was A man who mentally kicks himself for being all kinds of a fool is often awakening to wisdom The floor was parquet smooth and polished There were Oriental rugs and deep armchairs upholstered in Turkish and a broad divan with wonderful silk rugs thrown over it Fur animals lay about with enormous heads and glassy eyes The window hangings were of costly lace He had often looked at that bronze figure in a corner tonight it spoke to him It was the Moses of Michael Angelo a noble head with a rippling flowing beard The walls were covered with family portraits in gilt frames turning old gold with age He had said with authority they are Van Dykes Now he noticed signed names unknown to him probably young foreign artists He stood before a portrait of Pedro Gonzola Julie s grandfather painted in Amsterdam after a ball costume A very handsome young cavalier in black velvet with white lace falling over his long tapering fingers he thought of Martin s coarse hands no the room was not Spanish Mrs Gonzola came in she too took on a new significance a woman of fifty small sinuous with pale eyelids forehead lips the process of Time had almost washed out the human face which had been even at its best but a soft water color Tonight Floyd seemed to see within that white Image Past struggles like smothered flames flashed up again momentarily Her English was perfect so academic it sounded foreign born in New York taught by professors she spoke like one She had tried to bring Julie up that way but changed conditions were too strong for her Floyd I am in a terrible dilemma Martin has asked Julie to marry him Yes I know She tried to draw away her hands but Floyd held them fast Your decision means everything to me Floyd put his arm around her he had known her all his life She clung to him there were tears in her voice but her eyes were dry Julie told you of our ancestry Yes Does it make any difference Why should it An evasive answer Why didn t he make it simple and say No Some people are prejudiced but you have no family ties and are not religious I don t want Julie to marry Martin he s vulgar they are peasants common cattle drivers his grandfather was a waiter I can t think of it it s too horrible Floyd tried to be fair But if Julie likes him better She does not I m sure of it She is very impressionable Martin has a kind of brute force you know him He ll talk her into it It will be a terrible misfortune for her it will ruin her life I must make it impossible I must Floyd was speechless with excitement She had her arms around him clinging to him Julie is a strange girl at the mercy of inherited instincts she will be safe with you Why did she say that What was wrong with Julie Floyd began to take Julie s part against her mother Mrs Gonzola be calm I beg of you You know I have wanted Julie all my life you know I want her now If she loves Martin better what what can I do No no she will tell you herself Mrs Gonzola glided out of the room Floyd wiped his forehead What did it all mean Why was she so afraid of Martin What was he doing there anyhow Martin had been open with him now he was conspiring with her mother No he would do nothing underhand He would give Martin a chance to get his answer as agreed Julie must be free to choose She stood in the doorway He wanted to tell her what was in his mind but she didn t give him time She came straight to him put her arms around his neck her soft body intoxicated him His heart s desire realized Julie his wife he couldn t let her go he kissed her again and again She laughed and said in her soft sensuous voice Oh oh don t eat me It s forever Julie forever He stammered out the words He was terribly excited poor lad She grew very serious Yes it is forever Then she cried and he tried to comfort her I ve had a great deal of excitement today Go now She let him kiss her again He went unsteadily like a soberly inclined man who had rushed violently into an orgy of liquor It was dawn when he slipped quietly out of his house and dropped a letter to Martin into the post box he had written everything just how it happened The only thing that clouds my indescribable happiness is the thought that you may resent my not giving you your chance but it was out of my hands When Mrs Gonzola called me tonight I had no idea of what was awaiting me My happiness came to me I cannot let it go He expected no answer to his letter It came by return mail There is nothing to be angry about I would have done the same in your place I would take her away from you now if it were possible but don t be uneasy she doesn t care enough for me I don t think she s insane about you but you are the safer proposition You won t see me for some time Martin had a way of disappearing when things went against him Floyd read the letter once more The safer proposition Of course she would be safe with him he was too happy to let the significance of a word worry him He slowly tore the letter in little pieces and said nothing to Julie about it The next evening he went over to dine with the Gonzolas Mrs Gonzola had asked him quietly not to come during the day Julie needs time to calm down Calm down laughed Floyd It s too early for that She is quite exhausted She must get used to the idea It was not exhausting to him to get used to happiness It came natural to think of Julie as my dear wife He saw many many years ahead As they grew old they would get fonder of each other like his mother and father A pang shot through him if they were alive now He had not lived like other men he had waited for the one woman The close contact was intoxicating leaving him incapable of logical reasoning He waited impatiently for the evening Julie stood under the big chandelier her soft white gown with a touch of red velvet seemed a part of her flexible body a filet of it was drawn over her forehead Her full red lips were a splash of color in her pale face She came quite naturally to him Floyd s heart beat furiously Mrs Gonzola looked regal in black lace relieved by a huge diamond brooch set in old silver She approved of Floyd he was a gentleman My father lives with us Julie has probably told you I want her to take you up to see him Don t speak of your engagement yet Julie will break it to him gradually but I want him to know you and I am sure he will love you as we do How gracious she was it was like the condescension of a Queen Break it to him as if it were bad news Floyd felt uncomfortable Julie led the way up to the fourth floor They entered a very large room with mullion windows one at the extreme end of yellow glass He was conscious of warmth a glory of golden sunlight the odor of a hothouse many palms Under a tropical tree with enormous leaves spread out like an umbrella sat a man with a black silk skull cap on his head He was absorbed in his book He did not raise his eyes Floyd at a first glance caught the impression of age because of a long thick white beard falling in waves turning up at the edges in curls which reminded him of Michael Angelo s Moses but this statue lived Julie spoke very respectfully She seemed in awe of him Grandfather I ve brought Floyd Garrison to see you He arose and came toward Floyd He wore a long black silk coat reaching to his ankles with velvet collar cuffs and slippers His feet were very small his hands like a woman s the voice which came from that frail body was clear penetrating My name is Joseph Abravanel His eyes were young Floyd felt himself being measured and weighed but that didn t disturb him he had no secrets I know all about you Floyd I ve watched you grow up That little snowball fight with Martin twelve years ago this winter was fine You were small but you buried him He laughed like a boy Floyd sat down beside him listening intensely he didn t want to lose a word Julie flittered about the room watching them I like you Floyd you re a good fighter Oh no laughed Floyd I m a pacifist The old man shook his head Wait you haven t found yourself yet We Jews are fighters although the world says we are not We ve been fighting for thousands of years Then he spoke of the possibilities of America joining the War It will come we will be forced into it We Jews will get the worst of it as usual but that s good for us the will to live becomes stronger He continually repeated we Jews as if to impress the fact of his race upon Floyd The American aliens will find relatives in every European field of battle it will be terrible like the Civil War brother against brother Floyd had never thought of it that way The Jews are like an old tree its branches spread all over the world it roots are in the Bible The Arian education is Greek opposite to that of the Hebrew The Greeks worshipped form beauty its idols were in stone The Hebrews rejected that they based their religion on the Word You see the body the Soul the Image Greek the Soul Hebrew After that Floyd found his way often to the fourth floor He heard many things foreign to his way of thinking but of deep interest to him Now said Floyd laughingly one evening I ve made myself popular with all the family No answered Julie there is one more Father Cabello Father Cabello was an indispensable part of the Gonzola family from the Celtic help in the kitchen to the aristocratic old man on the top floor whose guest he was on Friday evenings when he shared a simple meal of vegetables and fruit washed down with a glass of delicious Palestinian wine after that a game of chess and a long theological discussion which lasted many a time until the small hours The two men of the same origin but of different creeds understood each other perfectly When it came to a burning question such as the sincerity of Paul whether his hatred of the High Priests of Judea had not instigated him to dethrone them by putting another in their place one he had never seen or whether it was an inspiration a voice out of the wilderness then Joseph Abravanel s eyes took on a fiery gleam Father Cabello seeing the danger signal would evade the question by a witty remark ending with a laugh Julie gave Floyd a hint He invited the good Father to lunch with him at the club He sat in the window watching the priest shaking hands with one and the other a man of Church and World known to rich and poor and generally beloved Floyd had a feeling of embarrassment but Father Cabello put him at once in smooth waters by a remark about the exclusive policy of the club Yes answered Floyd This distinction against aliens is very reactionary He forgot he was on the membership committee before he was engaged then he ventured to say I I am very glad you do not oppose my marriage with Julie Why should I He knew Floyd was not a Catholic why did he make him emphasize that I was prepared for your opposition on account of my religion The priest smiled The man who fights the inevitable destroys no one but himself I have had one great battle in that family I don t want a second if it can be avoided When Julie was born her mother and I together fought and conquered Joseph Abravanel a fine fellow deeply learned In the great days of the Church in Spain he would have been a distinguished Cardinal The priest puffed regretfully at his cigar His ancestors were foolishly fanatic they chose the evil of emigration to the glory of power and the Pope Floyd answered eagerly It was a question of principle they should be admired respected for such noble self sacrifice The priest liked the boy there was no complication to fight in him This marriage was a question of you and one other I chose you Floyd s face grew hot It had all been arranged between the mother and the priest Then you considered me the lesser of two evils The priest smiled again You are not an evil you are a concession we make them if they do not bring us future harm the children will be ours but don t let it worry you now Pedro Gonzola s marriage with a Jewess was also a concession Why did you allow that This boy is no fool thought the priest he took pains to answer the question We were mistaken in our calculations we are sometimes we remained passive because we were sure Joseph Abravanel would fight it with all his might and he did But another power mightier than he and the Church together won out the strongest combination in the world youth and love Ruth was his only child she threatened to leave him he worshipped her he had to give in but he went to live with the young couple with a firm resolve to counteract our influence The inevitable happened she came to us for consolation Julie was born in the church They were silent The priest lived again that interesting conflict The old man had fought well he was wonderful with his unanswerable arguments but reason went down under the great emotional rising of the soul the need of forgiveness Floyd s voice brought him back Why did he remain in his daughter s house Because with the obstinate patience of his race he had hopes of Julie s children Then he bent nearer lowering his voice There is something else you should know From the day Julie was baptized Joseph Abravanel has never seen or spoken to his daughter The atmosphere of tragedy folded itself about Floyd he felt the clashing of spiritual powers within the walls of that outwardly peaceful home now creeping like slow fire into his life Near Floyd s house there was a small stone chapel ornamented with dark wooden beams it had been built by Mr Garrison and Mr Steele They brought over their pastor from Scotland a rugged sincere man Floyd still grew chilly when he thought of the bare whitewashed walls the stone floor the hard wooden benches No choir no organ no stained glass windows The pastor generally took his text from one of those Hebrew calamity howlers and hurled curses at the heads of his unfortunate parishioners He was a man of mild disposition but he thought it was his duty to snatch them from the worship of Mammon The Idolaters would listen meekly rise sing a hymn and file out penitently to pursue on week days their ungodly practices In course of time the pastor went to heaven his congregation the other way Martin said it might be the reverse Other pastors modified their curses or ceased to hurl them the times demanded blessings and paid for them The congregation grew rich and moved uptown Floyd kept his pew out of respect for his parents He told the pastor a sensible man from the West with a large growing family of his coming marriage We are not losing you we lost you when your father died Of course you must consider the bride s family the women generally arrange those matters but I would like to come and see you sometimes Your children may in course of time think differently He also had hopes of the next generation Now Floyd pushed away all unpleasant thoughts his youth demanded happiness He went up the steps of the Gonzola mansion with a light heart humming to himself The butler ushered him into the dimly lighted parlor He waited but Julie did not come He heard voices above He was one of the family now by right of knowing all its secrets He found Julie crouched at the bottom of the upper stairs at the door of the old man s room was Mrs Gonzola on her knees Floyd tried to question Julie but she silenced him with an imperative gesture The voices of Father Cabello and Joseph Abravanel penetrating the closed door rang throughout the house Floyd heard his name it was a question of his marriage with Julie of the ceremony and again those future generations He heard the deep tones of the priest threatening persuasive the other voice trembling feeble rising in a despairing shriek dying away in sobs It was terrible every word seemed to strike that prostrate figure at the door like a whip Floyd thought of the rack The priest came out wiping his forehead he lifted the stricken woman the Church had won again They were married quietly at home the bride in old lace and priceless family jewels a vision of Oriental beauty Martin s words came back to Floyd To me she is not a modern girl she is the Shulamite maiden who rises from her couch at night and goes out to seek her lover Floyd wanted to bring his wife to the house where he was born Julie gladly consented He had been so dear giving in to everybody for the sake of peace At the door of his home Floyd took Julie up in his arms and carried her over the threshold as his fathers had done before him The young couple were called home from a brief trip by the sudden death of Joseph Abravanel Julie s grief was terrible She stood by the plain deal coffin where he lay in his shroud looking long at the marble face Floyd felt her suffering but he was powerless to console her He wondered why Mrs Gonzola kept her room she surely would want to say good bye to her father He turned she was there she entered slowly as if in fear Julie made a quick step forward The voice that came from Mrs Gonzola s white lips was red with the blood of her race I must see him You dare not Have pity on me I promised him to keep you away He will not know He will know he must rest in peace They were not mother and daughter they were enemies Mrs Gonzola turned and went downstairs in silence She died a few days later without breaking that silence Joseph Abravanel had given away what little he possessed during his lifetime to Julie he left a small Hebrew prayer book worn with age Mrs Gonzola s will was complicated She had given generously to the Church for years Julie was to have the house and contents and the income of what was left the capital going to the grandchildren on condition of their fidelity to the Church otherwise it went to support a theological seminary in Rome They were standing together in the parlor The room was icy her face pinched worn I am going to sell the house and everything in it What Sell your family portraits I ve had enough of them persecuting me with their angry faces They despise me I feel it I have felt it all my life as a child I saw them in my dreams coming out of their frames threatening me I am done with them done with them She broke into convulsive sobs She took him by the hand and led him around the room stopping before each one of her childhood s inquisitors Do you want to live with them all your life No I certainly do not but I ll have them packed up and sent back to the family in Europe who will hang them in their picture galleries We have none The sight of Julie in lustreless black and a long cr pe veil made Floyd shudder it was awful Black obscured her beauty she spoke in low tones went around on tip toe There was the silence of death in his house I can t stand this Julie We re living as in a cemetery it s getting on my nerves How long is it going to last One year Floyd didn t like to appear heartless but he had already learnt to use a little diplomacy with his wife Do you realize how unbecoming black is to you She looked at him startled It is my duty to wear it It s gone out of fashion Only old people wear cr pe nowadays a black band is quite sufficient Why should you parade your grief She didn t answer but the next morning she came to breakfast in a royal purple tea gown Floyd kissed her eyes lips hands he had his sweetheart again Julie smiled at him She liked to be worshipped Come come I m hungry Don t you want any breakfast I want nothing but you The Japanese laid the morning paper on the table and discreetly withdrew Floyd looking over the headings sprang to his feet War Julie gave a startled cry You won t go you won t leave me alone I must do my duty He went down to see Colonel Garland The office was in a whirl of excitement The Colonel was prancing like an old war horse Everybody was talking at once It had to come the President had put it off too long some were for some against it but the fact was there the United States had thrown her hat into the ring Floyd s face was flushed his eyes shining I m going to volunteer The Colonel looked grave Wait let the single men go first Floyd couldn t be held back every man he knew had volunteered He met Tom Dillon with a little flag stuck in his buttonhole his hat set jauntily on the side of his head I m going into camp tomorrow That night there was a scene with Julie she begged cried fainted Dr McClaren was sent for the diagnosis was Motherhood Floyd did not volunteer All New York crowded the streets to bid Godspeed to the first regiment sailing for France Our Boys with flowers in their caps flowers stuck in their guns marched proudly The people went mad Floyd holding Julie tightly stood on the corner of Fifth Avenue He had a feeling of depression for the first time in his life a wish had been thwarted He looked down at the curly head with its sport hat pressed close to his arm noticed the glances of admiration She was worth the sacrifice Suddenly with a well directed aim she flung a rose at a passing soldier He caught it pressed it to his lips with a long glance backward That was Martin said Julie They walked home in silence Julie had a headache from the noise and excitement and went to bed early Floyd sat up he tried to think of Julie and the future He couldn t the cheers were still in his ears the tramping of feet the clashing of cymbals He sat there out of it Love was cruel The boy was christened by Father Cabello his last service to the Gonzola family He had been called to Rome where honors awaited him for his services to the Church in America What name are you going to give him asked the Father Julie lying in her white bed answered His name will be Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison Floyd thought it too high sounding for modern times an American citizen couldn t carry it but Julie had her way After Father Cabello s departure she went seldom to the Cathedral and gradually ceased altogether I ve lived all my life under the tyranny of two religions My boy must be free of that when he is old enough he will choose for himself But she still read her grandfather s little Hebrew book at night when she couldn t sleep or when she awoke terrified from the reality of her dreams She never spoke of it to Floyd and he didn t like to intrude BOOK II The Present gray tones of actuality A moving picture Crowds struggling Shattered Ideals Truth in danger BOOK II Martin Steele came back to America after two years absence He was known over there as the Yankee Devil Danger seemed to attract him he rushed through a rain of bullets and planted the flag in the face of the enemy He was happy the straining of nerve and sinew helped to quiet an inward restlessness On landing he found a telegram from his mother she wanted him to go up and see The Museum before coming to Boston He tore up the telegram with an ugly scowl The corner of Broadway and Forty second Street gigantic waves of humanity passing moving up down across screeching automobiles emitting pestilential odors rapidly changing electric signs the only stagnation was in the air it weighed on his chest halted his breath He stood with his hands deep in his pockets There was something psychic going on within him the boys who came home brought with them a strange consciousness they had seen miracles He felt the leaden mentality oozing out from the crowd became keenly conscious of the mixture of races those tense strained faces looking straight ahead the past forgotten the future who cares We build for today the next man will build for his day The Present in electric letters of colored flames How am I to borrow or steal for women for wine Prohibition ha ha who takes that seriously who takes anything seriously Martin elbowed himself through the crowd a soldier in khaki people looked after him a fine strong fellow from the prairies seeing the sight of the Great White Way He mopped his forehead saying to himself Where shall I go He stood before the house where he was born read the black and gold sign on the door The Winthrop Museum Tuesday Thursday Saturday admission free other days fifty cents It was Friday The sleepy official handed him a card Martin threw down his fifty cents and entered There were a few stragglers strolling from case to case mostly strangers A large omnibus Seeing New York waited outside the man on the box blew the horn This is the house of the celebrated Winthrop family whose ancestors came over in the Mayflower The owners have generously donated their historical relics to the city ten minutes allowed for inspection He looked at the old furniture falling to pieces from want of repair some were really family relics but the parading of them who cares for other people s old sticks The caretaker was putting on his hat to go when Martin spoke to him I m Mr Steele I m going to close up this dugout He put ten dollars in the man s hand With one strong wrench he tore down the sign locked the door and put the key in his pocket He stopped before the Garrison home it was lit up inside He opened the gate shut it with a sharp click and went up toward Fifth Avenue The row of small brick houses were in a sorry plight On Maud Ailsworth s window there was a sign Table Board on the Gonzola mansion For Sale The mother and grandfather dead Julie married Then he bought the biggest basket of red roses he could find and followed on the heels of the messenger Floyd was in the nursery revelling in the beauty of mother and child a wonderful Murillo picture Julie laughed at his caressing epithets Two angels to take care of etc etc and all the rest a man like Floyd would naturally say to the young mother of his child She went to dinner leaning on his arm Julie was one of the rare women who become beautiful with motherhood from the first moment of its consciousness she was a changed being The grief and horror of her double misfortune vanished her eyes became larger more brilliant The dead white of her skin changed into a soft pink the rippling hair shone getting more and more rebellious escaping in soft curls about her face She gave a cry of pleasure at the roses on the table Oh how gorgeous Floyd you mustn t spoil me like this I didn t send them You didn t No my word of honor Then who I can t think of anyone unless Who She fastened a rose in her dress forgetting to answer The table was faultlessly set with fine damask The heavy cut glass sparkled in the candle light A pine wood fire threw a soft glimmer over the room there was no other light Floyd felt a sense of sthetic satisfaction He hated the big flats of the West Side with their electric illumination he was glad he didn t have to live in them The bell rang Who can that be at this hour You needn t announce me I ll go right in Martin Julie was on her feet looking for a way of escape Floyd put her back in her seat Stay where you are Floyd s hand went out to meet Martin s he d come back from the front and they had known each other all their lives I landed today I feel like a stranger in a foreign land Will you let me have a bite with you He hadn t changed heavily tanned a little more muscular a little louder He grasped Julie s hand and held it fast There was a slight heaving under the red rose her cheeks had lost their color He absorbed everything with those eyes of his She felt the loose gown hanging from her shoulders and drew it around her full bosom He turned to Floyd with a laughing question in his eyes Floyd laughed back he couldn t help feeling a sense of triumph Martin was very entertaining told amusing stories in French there was something pathetic in his efforts to please Julie took a childish delight in his medals Floyd s face clouded over Martin took them from her hand They mean nothing to me You should be proud of them insisted Julie They are a reward for bravery You were brave We read about you I wouldn t give the others the satisfaction of thinking me a coward But you were afraid at first it s only natural He turned and looked straight at her No What is there in life for me It takes more courage to go on living There was a long pause Julie arose said good night Floyd went with her to the stairs kissed her Martin s eyes followed them Then Floyd threw himself into the big chair by the fire forgetting everything but the dear woman the dear child Martin sat puffing at his pipe it was foul Julie couldn t bear a pipe Floyd had given up his then he shut the door carefully lit his pipe laughingly saying something about a bad example He was eager for more stories of war carnage murder A wonderful experience I envy you Why didn t you go I couldn t leave Julie in her condition There was a silence then Martin spoke in a hard voice which conveyed repression Your experience has been more wonderful than mine He threw down his pipe pacing the room muttering broken sentences there was a strange glitter in his eyes He cursed everything everybody Patriotism bah We punched holes in that lie sitting in our dugout waiting for the death call Love of the soil bah I was born next door another year you also will be driven out Our children won t even know the spot where their parents lived what does it matter anyhow The farmer bah He values the soil as he does his cow for what he can get out of it it isn t his land He came over bought it because he couldn t steal it mortgaged it misused it The boys won t go back to the farm They want money they ll get it the next few years The rest of the world will starve America will wallow in the filthy stuff not you nor I we re pikers that s what we are our fathers thought they left us rich I could plunge in reconstruct sell out gamble with my money and make a fortune What then He stood glaring at Floyd a desperate hopeless creature Martin s ravings always depressed him Julie s voice broke the oppressive silence Floyd bring Martin up to see the baby He stood in the doorway like a bashful boy Floyd put the child in his arms he looked down at the little dark head against his arm bent and kissed it giving Julie a look of lightning rapidity It scorched her Martin became a frequent visitor at the Garrisons running in often at inopportune moments Julie was sitting over the fire in the dining room the child asleep in a little pink lined basket beside her She leaned back there was a feeling of lassitude weariness she had every reason to be happy no woman could ask more but why that longing to get away from her child her husband from herself Why did she feel the walls of her life She knew there was something wrong with her she felt too intensely Martin Why had he come back She was happy with Floyd he was good gentle kind so different but Martin Martin She heard his voice outside she must get upstairs she went swiftly to the door too late he was in the room taking her in with those terrible eyes Why did you break in like this It s very inconsiderate I am not fit to see strangers Strangers Julie She raised her arms above her head twisting the thick ropes of falling hair trying to fasten them Her shawl fell away disclosing the corsetless form the open neck Waves of passion rushed through him Don t go Give me one moment more just one He caught at her shawl A terrible shame burnt her She staggered out slamming the door after her Martin pressed the shawl warm from her body to his face the hot tears rolled down He didn t come again for some time One day Floyd met him at the club Why don t we see you at the house We miss you Martin s eyes had a look of abstraction Your home is like a nest just now There is room in it only for two and the little bird It was a beautiful thought but that humor never lasted long with him He said abruptly I ve sold my house They are going to build a skyscraper It will take away your light Floyd s face darkened That won t drive us out Why stay there You can get a big profit I was born there I want to die there Martin laughed mockingly A man who dies in the house where he was born should be ticketed and put into a museum The wreckers were at work tearing down the Steele house Floyd passing found Martin in overalls his hair face eyelashes white with plaster dust his tongue swinging with the hammer You obstinate devil I ll show you who is the master The wall was well built too well in the old days they built for the future He gave it a blow another another it didn t yield He worked himself into a purple rage Blow after blow fell upon the unhappy partition it trembled the others jumped away it fell Martin stood triumphantly among the ruins Floyd s eyes grew moist Was there no feeling in the man Did he realize he had made himself homeless Now he must join the rich tramps the poor tramps that army of wanderers living here awhile there awhile places to sleep and eat luxurious tawdry squalid imitations according to their money value New York was becoming a homeless city He related the incident to Julie Martin looks seedy he neglects his appearance he s a forsaken wretch Julie had a sudden inspiration I m going to get him married Floyd laughed It takes two for that Julie stood before her mirror a pleasing picture flashed back A smooth young face not a trace of the physical agony she had been through of the mental agony her life was running now along smooth conventional lines a beautiful woman bending forward studying her expression Is there a tell tale line No the mask fits to the life May I come in It was Maud Ailsworth invited to dinner to meet Martin Julie was going to see what she could do Maud s mother had been dead four years she had known her only as an invalid propped up by pillows with an ice bag on her head Maud left school early to take the housekeeping which was a sorry job in her hands Mrs Ailsworth s philosophy of living was that good things were cheapest in the end The modest capital left by her husband melted they sold the house and lived on the money When Mrs Ailsworth died Maud had five thousand dollars She took a room on the top floor rear of a fashionable hotel and spent her time looking for a husband She wanted a nice man she would wait another year and then there was always Tom Dillon She didn t have to act with him He knew she was a beggar she knew he was a rotter but she wouldn t do it until her last penny was gone She still had hopes of someone better She was pretty quick with an answer and much liked by men but they didn t marry her Why She asked herself that question many a night after a party where the men went the limit There she stopped the other girls jumped the boundaries She wondered if that was why she was single at twenty five Well she couldn t it wasn t her virtue it was her misfortune She noticed at a first glance how much prettier Julie had become but she didn t compliment her It wasn t her way You have had a hard time haven t you Yes but it s worth all I suffered Maud s nostrils expanded taking in the subtle essence of violet powder Oh I smell the baby She flew to the crib and took the child in her arms You handle it like a grandmother cried Julie Why don t you get married Maud laughed mirthlessly Why Because the only man I really want won t ask me it s your fault Julie one wasn t enough for you How can you say that What are you going to do with the other insisted Maud Julie answered with a touch of seriousness I am going to get him for you if I can Do you like him Maud spoke slowly weighing her words Liking is too neutral for Martin Steele it is either love or hate I think I hate him She gave a quick glance into the mirror as they went down to dinner The men were waiting in the parlor Martin was ill at ease he felt like a waiter in evening dress Floyd wore it differently he melted into it Maud as the guest of honor was charming All laughed heartily at her frank admissions and keen enjoyment of the fruits so long forbidden We ve got a free hand Politically economically the right to work You can have it interrupted Martin I ll give you my share But we want more Moral Equality Isn t that a step backward said Floyd Until now women were supposed to be morally superior to men Why should they be Equal rights is all we want We are no longer going to be cast out for acting naturally Martin took up the gauntlet You mean you want to have children without being married Maud s eyes shot defiance Yes that s what I mean Haven t you taken that privilege I Not yet but I don t know what I may do It was getting too personal Julie arose from the table Floyd lingered with Martin She doesn t mean a word of all that She s a fine woman she ll make a good wife and mother Martin blew rings of smoke into the air I m quite sure she will but I m not interested Maud was curled up in an armchair by the fire one leg under her the other hanging down she was smoking a cigarette in a gold mounted amber holder Julie put her arm in Floyd s Let s go and say good night to baby Martin smiled at her transparent subterfuge He looked down at Maud a well shaped head correct features eyes curious the black stuff she used gave them the requisite look of the demi mondaine The glass beads around her neck were cheap what there was of the gown was evidently designed and put together by herself Her thin silk stockings were going in the seams he was sure there were holes in the feet He d like to dress her well Yes she was a nice girl he could easily be single with her for six months but marriage Julie s laugh rang out upstairs Maud was conscious of being checked up Well what s the verdict Will you let me say what I think Yes if you let me do the same You will say more than you believe I less There was something fascinating in the fellow s insolence Legs neck shoulders bust perfect the symmetry of thighs and limbs classic but you leave me cold Why She bent over with a touch of eagerness Because there is nothing of mystery about you Ha ha why should a woman be a mystery Then came a flash which revealed depths unsounded Because all holy things are mysterious when a woman ceases to be holy to man she kills love in him Maud wouldn t argue on those lines Other men don t think so They do Have you ever been inside the Museum of Art in Central Park Oh yes I ve been to the receptions Will you come with me to see the pictures and statues I ll go anywhere with you He sat on the arm of her chair You will find in some of the mutilated Grecian goddesses the same length of limbs and lines of body but they are modestly undraped Stop I don t like that expression I believe in leaving something to the imagination A man s imagination in that respect is a vile thing I never thought of it that way Think of it that way will you Yes It slipped out she was sorry at once but she didn t recall it When I look at the girl of today I feel that I am passing with the rest of the crowd before those wonderful marble statues which belong to everyone to no one She was on her feet now blazing at him How dare you demand purity in us Set the example we ll follow suit We give what we receive no more no less She made a rush for the door He caught her two arms You women You women You prate equality you d hate like the devil to have it You know you ve got the best of us Martin s voice rang out it was always too loud when he was excited The woman of today is gambling with every chance against her if she wins she loses she ll get everything she wants even sexual equality and when she has it she ll lose the glory of Life for the human race Look at me I m the average man no better no worse and the most miserable lonely wretch that ever walked in a city overcrowded with beautiful women I would marry any one of them high low rich poor if she would give me the love I m craving for Tell me the truth now can you love anybody but yourself She tried to extricate herself from his iron grasp his accusing eyes Don t don t You hurt me He released her with a bitter laugh When Julie came in Maud was hysterical Martin must have been saying something awful The Japanese announced Miss Ailsworth s car Oh Have you a car exclaimed Julie It belongs to Tom Dillon he wants me to keep his chauffeur busy She was herself again saucy reckless unthinking Martin bent over her speaking in low tones I ll go home with you we ll make up on the way She knew what he meant she d show him he couldn t love her for the moment I don t want you a man s escort is not a guarantee of safety She kissed Julie and swept out followed by Floyd He stood at the door of the car there was something wrong with Maud He thought he saw tears in her eyes He jumped into the car and went home with her Julie was at the window as they drove off Oh Floyd s gone with her He s so old fashioned he hates to see women roaming about alone at night he won t be long She pulled down the blinds put out the lights leaving only the candles and the glow of the fire Martin stood watching her She began to feel uncomfortable Why didn t he say something She was afraid of his silence Maud s a nice girl and very popular I wonder why she doesn t marry He answered roughly I m not going to marry her drop that idea will you He came close to her leaning against the side board You re disappointed I Oh no Confess He put his hand under her chin and forced her to look at him You want to get rid of me Yes I do Why Tell me In the half light her face was like ivory Her eyes shone back into his He started and put his hand on her shoulder what was it he saw there She came closer to him closer he dared not move She kissed him again again murmuring soft love words Then he broke out held her as if he would never let her go calling her his beautiful Queen his Oriental Pearl his Song of Songs She clung to him her body responding to his how long a moment which goes back centuries a century which is only a moment He felt her tears on his face as she caressed and kissed him every drop of blood in him answered I wanted you always You know it you know it I thought the longing would wear away with time my mother said it would I believed her but she lied to me lied It was always there getting more and more unbearable Martin closed her lips with a long kiss This wonderful tempting seductive creature he would never let her go I wanted you to marry Maud to save myself When I saw you with her tonight the pain was unbearable I couldn t go on I couldn t Then she drew away from him and went over to the fire her hands clasped together her face convulsed the red light enveloped her He came to her She put out her hand to keep him back Now it s over Over How little she knew him This is the end No it is only the beginning You were mine I never forgot never They stole you from me nothing can part us now Nothing She was in his arms again It had to come or I should have lost my reason it s over now Go before he comes back She slipped away from him He went out She groped toward the door where was it She was blind then she fell Martin entered his hotel it was past twelve The night orgy had commenced He passed through the room thronged with dancers his coat buttoned up to his neck his soft hat drawn over his eyes stood a moment looking on a strange silent figure out of place in that decorative humanity He sat by the open window in his room the noise from below was deadened by space into a soft humming sound Waves of icy air enveloped him He was unconscious of cold or heat In the flash of a moment life had taken on a different aspect his entire being was one great pulsation Floyd the difficulties before him the dishonor of it came faintly from a distant perspective but he thrust it fiercely behind him The woman filled the world for him he lived over and over that moment of tearing joy her face transfigured with passion her lips her tears the pressure of her body against his a statue come to life for him alone He had been tricked out of his happiness by her mother but now all the powers of Hell couldn t keep him away from her A restless night fixed his resolve He knew exactly what he was going to do He dressed more slowly than usual moving about in a kind of hushed manner he was no longer alone she was there clinging to him He jumped into a taxi and drove down to Twelfth Street The shades were lowered in the Garrison house Next door the wreckers had been clearing away the debris there was now a large open space where his home had been The Italian foreman came up to him speaking in his pleasant broken English A good job eh Everything gone clean as a whistle Tomorrow we commence to build Martin opened the gate of the Garrison house as he stood at the door his hand on the knocker he had a feeling of being mentally unstrung Criminologists say when thieves go to commit a crime they are sustained by a strong sense of fatality a fixed idea that it must be they are drawn into the vortex of crime by an irresistible fascination the lure of adventure the justification of the equality of human rights the spoils the gambler s risk Martin felt vaguely all this a sense of excitement stimulated him like strong liquor He caught his breath as he entered the room he had left the night before She was coming to him again now he would be the first to take her in his arms to hold her until she would consent to go with him he would have to coax perhaps to threaten He set his teeth he had decided it must be or he would kill himself and her The door opened he turned with a smile Floyd stood there very pale Julie is not well When I came back last night I found her lying unconscious on the ground Did she complain to you No The doctor says it s a serious nervous collapse They have shut me out of the room Can I do anything No Keep me posted will you Yes He had counted with everything but that He waited eating himself up with suppressed fury grew thin unbearable in his impatience he would have her nothing could prevent it but death The telephone rang in Dr McClaren s office The doctor was breakfasting but he didn t enjoy as usual his porridge with cream and heavy black bread made by his Scotch housekeeper his mind was elsewhere He had been up a greater part of the night with young Mrs Garrison who went off from one fainting spell into another she complained of intense pains in her head He left her sleeping under bromides she worried him Dr McClaren had lived forty years in New York a gigantic man with bushy iron gray hair and eyebrows a noble head keen kind eyes His friends had advised him to take out his papers he did and paid his taxes honestly but never voted He couldn t understand the political rings he let them fight it out without help from him Born in Edinburgh he studied medicine at its excellent severe university went to London to practice starved there five years then turned his back on an ungrateful country that refused an able doctor a living Coming over to America he made friends with some natives and liked them nice simple fellows they open their hearts to you like a grab bag at a fair everything in it is yours Medicine is a paying profession among Americans they go about with boxes of pills in every pocket Doctor my wife s just been through an operation She s nervous give her something to quiet her will you The doctor objected to sedatives when not absolutely necessary but he found the frail American woman had her own chest of quieting drugs She talked of her operation in professional terms like a doctor He wondered if she knew she could have no children He wouldn t tell her it would break her heart poor thing He soon found out she did know and didn t break her heart about it With the help of his new friends who went to unbelievable trouble and sacrifice of valuable time to show him the ropes he was established in the spacious home in Thirty fourth Street which he eventually bought it was the only permanent thing in his life His simple Americans became complicated millionaires The sands of humanity shifted from decade to decade A great city in the making left him many a time bare of patients but the winds of immigration blew them in again The tidal wave of Europe s overflow became a national industry a weird wonderful gigantic machine they put in a crazy combination of human beings and it vomited Americans The assistant put his head in the door Mr Garrison seems agitated He would like you to come at once The doctor threw down his napkin and jumped into his car the Garrisons were one of the few old families left He was very fond of young Garrison he had brought him into the world nothing like that baby had even been seen before there was a controversy about the name Mr Garrison wanted James according to tradition when it had ceased to be Jan but she wouldn t hear of anything so vulgar she named the child Floyd after the hero of Mrs Holmes last novel But said the doctor suppose he should develop into a strong individuality that name would be too weak for him He won t said Prudence He ll be like all the men of the family a perfect gentleman If Floyd s father had lived he would never have consented to the marriage Julie was a hysterical girl with a tendency to epilepsy that was a secret in a family of many secrets she grew out of it but there were always over developed emotional symptoms He was called in one night She had been taken ill at the opera the music affected her she was quite stiff he brought her to with difficulty He had a shock when he heard of Floyd s marriage He thought there was something going on between Julie and Martin Steele The young couple seemed to be very happy she was a passionate mother such mothers don t make good wives He stood looking down thoughtfully at the sick woman tossing from one side of the bed to the other He had assured Floyd it was only a nervous attack The excavating going on in the neighborhood accounted for the chills alternating with fever She was delirious for hours and after exhausted lifeless Floyd wanted to consult another doctor No no not necessary yet it would frighten the patient but I ll send for Miss Mary Floyd was bewildered Julie was in perfect health and high spirits when he left and drove with Maud to her hotel Scarcely an hour had intervened he found her unconscious What did it mean Julie was not talkative about herself although she drew every thought out of him Was there anything worrying her Could any woman have it better He was her constant companion anticipated her every wish what more could he do He sat brooding the breakfast before him untouched his paper unopened Someone was fumbling at the knocker outside he went to the door he had a vague impression of a very small person a clear voice spoke it was like a bell ringing in his ears Mr Garrison s house Yes what can I do for you Nothing I m going to try to do something for you She flew up the stairs He was a bit startled as if a bird had suddenly fluttered past him He followed her she had already thrown off her cape under which was a white linen dress She took an apron and cap from her bag quickly put them on without a mirror they sat at just the proper angles she was used to dressing in the dark Julie was lying across the bed the covering was in knots the pillows all cavities The girl bent over her murmuring low sounds like a dove cooing Floyd tried to distinguish the words You re very uncomfortable Yes I know how your head aches Oh what pretty hair It s heavy isn t it Let me roll it up for you How warm you are No wonder She flew to the windows let them down top and bottom putting a screen at the bed to shield the patient from the draught She spoke in a low but extraordinarily clear voice every syllable sharply cut A bowl of cracked ice please now the linen Don t bother I ll find everything She was already in the next room exploring When Floyd came up with ice she was changing the sheets it was the most remarkable feat he had ever seen she rolled one off and slipped on the other without disturbing the patient Her hands were tiny but flexible strong it was magic How the room changed everything in order the bed fresh and clean the patient soothed She held Julie s hand whispering all kinds of encouraging things Now I m going to give you something to eat you re hungry of course you are that husband of yours starves you She threw a smiling look at Floyd who smiled back at her She knew he spoilt his wife he could see that No I won t go away I ll stay right here She took a bottle of prepared food out of her bag which she warmed on the electric heater cooing all the time going about noiselessly on the smallest feet Floyd had ever seen A trained nurse from his experience was a loud fat middle aged woman who upset the house ate all day long and had to be waited on by the family This little fairy was so helpful so executive she knew it all she hadn t asked a question When Dr McClaren came that day he gave a quick glance around and said Now everything will be all right Floyd followed him down stairs After a short silence the doctor spoke Has your wife any worries He tried to be quite truthful Oh no at least none that I know of Then he spoke about that little girl upstairs remarking how wonderfully quick she was The doctor smiled Isn t she very young She s had twenty three years of hard experience She was born in a hospital Her mother died at her birth The lot of us took care of her the scrub woman the nurses the doctors the patients she grew up inhaling iodoform it s healthier than eau de cologne Her dolls were little orphan babies She learnt to sterilize instruments at an age when most children are being perambulated in the park She toddled after me sat on the cots watched the patients get well watched them die I could have made a good doctor out of her but she thought nursing was more helpful Her school graduates human beings The patient improved Miss Mary watched her drop into a quiet sleep then flew over to see the doctor She perched on the arm of a big chair it wouldn t do to sit in it when one is tired it was too comfortable What are you doing here Anything wrong No It s that poor man The doctor chuckled Floyd Garrison spoilt child of Fortune husband of the prettiest woman of New York s pretty women belonging to an exclusive set the happy father of a fine boy and here comes this child of the gutter and calls him a poor man Ha Ha The house is going to ruin the food spoilt the butler steals his neckties stockings handkerchiefs the cook falsifies the bills Well how can we cure that By reforming the household would it appear obtrusive I don t know but he s a nice fellow and you might try Thanks that s what I came for I want to make you my partner in crime Wretch He flung a writing pad at her which she dodged with great dexterity and flew out That night the dinner was uneatable Floyd looked helpless Things are going badly since my wife s illness Here was Mary s chance Will you let me attend to that Floyd thanked her hoped she wouldn t bother too much put his car at her disposal then followed her softly up the stairs feeling that he had managed the house very well Julie was asleep Do you think I could go to the club for a couple of hours that is if I m not wanted Oh yes go it will do you good Take the latch key and come in as quietly as possible The next morning Floyd enjoyed a good breakfast waited on by a very pretty girl in black with a dainty cap and apron He had never liked a waitress too much like a tearoom but Ellen the new maid didn t give him a chance to miss the butler she hovered around watching Miss Mary responding to her quick glances This amused Floyd Martin must come to dinner he d fire off witticisms about being under petticoat government Ellen was a girl mother her sweetheart promised to marry her but he didn t Miss Mary saw her through her trouble took her baby to Bridget the wife of a coal heaver who had seven babies Mary encouraged Bridget to go on having them but the cost of living was too high even for a coal heaver She took the poor bastard to her wonderful bosom and nursed it happy because she didn t have to dry up her milk Mary put Bridget in the kitchen Ellen in the dining room the little brat was smuggled in and was so quiet Mary was sure he knew he wasn t wanted She put a neighbor who was also under obligations in charge of the seven babies Floyd was allowed to go in every morning and sit with his wife he noticed Mary remained in the room He said the same thing mechanically every time You feel better this morning don t you The atmosphere of the sick room struck him dumb that ghostly silent creature lying there wasn t Julie He sat at the breakfast table well cooked well served There was a flutter on the stairs Mary flew in and sat opposite him giving him a quick glance Miss Mary we should have a night nurse Oh no there is no necessity of another nuisance in the house But you get no sleep Oh yes I do I hear you moving about at night Oh do you I m sorry I ll get a pair of soft slippers He went up as usual to see Julie Mary met him at the door She said in a low tone Just a minute and don t stay You feel better this morning don t you Her eyes were very wide open she was looking beyond him he turned there was nobody in the room Miss Mary was at the telephone calling the doctor The sick woman raised herself in the bed holding out her arms like a child who wants to be taken up He bent to lift her she pushed him away with unbelievable force I don t want you I want Martin Miss Mary came flying into the room What is it said Floyd She s delirious again The cry never ceased over and over again supplicating in a pitiable voice I want Martin When the doctor came she caught at him eagerly What do you want dear lady tell me I want Martin Floyd s anguish was terrible he was leaning against the door on the verge of a collapse Mary signaled the doctor who took him by the arm and led him into the next room Is it Martin Steele said the doctor Yes Send for him I will not She doesn t know what she s saying Floyd s voice was harsh He was on his feet in a frenzy of rage The voice came again louder more despairing I want Martin Do something for God s sake cried Floyd There is nothing to be done but wait The doctor went back into the room The cry continued Miss Mary came in What is it is she worse No but the doctor says telephone Floyd took up the receiver What could Martin do in that room No no Martin Martin It came again that cry it was terrible Mary put the receiver in his hand He called up the hotel The answer came Out He tried the club Yes Mr Steele was there Who is it Floyd Julie came like a shot through the phone She is about the same Floyd heard the quick gasp of relief wonderful how a wire can bear witness She has intermittent attacks of fever calls for her grandfather her mother she called your name once Mine It means nothing of course but the doctor thinks if she sees someone outside the family In a short time Martin was there Floyd went down to meet him neither spoke Floyd led the way upstairs They stopped at the door of the sick room and heard the cry of the delirious woman Martin I want Martin With a bound Martin flung himself on his knees beside the bed Julie Julie She opened her eyes heavy with fever they wandered about seeking seeking Julie She lifted herself into his arms He held her close whispering caressing words she listened her eyes fixed by the power of his soon the tired lids drooped she slept Martin felt the fluttering of her heart He had no sense of time place the world was unpeopled he was the only man she the only woman The doctor s watch registered forty minutes Mary looked at Floyd His eyes never left them his wife in his friend s arms The doctor laid the sleeping woman gently back on the pillow Martin dropped his head down on the bed helpless Miss Mary led him downstairs he fell in a heap in the chair He was conscious now of Floyd not the friend a stranger with a drawn face an icy voice What is there between you and my wife The ticking of a clock became distinctly sharp Should he tell the truth now No it would make it impossible for him to come again he would wait until she got well He put his hands on Floyd s shoulders looking him straight in the face Floyd repeated his question What is there between you and my wife What there has always been a deep affection You are trying to steal her from me How can you think that you told me yourself she called the names of others I lied She called no one but you Martin s face was telling tales he went over to the fireplace You are unjust to her but if you persist I won t come again His voice faltered his eyes filled up Floyd had never been able to resist him You two are my only friends if I lose you there is nobody nobody He went to the door then turned and put out his hand They were friends again to all appearances Mary jumped into the doctor s car and held a consultation She sat with her legs drawn up her elbows on her knees her little serious face puckered He liked her like that something was coming Well doctor said he She put her little head on the side and returned his glance She didn t smile as usual It s a psychosis The fever is not physical it s a condition of the mind I think she needs analysing His Scotch wrath broke over her head Stop that I won t have it with her this analysing has done too much mischief dragging the wild beasts out of their caverns showing the poor victims the horrors that are within them I tell you the people are playing with psycho analysis like children with dynamite they don t understand it nor do we yet Let that woman alone do you hear unless you want to rob her of the little reason she has left She s the victim of heredity we can t change that can we She s the victim of a certain physical tendency inborn we can t change that she s the victim of the errors of her ancestors we can t change that No Doctor but we all are if we knew it It s a good thing we don t Now I hope this woman s love for her child and her husband will counteract other influences mind you she s a good innocent woman but she is obsessed by an evil spirit which must be exorcised There he was the old Scotch Calvinist Julie was quiet until evening Where is Floyd Do you want to see him Yes Mary flew downstairs Floyd was trying to read the evening paper trying to be just to his wife his friend He hated to be suspicious it turned the honey of life to gall such thoughts made him ill he couldn t live with them He heard a patter patter Mary put her head in the door beckoning him He found Julie crushed into the pillows Miss Mary says I ve been out of my head Floyd was vexed Why did Miss Mary tell her that Did I say irrational things No just babbled a bit What did I say Only disconnected words without meaning She evidently didn t know what had happened Floyd smoked his pipe that night and read Emerson on Friendship Martin was to be pitied he was a lonely wretch he d give him the benefit of the doubt Mary came in to say good night Everything is all right We ll close up early She ll have a quiet night I hope The hope was not realized The sick woman had a terrible night her pulse was jumping like a frenzied thing but her mind was clear She clung frantically to Mary I m lost save me save me then she broke into convulsive sobbing always begging to be helped Mary shut the door carefully It wouldn t do for that poor man to hear Floyd tossed uneasily He was sure there was something mentally wrong with Julie he had heard of women getting queer after weaning a child He had been too harsh with Martin She had called him in her delirium that meant nothing Martin had wanted to marry her but it was all long forgotten she was his wife now the mother of his child it was foolish to make a fuss about a few moments of delirium Julie would never know about it What was that He jumped out of bed and listened He thought he heard somebody calling Martin Martin Julie s door was shut all was still It was his own imagination that cry was still in his ears He went back to bed he must get that idea out of his head he wouldn t let it become a mania with him He would see Martin often have him to dinner It was low of him to keep on thinking evil of them both The thought acted like a sedative he slept He was up and dressed before seven The night s depression descended again over him like a black veil There was a knock Mary stood outside pale agitated What is it What is it Come and see It was dark He saw Julie s figure lying across the bed she was in a deep sleep Mary opened a shutter gently He stifled an exclamation The long thick wavy hair flowing loosely over the pillow over her heart had turned white she lay in an ocean of foam What had happened to her in the night What had been at work in her brain he had heard vaguely of a sudden shock turning the hair white He gazed and gazed it was as if an artist had dipped his brush into molten silver and drawn it through every hair in her head Another long look then he went downstairs putting his hand on the balustrade to support himself Mary closed the shutter softly and followed him His mind was confused The ordeal with his wife culminating in this was too much he needed help She waited standing quietly beside him He felt her intense sympathy then he said in a low hushed voice What could have caused it It can easily be accounted for Your wife is subject to violent nervous headaches she had an attack in the night Was she sobbing Yes she suffered terribly We must be brave for her sake He looked at her standing there her eyes shining undaunted courageous Where did she get that spirit She was no longer only a nurse she was a comrade a fellow fighter her voice was like a call to arms I was always very happy he said I mean I thought it was happiness but I see now that it was like being under shelter when others were destitute that kind of happiness is selfish isn t it Yes said Mary That s why I try not to be too happy My parents were my only friends They left me I had only my wife Perhaps I wanted too much from her she was unfortunate in her family I should have taken better care I can t see ahead I don t know how this will affect her I I don t know It will be a blow but you can soften it for her I what can I do Mary hesitated Why was she obliged to say what he should have known intuitively did he love his wife Her heart would be at rest if you would convince her it doesn t matter to you what color her hair is He was on his feet his eyes averted You want me to tell her Yes He went to the door then came back Will you come with me It s better for you to go alone He entered his wife s room sat down beside the bed feeling like an intruder She awoke startled her eyes were deep with the sleep shadows of opiates Did I frighten you No but I felt someone was here Something has happened Tell me Yes Your hair What about my hair It has turned gray since last night She was out of bed with a bound standing before the mirror Let in the light He went from window to window the sun struck the surface of the looking glass dancing in and out of the silver veil that enveloped her She gave a low cry and shrunk away Julie don t grieve about what can t be helped it often happens from such headaches it s your nerves He wanted to say You will always be the same to me because I love you He couldn t It is not a symptom it is a punishment You have done nothing to deserve punishment She looked at him through him past him He didn t know her thoughts that door was closed to him I want to see Miss Mary Mary was surprised to find her patient sitting up in bed She had wound her hair in a tight coil around her head covering it with a heavy lace cap Miss Mary I am feeling better this morning I don t think I shall need you any longer Mary gasped Where was the exhausted creature of the night before the helpless invalid I m very glad Mrs Garrison Any time you send for me I will come Then she took Julie s hand bent forward and kissed her there was a slight quiver of the mouth Don t think I m ungrateful but I couldn t bear you to say anything it s unspeakable good bye Floyd was waiting in the hall when Mary came down with her hat on carrying her suitcase You are not going There is nothing more for me to do here Your wife is better the shock will cure her Then she smiled at him I m aching for the slums my cradle stood there there I learnt what life means when I get thinking too much of myself I go back and learn again He went with her to the door and held her hand in a strong grasp he could think of nothing worth saying A cloud of dust blew in their faces they were pulling down the little row of brick houses on the other side Floyd stopped in the hall to brush himself off The wreckers were working within him scattering debris He went up to his wife s room again listened there was no sound He turned the knob cautiously the door was locked There was a sense of relief he wouldn t have to spend the morning in that dark room He jumped into a taxi and drove to his club Julie gradually recovered there was a feeling of strength in her limbs a desire for movement she hadn t felt since the birth of her child it was the strength of despair One day she took out her pretty gowns and hung them one by one on silk hangers in the room next to her bedroom It had been Floyd s den he used to sit there at night during the first year of their marriage reading He could see his darling in her lace trimmed bed She complained she had no place to hang the Paris creations he bought for her he suggested putting racks around his den which they did those lace gold and silver gowns seemed to him to hang on bodies which swayed to and fro in the draught The face was always Julie s in her different moods The perfume stifled him He had an old fashioned idea about perfume his mother never used it He gave up reading there at night She put her hats in boxes her slippers stockings lingerie wrapped carefully in tissue paper in an old bureau a family relic which Floyd refused to sell it was two hours of fatiguing work but she wasn t tired She opened the door and peered out there was no one about she crept down the stairs went from room to room covered furniture and mirrors with gray linen and crept up again When Ellen came home with the boy she noticed her dark shining hair She dismissed her on the spot and rang up for the Japanese butler to come back Floyd was shocked to find the house so bare and cheerless Why have you had the covers put on again It s dusty The furniture will be ruined and we re not going to entertain He didn t answer When he saw the Japanese he asked for Ellen Oh I sent her away Why has she done anything wrong No but she annoys me she s too good looking Floyd feared his wife s mind was unbalanced she brooded too much over her misfortune He was very tender very indulgent but sometimes his patience gave out Days weeks months passed Winter came with snow ice sleet Julie spent most of the time in her room rarely going down to dinner Floyd tried to get her out for a walk but had to compromise with the automobile She d wear a hat pulled down over her eyes a thick veil a long close fitting coat and avoided Fifth Avenue The house remained covered Floyd begged her to take off those ugly depressing gray things but she sat silent antagonistic it always ended in his dashing out and spending the day at the club But his anger never lasted The pathetic figure crouching in a big chair those weary lustreless eyes hurt him terribly she had lost her beauty What is the elusive thing we call beauty It is not form it is not color it is something that pervades like the perfume of a flower in fresh earth or a haunting magic in the woods In a woman it is a living spark that sets us aglow that spark was dead in Julie he had to admit it The Image which he called by her name was blurred she would be an old miserable woman he an old disappointed man He spent much of his time at the club He d read his morning paper there He detested local politics The society column annoyed him Mrs C had run off with her chauffeur Mrs M was going to marry her riding master a well known woman was suing her millionaire husband for more alimony It was horrible to have one s domestic horrors made attractive reading he resolved no one should suspect his Then the paper would drop from his hand the green Park grow shadowy fade away he d awaken with a sense of guilt a young man dozing in his chair and all the unrest in the world He would look about furtively the others didn t notice they too were dozing One day he went home earlier than usual Julie with the boy in her arms was sitting at the window watching the workingmen on the iron frame of a building opposite they were knocking boring climbing in and out like monkeys it was fascinating She was conscious of her flannel wrapper Floyd was always well dressed well groomed his glance was like a sharp whip He took the boy from her and put him on the bed The child is heavy you must not accustom him to be carried about he makes the house unbearable with his cries It s all right to be a good mother but you are overdoing it you forget you have a husband She was on her feet facing him indignantly How can you speak to me like that You have no pity for my misfortune I m sorry if I have offended you but I don t see why you should be so sensitive about your hair You have become very neglectful you have lost all self respect I m ashamed of the servants Floyd I want to have Colonel Garland for dinner I have business with him No no I won t see him Very well It s not very pleasant for a married man to be obliged to invite his friends to a restaurant because his wife will not take the trouble to make herself presentable The dinner will be served whenever you order it but I will not come down You can do as you please about that I ll ask him for Wednesday Not so soon She was panic stricken My mother never needed to prepare Her table was always well supplied With this parting shot he went out Julie stood aghast her adoring slave was turning against her A man loves only beauty in a woman when she loses that she loses everything She was so young what was she going to do with the rest of her life She sat despairing trying to think herself out of the network of misery which entangled her She couldn t poor thing The present was a horror to her the future a blank She went back to the past lived it all over again and again Martin the joy of those secret meetings Hippolyte the side door which opened only wide enough to slip into the dark corridor there in Martin s arms The child cried she threw herself down beside him pressing him violently to her He struggled She held him tightly muttering unconsciously My body my Soul my little Martin peering into his face as if seeking something to console her These paroxysms of despair sapped her strength She was no longer apathetic but groping groping for some remedy She d go back always to those wonderful days with Martin She was religious at heart but she would have gladly given her hopes of redemption to be able to look into the mirror and see once more her young face her soft dark hair Hippolyte had admired her hair she saw him again so suave so handsome heard his exquisite French caught again the laughing significance of the looks which passed between the two men It was madly fascinating day and night it all repeated itself in her brain revolving like an ever turning wheel Martin Hippolyte Pierrot the sweet pungent odor of the place then the suggestion worked Hippolyte had often told them of his wonderful salves lotions hair restorers he might know a way to restore the color of her hair She looked up his address took the receiver in her hand a moment of fear irresolution then she called the number I want to speak to Hippolyte Oui Madame I am here His voice set her nerves quivering It s Mrs Garrison speaking You don t know my married name I was Julie Gonzola Madame I knew your voice How could I forget it Will you come and see me today at four Thank you She was terribly excited What would he think when he saw her now He must help her he must It was her last hope Punctually at four the boy knocked A gentleman downstairs She shrunk away she couldn t see him He says you expect him With a strong effort she controlled the impulse to send the man away Show him up Hippolyte looked curiously at Julie not grasping what had happened to her She was embarrassed didn t know what to say then she slipped off her cap and let her hair down It fell to the bottom of her dress He gasped and broke into a shower of compliments His admiration was evidently sincere Julie s spirits rose it was not all over My hair turned white when I was ill I want it restored to its natural color I can give you the shade Mais non Madame it is quite le dernier cri we are bleaching the hair now but we couldn t do it like this Madame Your hair will be the sensation it needs a little tonic oil and massage Then he looked at her again Madame is long indisposed Yes I have been in the house all winter Madame needs fresh air and the Swedish treatment the beauty will come back put yourself in my hands and you will see The Wednesday agreed on arrived Floyd left the house without seeing Julie he was getting used to that the entire morning she would be occupied with the boy always in a wrapper with that disfiguring cap on her She bathed dressed undressed the child like a professional nurse Floyd protested in vain On the way downtown he telephoned the house Is Madame awake yet Oh yes sir Connect me with her room will you Julie called Hello He thought her voice had more life in it than usual Julie do you remember I was to ask Colonel Garland to dinner tonight but if you are still against it I can postpone it Oh no The dinner is ordered Thank you He dropped the receiver with a guilty feeling Perhaps he had been too harsh He didn t know what to do about her he was quite helpless life was becoming unbearable Colonel Garland greeted Floyd with delight He was talking to a tall man in his private office who came up and shook hands You don t remember me Mr Garrison Floyd took in the tired face the dark rimmed eyes the deep lines Yes I do Are you still sweating blood for money No I m sweating blood to keep it Have you any left A few drops but I ll be bled white if this goes on He laughed mirthlessly said So long and left The Colonel looked after him speaking with a touch of pity and contempt That fellow made a million during the War it s been going the other way for some time and he s got a handsome extravagant wife Now if we pull down those old shanties near the river and build up big warehouses No no I m not a wrecker they bring enough for my modest wants That s just what your father said twenty years ago You re getting very much like him Floyd didn t take that as a compliment The men of twenty years ago were a century behind the times Then rather timidly hoping for a refusal he said Will you come and take pot luck with me tonight My wife s not well she can t join us I must find some congenial occupation We ll talk it over The Colonel was all animation Politics We need young men We ve got a job on our hands to rebuild the world Late in the afternoon they went to the Republican Club for a cocktail from the Colonel s private stock There were the usual jokes about Prohibition being a good law for others On alighting from the car Floyd was surprised to see the soft red gleam of the colored glass fixture over the porch The filmy lace window curtains through which the light shone were not there when he left the house that morning before he could take out his latch key the door was swung open The Jap in spotless white smiled a welcome they entered the parlor By God cried the Colonel this is something like A beautiful color that velvet Floyd smiled Mulberry they call it The chairs the sofa with its cushions were like old friends he saw again those well loved water colors his mother looking down at him and through the door the glimpse of a beautifully set dinner table a picture covered for a long time once more in the light Julie came swiftly toward them extending her hand to the Colonel She was in a state of excitement like an actress who makes her d but in a new r le Her color came and went A crescent of black plaster deepened the darkness of her eyes The despised hair revenged itself with its beauty it was mounted in shining rippling masses on the top of her head She wore a soft white gown embroidered with seed pearls a train of gold sweeping the ground Her arms and neck were free of ornament in her corsage a large red American Beauty rose At dinner she kept up a flow of small talk accentuated by soft glances winning smiles The Colonel listened as if every word were a new truth the usual platitudes taking on a mysterious significance He was sixty held himself very erect could easily be taken for ten years younger and he loved the ladies Floyd was silent trying to overcome a queer feeling Was this gracious smiling woman his wife Was he sitting at his own table Who was he anyhow The Colonel s stentorian voice with its agreeable Southern accent broke in on his confused mental condition If you will permit me to tell you how much I admire your perfect taste in dress You know what suits you an inspiration to powder your hair Oh laughed Julie it s not powdered it s natural It runs in our family to turn gray early My father was white at twenty one The gallant Colonel turned this to his credit My dear Mistress Garrison Nature has been your Fairy Godmother she has waved her wand over your head bestowing one charm more the gift of original beauty The evening passed quickly in light persiflage Floyd listening as if he were in the auditorium of a theatre At the door the Colonel gave one look back He could have fought a duel for her We haven t had a chance to talk business said Floyd Who could with such a radiant vision before us laughed the Colonel Come down to the office Floyd went back to Julie Thank you for making such a sacrifice It sounded foolish but he didn t know what to say She came closer to him He was afraid to touch her she was like a strange woman in his house That soft sensual smile set him on fire She slid into his arms he kissed her neck hair her lips she let herself be adored His love had been ideal in those early wonderful days of his marriage He reverenced his wife he was afraid to repel her He had heard of some men whose wives hated them for their lack of consideration Julie laughed at his innocence He often wondered if she appreciated being his first love he couldn t answer that now after four years He ceased trying to probe her soul he worshipped her body In the physical intoxication of the next few months he forgot all his plans for future activity Love can be a despot or a liberator Floyd was in chains again When it was known the Garrisons had come back they were deluged with invitations Do you want to go Of course what s the use of Paris gowns if I can t make the other women green She was in good humor now caressed spoilt every wish fulfilled He gave her a new car a gorgeous thing fitted up like a boudoir trying to shake off a sickening consciousness that he was buying her favors He pulled wires for a box at the opera it was an achievement to get one she rewarded him with a long kiss he developed a prodigality which astounded the Colonel You re going it my boy You re beyond your income Oh sell something laughed Floyd I must have money The Colonel didn t like the flippant answer the restless way He wasn t quite certain but it seemed once or twice the boy had been drinking He had noticed since Prohibition many sober men had taken to drink psychologically interesting the resistance to personal restraint The opening night of the opera Julie was the centre of attraction She had taken the family jewels out of the safe deposit A great cluster of diamonds set in antique silver shone on her velvet bodice of old wine a glittering aigrette in her hair which was no longer an old gray treatment had changed it into the mat silver which one sees on the head of a marble statue with life added to its charm She stood in the box in her velvet wrap Floyd took it off with a feeling of excitement He felt the sensation she created he was running a blooded mare for the first prize Maud sat in front with Tom Dillon She had played her last trump in the game of matrimony It wasn t a King now but a Knave who cared for her she was sure of that For the rest she looked into her mirror and saw her future it spelt wrinkles Who is that gorgeous creature Don t you know your friend Julie Garrison She put up her lorgnette What has she done with her hair Bleached it Catch up Maudy A celebrated cocotte in Paris has made white hair the rage she looks like one doesn t she Yes she does wonderful I always said Julie had great possibilities there s something about her that attracts men Look at Martin He was standing against a post opposite the box His eyes fastened on Julie his mouth twisted into a derisive smile the Colonel was there pouring out his usual compliments Men were coming in and out old club friends of Floyd s all eager to renew their acquaintance Julie s illness had upset all his calculations but there was one cause for satisfaction she had wanted him he had saved her she belonged to him not Floyd He was waiting for a propitious moment she must tell Floyd the truth He waited because he was not sure of her after a long siege of fever the blood cools off He dropped in one day at Hippolyte s Parlor he went there now to hear about Julie Madame was going to have a dinner party he had made a supreme effort The phenomenon of her hair had given him a great deal of thought He was in his way a scientist the psychic side of it interested him You must see her superb hair it suits her to perfection It gives the last touch of that Je ne sais quoi which she lacked It was caused in my opinion by some intense subconscious passion Martin bent over eagerly A psychic power which acts like the eruption of a volcano it tears her agonizes her she struggles with it is not quite able to translate it yet Her husband is a nice fellow mais vous savez Puritanism the narrow path he ll never deceive her nor pardon her if she deceives him That little house is no frame for a woman like her She needs life sparkle passion Voila tout During the next few months Hippolyte s mademoiselle brought now and again a deep red rose and set it in an exquisite glass vase on Julie s dressing table Julie asked no questions her eyes glistened She furtively put the rose to her lips then she d sit for hours under the hands of the French woman massage electric treatment hot cold until her body exhaled an indefinable intoxicating perfume Maud and Tom made their way to the Garrison box Julie with a keen woman s look saw at once that Maud s gown jewelry furs were no longer imitations Tom was evidently embarrassed and hung back Floyd rather liked him he was genuine he didn t disguise the fact that he was a rotter He said I m no good take me as I am or not at all What have you been doing all this time Oh nothing much laughed Maud shopping house hunting getting married we didn t announce it it wasn t worth while Floyd grasped Tom s hand I couldn t get her any other way so we called on the Judge We ve been married six weeks so far it s all right I m going to buy a house and put it in her name If I don t behave myself she can kick me out Maud was sitting in front with Julie talking over joining the young matrons and giving a series of dinners Suddenly she said Have you seen Martin Steele lately I ve been ill a long time He s here tonight Yes I saw him standing at the back He looks awful doesn t he Julie didn t answer Maud said afterwards to her husband Julie was always different from the rest of us she was queer tonight didn t hear a word I said I m certain she s not all there As they were going out they passed Martin Come with us to the dancing club Tom s sure to take too much you can help me get him home Martin went but it was Tom who had to take Martin home abusingly drunk fighting like a beast That night Julie had dreams and talked in her sleep She flung her arms around Floyd I m so glad you love me just the same Floyd was a happy man He had finished his breakfast and was looking out of the front window waiting for his wife to awaken Floyd Floyd He went up the stairs three at a time She held out her arms to him Floyd we must move away from here the street is getting impossible A crash of falling timbers next door strengthened her position Julie This is our home you know how I love it How can you ask me such a thing He was losing his temper she was on the verge of tears and last night when he held her in his arms he swore they all do at those times I ll do anything for you anything but my home is a part of me you don t realize how I love it More than me She was pouting now like a child Oh no different you won t ask me to leave it will you It was pathetic the appeal in the man s voice But I also loved my home I left it for you He was about to say It s not the same The roots of my life are here you are an alien He didn t want to offend her then he went down to see the Colonel and mentioned with much embarrassment that the street was getting unbearable Yes it s very unhealthy for your wife and child to inhale all that dust We ve secured a house Oh have you My wife didn t tell me No she wanted to give you an agreeable surprise It s on Park Avenue We ve rented it for the winter He didn t add with the privilege of buying that was to be kept secret He liked to be in conspiracy with Julie against her husband It s perfection we ve secured it with servants wine cellar everything complete Floyd went home and compromised with Julie The furnished house for the winter only he was grateful she had not insisted on going to a fashionable hotel A camp in the mountains for the summer and in the autumn when the street was built up to return to the old home Julie was satisfied with the bargain The house would be impossible shut in on both sides the walls were cracking everything was going to pieces She would never go back Floyd stood at the door of the car waiting for the bunch to come down the boy the nurse the Pekinese countless bags dress suit cases last minute bundles and Julie very much excited She had gone back for the little glass vase which had been forgotten He was physically tired mentally agonized he cast one look back and jumped into the car He had a peculiar feeling he was the automobile Julie was driving The house in Park Avenue was the very last word Floyd had to confess that The walls tinted a cold gray the light coming from invisible corners telephones a radio cabinet china closets hidden behind panels the entire floor could be made into a dancing hall by pushing the doors into the wall no fireplace very little furniture meals rolled in ready to serve by the haughty Swede hired with the house everything cooked la mode by a chef also hired with the house Julie was hysterical with joy she had been all her life the victim of antiques this was all so exquisitely modern Floyd thought with intense longing of his little home he vowed to himself he would not desert it he d go there every day and read his evening paper The house warming was to be a brilliant affair Maud with her restless activity schemed various plans for a sensational success Tom sampled the cellar it was perfection Floyd was dispatched here there and everywhere Julie sat back and gave the others carte blanche Don t consult me she said you three will do it all right On the day of the dinner Julie had been the entire afternoon in the hands of Hippolyte s skilled lieutenants He himself was to come later and give her hair the last touches True to his resolve Floyd had spent his afternoons in the little house reading his paper but he was beginning to feel a superstitious dread when he put the key in the door That day the room seemed unbearably chilly he lit the fire with great difficulty The wood piled up in a basket was damp it sputtered awhile gave out sighs as if it were in pain Soon the fretful flame died out He couldn t read looked at his watch and went home The perfume from his wife s room pervaded the house His room was on the floor above they had become fashionable He saw less and less of Julie she had no time for him she was wrapped up in herself her looks her gowns vanity had developed in her to such an extent it staggered him she sought admiration was a slave to style adopting the daily change no matter how extreme a night at home was unbearable to her he dragged himself along he wasn t jealous of the crowd of men always around her but it wouldn t look well for the husband to be absent He hadn t seen Martin for a very long time He was sure Julie had forgotten him she couldn t love anyone but herself he pulled himself up he mustn t think that way He remembered her as a girl so yielding so sweet Illness changes the character of people sometimes He must be patient with her but life had become very hard the nights were spent in carousing He didn t know what to do with his days until Julie woke up and he was only thirty He dressed and went down to his wife s door his Mecca it was open Hippolyte with a strand of her hair over his shoulder was bending down talking confidentially Floyd abominated him a man who could make a fortune out of the vanity of women was despicable but most fortunes are directly or indirectly made out of the vanity of women Floyd come in I ve such news for you I ve sold our house What house Our little house to Hippolyte You re mad Julie gave him a quick surprised look and got rid of Hippolyte Floyd you shouldn t speak to me like that before Hippolyte he ll tell the next customer we quarrel There was a suspicion of tears Julie you re mad quite mad What the devil can he do with our house He ll make a fortune out of it if he follows my advice the first floor will be a fine Colonial tea room the old furniture and our kitchen coppers will be just the thing the second floor a beauty parlor and above in your father s workshop a Turkish bath And she could sit there calmly and say such things The Colonel came in early poured out a volley of compliments which put her in good humor She whispered to him I ve won he s getting used to it The dinner was delayed until past ten waiting for Maud and Tom who arrived with profuse apologies Tom had been running all day from one shop to another trying to find a string of beads for Maud Costly things those glass beads said Tom Reminds me of the squaws up in the Reservation when I was travelling with whiskey they had them around the waist neck legs through the ears and nose and by God they thought they were in full dress When the dancing commenced Julie was surrounded she was the prettiest woman in the room and a wonderful dancer Floyd in the next room among some loose fellows was drinking heavily The sedans were not ordered back chauffeurs gossip among themselves and after twelve the guests were going slumming Taxis were engaged Masks and dominos were put on in the hall one not knowing who the other was Maud had done the pairing she saw to it that husband and wife did not meet Tom was to have Julie Maud selected Floyd he wouldn t make love to her The masked figures in dominos slipped past the sentinel at the door he was the devil who was sending souls to Hell that night Floyd wanted to fight everybody then broke down and blubbered Tom had a fellow feeling put him in a chair and told the haughty Swede to look after him At the door he got mixed up in the crowd found himself with someone in a taxi A pair of soft lips met his he shouted for joy Maudy where s Julie She laughed Oh she s in very good company She nestled up to him Don t think of her only ourselves Let s make believe we re not married The taxis were speeding downtown Julie took off her mask leaned back she was excited warm from dancing Her companion bent over her She looked into flaming eyes Julie That hour in Martin s arms she forgot her husband her child herself promised him everything This time he swore she should keep her word Floyd had an insane desire to smash things He threw a bottle of wine into the glass and china on the table overturning the electric candles the fuse burnt out putting the room in darkness He laughed hysterically He was on a ship in a terrible storm the ground was slipping away billows were rising on all sides Hey there steward damn it where s my cabin The haughty Swede lifted him like a child carried him into the elevator which took them up to the servants quarters unlocked a small door at the extreme end of the hall it was an unused room with one lamp hanging from the ceiling He put Floyd on the sofa lit the lamp and carefully shut the door he didn t want the master s ravings to be heard The caterer s men were still in the house Some might inform a raid would lose him his place When Floyd awoke the lamp sputtered in fitful gleams His head was like lead his tongue parched there was a sense of deep humiliation waves of shame higher than the ocean He looked about the room It was in disorder boxes piled up in a corner a large desk strewn with papers at the door stood the Swede Where am I Whose room is this This is a room we keep closed sir Why The master killed himself here the mistress locked the door and gave me the key she ordered me not to open it until she came again She didn t come Where is she In Paris sir He killed himself and she went to Paris Yes sir shot himself He was a fine man sir a very fine man When I came in to announce dinner he was lying on that sofa where you are the blood pouring out Floyd was on his feet quite sober now There were heavy dark stains on the gray rep The man answered Floyd s questioning look That s blood sir and this and this The gray rug was stained in dark red there were splashes of it on the white wall Why did you put me in here Because the house was full of strange people I didn t want them to see you like that Thank you I m much obliged to you Shall I bring you a little whiskey and soda No thank you I m not a drinker I see that sir said the man A cup of strong black coffee will set you all right Thank you Floyd looked about the room On the desk there was a box half filled with cigars stationery postage stamps everything just as the unhappy man had left them The Swede came in with some strong black coffee which Floyd swallowed Colonel Garland told me to give you this when you came to It was a large legal envelope Floyd took it mechanically flung it on the desk When you are ready sir I ll lock up here Floyd stood fascinated It was the only room in that big house that meant something more than wood marble The desk was littered the pigeon holes stuffed with papers the deep armchairs the heavy draperies belonged to former days the man must have had trouble with his wife about it she had put him and his old sticks in the garret The legal envelope was lying on the desk where he had thrown it He took out a typewritten document The little house was in his wife s name The Colonel had suggested it as a wedding gift It was only a matter of form it was the custom for a man to put the home in the wife s name Floyd laughingly assented What did it matter All he had was hers himself included Here it was in black and white sold on easy terms to Hippolyte at the bottom was written in her large clear hand Julie Abravanel Gonzola Garrison she had done it without consulting him she had the right The monotonous voice of the Swede broke the silence He was a very fine man sir and a liberal man She was a beauty that s her picture On the desk was a colored print of a woman in bridal costume all lace satin orange blossoms an enormous bouquet half hiding her face it was like the wax models one sees in a show window The Swede took a photo out of his pocket and handed it to Floyd This is the master I asked him for it the night before he died I was very fond of him his voice broke Floyd knew that care lined face The man who sweated blood He shivered He tried to pull himself together the horror of it struck him down He staggered against the desk on it lay an open letter crushed together as if thrown there in haste his eye caught unconsciously what was written It s over I ve made superhuman efforts everything is gone I was afraid to tell you the last time you demanded money throwing up to me I hadn t made good I told you this house would ruin us but you didn t care What s the good of a man who can t pay out I ve begged and begged this is the last time You said you couldn t be poor and there are others That s always in my ears I see now what a fool I ve been I ve spent my best years scheming for money and you took it and flung it in the air I ve had nothing from my life nothing It s too late to commence again Come back Come back Floyd shuddered He looked again at the blood stains he saw the man with a pistol in his hand It wasn t a fair exchange his soul for her body He sat in the big chair that other man must have crouched there with the pistol in his hand He had usurped a sanctuary bought with money what another had built with blood I m ready to lock up the room sir He staggered to his feet thrust the legal envelope in his pocket went downstairs and into the street The sedans rolled up and down the avenue People stepped out in front of brilliantly lit residences a happy care free crowd or were they like him a lie He moved mechanically elbowing his way through the mass of theatre goers gradually getting down into the business district quiet dark He stood before his old home huddled together as if shrinking away from the giant buildings on either side unlocked the door there was an odor like a crypt He struck a match lit the half burnt candle on the hall stand held it high peering into the corners through open doors taking in every well known detail the straight back mahogany chairs covered with mulberry velvet the tidies He could see the shuttle in his mother s delicate fingers dancing in and out of the white thread the rag rugs made by his grandmother People were hunting for them in little country villages antiquarians were reproducing them by thousands but these were his rags He went slowly up the narrow stairs the creaking of the boards used to anger him when his mother was ill He looked out at the desolate garden through little glass panes just large enough for a boy s face He saw himself again gloating over the first snow storm running down to the cellar for his sled his feet dancing impatiently whilst Prudence tied the soft warm shawl she had knitted for him about his head and neck He stopped at the first landing The old clock was covered with dust he found the key inside wound it set it right its ticking echoed through the house it seemed to him like a human thing whose heart had stopped for fright then commenced to beat again in glad relief He opened the door of the bedroom Here he had brought his bride here his boy was born here he had watched Martin holding his wife in his arms On the dressing table was a faded rose it fell to pieces in his hand He went up to his father s workshop the images took on life in the flicker of the candle light the Negro the Italian shoe boy his mother clasping him in her arms an unfinished bust of his father Rip Van Winkle with his head smashed he took it all in a life picture the background stretching out in the full sunlight of generations an old landscape He was framed in it he himself that self simple sentimental ideal old fashioned the self that was not cynical reckless material and all the things we call modern He scented the smell of fallen plaster felt the shaking of timbers the wreckers had him under the hammer destroying his foundations The table was littered with old newspapers and rags used in modelling he stood for a moment motionless like a man offering a sacrifice on the altar of his domestic gods then he dropped the candle Little flames started here there grew bigger the illumination cast a glow over his mother s face She smiled at him He shut the door groping his way downstairs at the gate he stopped to listen to the clear chime of the clock as it struck one two three There was no trace of the night orgy in the Park Avenue mansion He went up to his wife s room she was in bed sleeping quietly The soft shaded lamp which burnt through the night she had a horror of darkness cast a soft rosy glow Was this beautiful creature lying there his wife No No a legalized mistress and he a sensualist In that moment passion burnt up in him the body of love the Idol fell in ashes He took the bill of sale from his pocket put it beside her on the bed then went slowly up to his room shut the door and burst into a loud laugh The next morning at breakfast he read the press headings The old Garrison homestead destroyed by fire a total loss on account of Mr Garrison s neglect to renew the insurance Fire caused by a cigarette or cigar stump thrown carelessly from one of the tall adjacent buildings The house was a tinder box Fortunately the family had moved to their palatial residence on Park Avenue He marked the notices with red pencil and sent them up on his wife s breakfast tray He heard the maid knocking and Julie s voice saying Come in He could see her opening the papers reading the marked lines there was a loud cry and a heavy fall he went up quickly She was lying on the floor rigid the paper clutched in her hand it was impossible to bring her to He telephoned for Dr McClaren who came at once Floyd told him about the fire in a few words It must have been a great shock to her said the doctor I don t know answered Floyd The doctor looked at him curiously then went into Julie s room He brought her to insisted on her resting that day in bed and said to Floyd She ll be all right There s no cause for worry I ve seen her like that before Julie believed with all her superstitious secretive soul that her hair turning white had been a punishment for giving in to her suppressed passion for Martin and last night in that very hour of burning joy their house was in flames What did it mean What was that unseen revengeful Power preparing for her perhaps another blow a physical deformity With a cry of terrible fear she sprang out of bed locked the door stood before the long mirror examining herself closely not like a beautiful woman exulting over her reflected beauty but with the fear of a guilty soul seeking the brand of further punishment What now What now Her body was spotless like white marble with a delicate tracery of blue veins She gave a long sigh of relief The reporters besieged the house Floyd had the agony of seeing himself his wife his child in every newspaper The weeklies had colored prints of the beautiful Mrs Garrison She might have stepped out of a picture a living Greuze the grace of a French Dame de Salon the Art of Conversation lives again then the Russian players arrived Julie did not get over the shock Her nerves always abnormal snapped she sank into a state of melancholy Floyd went up to her room one morning to tell her he wouldn t be home to dinner she was still in bed crouching among the pillows Are you waiting for Hippolyte There was a touch of irony in his voice I ve sent him away I don t want him any more Then she broke into sobs Floyd was glad to get that shame out of the house Julie was beginning to mope again she needed fresh air he would look for a camp in the Adirondacks for the summer Julie brooded about her promise to Martin the revulsion had set in as usual she was again the mother the conventional wife She was afraid of his anger she must keep away from him All sorts of horrors took form in her diseased mind The clock struck twelve The boy had gone to the Park with the nurse a French girl who spoke little English they were late She saw the child run over by a car lying mangled under the wheels she was in a paroxysm of fear a distracted neurasthenic woman Mamma see what I ve got She caught the boy in her arms passionately kissing his eyes his mouth his hair a handsome fellow big for his age his eyes gleaming with excitement Mamma Mamma He took from Mademoiselle a beautiful perfectly equipped motor boat Mademoiselle explained A big dark Monsieur belhomme gave it to Joseph He said he was his Uncle Martin He taught him to float and sink it She couldn t get the child away that s why they were so late The boy took the boat to pieces and put it together again with great dexterity He was uncommonly intelligent See Mamma this is the cabin He pressed a spring which opened a little door in the bottom of the boat within lay a neatly folded paper the handwriting was Martin s Mademoiselle took the boy away looking back furtively with her French comprehension at Madame A few lines begging commanding her to come with the boy the following day She knew she would go she couldn t stay away He would hold Joseph in his arms she would take his kisses from the boy s lips her eyes gleamed She would go it would end as it must She was lost Hopelessly lost She went to the Park every day for a week leaving the maid at home the boy was always there sailing his boat One day Martin took him up suddenly pressed him in his arms kissed him again and again Julie looked on the blood leaping into her face They were her kisses Then the boy put his arms around Martin whispering I love you Uncle Martin and fell asleep Martin carried him to the car motioned Julie to get in first laid the child beside her covered him up with the rug then spoke in low tones of suppressed pain You committed a crime against me Julie That boy should have been mine All night and the next day Julie had one of those terrible headaches Floyd couldn t bear her moans of pain Dr McClaren took off his coat and goloshes stopping on the spiral staircase to admire the beautiful colored glass windows He found Julie crouching in a chair her hands icy her eyes roving restlessly My dear Madame I m sorry to see you in this nervous state What is it tell me I can t help you unless I know Is it your husband No he is too good The boy then No What is troubling you Tell me Day and night I have a terrible fear that something dreadful is going to happen I ve had it often but controlled it with a strong effort Since the night of the fire it has come back with terrible force I suffer tortures When you go out do you feel as if someone were following you to do you harm Yes yes she had her eyes fixed on the boat It seemed to have a terrible fascination for her The doctor took the boat from the table turning it over in his hands He was thoughtful puzzled How perfectly they make these toys Yes it floats and sinks like a real motor boat The suggestion gave the doctor an idea Do you like the water Oh yes Wouldn t you like to take a long sea trip to Europe for instance I would like it very much I ll speak to your husband about it No no I don t want him You want to go without him Yes He leaned forward to catch her words which came in low gasps I want to to slip away without anybody knowing If you can persuade Floyd to let me go alone you ll find him at his club The doctor dropped off at the club that day and spoke to Floyd He was sitting in the window gazing idly at the green square opposite what Floyd saw there were flames mounting higher and higher wherever he went they followed him scorching him the world was one great funeral pyre the flames were drawing him in Your wife is slipping back into the old condition of melancholia we must prevent that Doctor I do all I can When he suggested a trip to Europe Floyd gave a quick cry No no I couldn t I want her to go alone The same look of relief he had seen on Julie s face A pity married so short a time I would like Miss Mary to go with her but she is always so busy Floyd was on his feet She ll go if I ask her I m sure she will Miss Mary was at home in her little flat on the East Side of downtown The cry of a newly born child came through the window She smiled her ears distinguished the sex A girl fretted wailed in a high pitched nagging tone a boy fought bellowed Yes this was a girl Mary wondered how many men she would make miserable that would depend on her face What children men are They marry a complexion teeth eyes When they get at the woman it s too late Some kick over the traces most of them remain in harness from a sense of honor The patience married people have with each other is wonderful considering they are like dice thrown together by accident She thought of the Garrisons and drew two lines on a piece of paper one a parallel that stood for him he thought in straight lines The other broken with angles that was she She wondered if he understood that mysterious side of his wife She saw his eyes always trying to look happy his sensitive mouth trying to say pleasant things A knock at the door startled her there he stood surrounded by the bare footed little devils of the neighborhood They had piloted him up the dark stairs A little gold head slipped her hand in his He bent down and kissed her dirty face then he distributed all his small change amongst them and shut them out I ve had a time finding you Miss Mary I ve never been in this neighborhood before You should get acquainted with it it s more interesting than Park Avenue Poverty is terrible No it s wonderful it keeps people human But here there is no poverty the people earn their living Such as it is He looked around the room There was a cot in an alcove a few chairs a table a shelf of books and she smiling at him You re not feeling well Mr Garrison Oh I m well enough but the springs are giving way We must brace them up Impossible they are broken Then we ll have to get you new springs How young she was how happy and the bare room here was no ego that wants and wants always taking never giving no expectations no disappointment Selflessness that s what kept her so buoyant Can I help you Yes if you will Then he told her of Julie s relapse and the prescribed sea voyage Dr McClaren wants her to go without me he thinks it will be better for her You know her so well what is your opinion Your wife is organically healthy but there are pathological conditions a radical change might do her good She avoided his eyes he was disappointed but what else could she say He bent a little nearer Miss Mary if you will go with her my mind would be at rest She sat silent a moment I m sorry but I cannot I ve pledged myself You are engaged She laughed clapping her hands like a child To be married you mean Oh no I shall never marry He laughed with her like a boy Not if you fall terribly in love Not even then Her eyes shone defiantly I ve made a promise to myself and I won t be a deserter A promise to yourself Yes don t you sometimes No You should or life would become too accidental we would be terribly tossed about That s what s happening to me I am looking for some occupation but I don t want to get into a treadmill The people toil at business pleasure they do the same thing day after day year after year Life is a habit a deadening monotony She drew up her knees clasped her hands over them bent forward She was a quaint little thing he had never known anyone like her She spoke slowly with difficulty the words she had at her command couldn t adequately express her thoughts Life is a gift not a habit Every day we do the same things but they must bring us something new in the doing I ve often thought in the quiet of the sick room what a privilege it is that I could sit there and help when all the millions and billions of spirits are crowding the universe and can t get into life I m so glad I am put into a body so happy so thankful I have never thought it a privilege to live never thought of life as a gift We depend too much on people and things to make us happy we shouldn t Our happiness depends on no one but ourselves He knew what she meant Julie had colored his life for a time now it was grey I ve never thought of it that way She came nearer with a touch of eagerness You will won t you He answered simply Yes I will Then she went to the table and took up one of a pile of opened letters I have pledged myself to something which will take all my time all my strength and that isn t very much No said Floyd Nursing is gradually becoming a money making trade During the War women seeking adventure with little knowledge were extravagantly paid Now money is no longer easy but prices remain high Only people of means can afford a trained nurse there is a great need You don t know how sick people are neglected for want of care I am trying to bring together earnest women of all classes there are so many who want to do something and don t know how I have appeals from all over the country piteous cries from women whose lives are empty their school will be the bedside of the poor You don t know how quickly they learn when their heart is in it They pledge themselves to go wherever they are called without regard to payment like the nuns in the early days of Christianity We are getting together a fund to pay their living When they are not working they will study we will have our own home our own hospital It has only been whispered but you have no idea how easy it is to get money She showed him a letter signed by a well known millionaire who guaranteed a large sum There are many rich women eager to join us who are seeking for something better something nobler in their lives you don t know you don t know No he didn t know I feel very small annoying you with my personal affairs when you are doing such great things He made his way to the door Life was hopeless again Wait She was agitated she couldn t let him go like that because she loved him She knew it now A wave of gladness rushed through her She had loved everybody all her life but this love was like a wonderful magic touch transporting her into some distant fairy world She stood by the window he saw the light on her face I think I can manage it I want to go to London to the headquarters of the Salvation Army to Zurich to confer with the Red Cross Sisters if your wife will go with me it will not be neglecting my duty He grasped her hand Thanks thanks I ll never forget this never He saw the blood surging up to her temples receding leaving her white Her eyes were longing pleading they sought his She was beautiful his heart gave a great bound He stood looking looking stammered something then turned and went out The next few days he was kept busy about the cabins rugs passports exchange There was a feeling of warmth He saw Mary standing there with that look in her face he saw the woman for the first time How wonderful she was What a wife she would make He hoped she wouldn t marry No man was good enough He found himself thinking too much about her then he went and bought something costly for Julie He refused to stay alone in the house with that French woman He coaxed Bridget back to take care of the boy while his wife was away He wondered why Julie didn t write to her friends I don t want anyone to know I am going Not even Maud Dillon They ve moved away somewhere He hadn t seen Tom about town as usual How people disappear when their money is gone and nobody misses them The car was waiting at the door Julie with a throb of pride took the boy once more in her arms The child was beautiful in his velvet suit and lace collar You won t forget me Joseph No Mother She placed her photograph on the table beside his little bed You will say good night to me I will hear it I will say good night to you you will hear it Yes Mother She put the worn Hebrew prayer book in his hands You will read the prayer I taught you every morning every evening Yes Mother The boy s eyes fixed on her face grew deeper there was a psychic connection between them She went back to her own childhood She saw an old man with that book in his hand his face lit with religious fervor Julie you will say the prayer I taught you every morning every evening Yes Grandfather She had kept her promise The steamer sailed Mary remained on deck to get a last glimpse of the solitary man standing on the wharf Julie gave Floyd s flowers to the steward to put on the dining table there was a bouquet of exquisite red roses in her cabin When they landed she wore one in her corsage The earth was thirsty it poured down for three days a slow soaking rain Martin thought it would never stop He walked along the lake in the Park regardless of his dripping hat He was aching to see the boy again to hear him say in his mother s soft voice I love you Uncle Martin What a mess he had made of his life now he must steal what rightly belonged to him He exulted in his power over Julie Her illness was a fatality it was her mother s dead hand that had struck her daughter down to save her from him A shiver ran through him why was he so superstitious He didn t believe in anything but sometimes a peculiar feeling took hold of him there was another life far back a mystery something intangible He walked hours in the rain fighting invisible forces cursing the conditions of his life it all resolved itself back to the same determination She had promised to go with him she must keep her word Towards evening he rang the side door bell at Hippolyte s hoping to get some news of her The dark skinned valet whisked off his coat dried his dripping hair and neck and preceded him into the Turkish room behind the shop It was Hippolyte s hour of rest before the night s activity he was lying on a divan a picturesque figure in a loose red silk robe He waved Martin a welcome with his small white hand the diamond set in platinum on his finger flashing rose color in the soft electric glow of the pervading red Sapristi Monsieur Steele I was thinking of you Martin dropped down in a deep chair stretched out his legs The aroma of coffee and a whiff of perfumed opium lent a sense of warmth to his chilled body Of me Are you in trouble again His pipe dream visions changed into the cold reality of a check book he had often helped the man out of his financial difficulties he earned enormous sums but the overhead expenses were fabulous The money is nothing it comes in and goes out like the tide I am at the end the compass changes We must in Life watch for the Warning We must train our ear to detect the direction of the wind You are superstitious We all are if we knew its true meaning Superstition is an intense sense of the Invisible Martin drank the strong Turkish coffee puffing at his chibouk The man was a hairdresser but that didn t matter Martin had no sense of class My time in this business will soon be over I was the only one for years when it was an elite profession Now it is vulgarized like everything else There is a clever Russian woman who is taking all my customers do you know why The husbands are jealous Martin laughed he understood that he would never allow this fascinating purring Greek to maul his wife about Mon ami I know what you are thinking you are wrong They talk a great deal about the immorality of the American woman It is not so and it is a shame that it is not so The French woman is honest she have her husband her lover he has his wife his mistress Marriage is a success in France they do not go about divorcing themselves Here marriage is a failure because every woman young middle age old talk of love it is only talk mon ami talk talk but she do nothing nothing Why because she is afraid the fear is in her blood from the old times in America the fear of the Scarlet Letter Oh she can love Mon Dieu and if by accident there is just a little false step she make a scene her relatives make a scene the press make a scene everybody make a scene Oh your Hawthorne did not know what harm he was doing to the future women of his country The French authors knew better La nouvelle Heloise Camille the heroines of de Maupassant have set the women of France a glorious example Martin smiled The fellow was clever insolent Do you know how it will end No my imagination doesn t take me any farther Bah it is easy she will go back to the pale face and the straight hair You will see the little Puritan again They have already forbid us the wine the splendid opium the tobacco silk stockings cosmetics love the whole nation will go to bed at nine o clock and their money will choke them Martin laughed but the man was very serious he put his hand on Martin s shoulder Mon ami you have been good to me You know the Figaro has the soul of an artist I am going to be good to you I am going to tell you something you do not know Mrs Garrison will sail Saturday for England without her husband The Garrison shanties near the river were kept in as good condition as possible but time and rats gnawed at their foundations On one of these the passer could read with some difficulty the faded letters of an old sign Martin Steele and Son Established Since Mr Steele s death the business had been carried on by a Mr Waldbridge who knew and followed the old conservative methods of the defunct Steeles Young Mr Steele was expected to take his father s place as head of the firm but he stayed away took what money he wanted a ridiculously small amount for a man of his means leaving the surplus in the business Waldbridge had written several times asking him to come down and look over the books Finally he appeared He was a mystery to Mr Waldbridge all the young business men of the day were eager speculators He had expected new ideas a business revolution but no such things happened He would sit about watch closely the proceedings but made no suggestions His visits grew less and less frequent What does he do with himself thought Mr Waldbridge He doesn t gamble He s never seen at the races or baseball games His name has never been connected with women What kind of a man is he Martin sat opposite him in the private office flung his soft hat on the floor crossed his long legs his hair was disarranged his face a yellow pallor his clothes hung loosely he was very thin His appearance struck Mr Waldbridge as very un American he himself being an Erie Road commuter with all the proud consciousness of a one hundred per cent Nationalism He spoke cautiously of the hard times and unsatisfactory business conditions They had advanced money on large stocks of merchandise there was nothing to do but to hold on If they forced the sale it would mean enormous losses Yes I know interrupted Martin impatiently We couldn t go on gorging money at that rate we d have to vomit it up sometime No stomach could hold it that s what we re doing now Some people die suddenly from it we ll have a lingering end Waldbridge laughed uneasily really a very unpleasant young man I hope we will weather it I ve been discounting and Martin interrupted again discounting meant nothing to him although he was flying some moral kites on his own account Do whatever you like I m out of it Waldbridge rose to his feet What do you mean You can take my father s name down If you liquidate the business now it will mean disaster I have no interest in it I am leaving New York Then Waldbridge broke down It was terrible a long established respected firm wreckage pure wreckage that word seemed to have a fatal significance in Martin s life Can I count on say ten thousand a year for ten years Julie was luxuriously inclined because her heart had been empty He would take her away from cities they would live somewhere quietly in the country Waldbridge smiled You can always have that and more if you want it Then Martin did a wonderful thing so wonderful it left Waldbridge speechless staring at him Was the man mad There was a taint of insanity in the family Martin read his thoughts I m thirty two years old and I know what I am doing I want you to turn this business into a company every man in it from the lowest to the highest must have his share You of course will be the head of the firm Get a good lawyer and do it legally You ll have your work every mother s son of you to get the old hulk out of the mud if you do you re entitled to the spoils And the capital gasped Waldbridge I told you what I want the rest I ll leave in business you can t go on without it can you No Then what s the use of talking about it He held out his hand Waldbridge grasped it trying to stammer out his gratitude but Martin was gone He dashed out of the place threw himself into a taxi Uptown The New York chauffeur is accustomed to indefinite addresses He looked back at the man with his hat pulled over his eyes crouching in a corner A bloke who had lost his wad Then he wondered if it was a defaulter or a gunman some of them looked like perfect gentlemen He drove uptown entered the Park There he stopped He was hungry that guy in the corner could sleep all day Where to Martin pitched forward by the sudden jolt glared at him The Waldorf He sprang up the stairs three at a time too nervous to wait for the elevator looked around the room which was in disorder his man couldn t keep it tidy Martin flung everything about He would take nothing with him but a dress suit case He caught sight in the corner of an old box covered with deerskin tied together with a thick rope he had taken it from the garret after his grandfather s death but had never opened it He untwisted the knots one after the other It was a hard job It hurt his fingers He took out a pair of mountain boots goat s leather with large nails in the soles Martin looked down at his feet they would fit him He pulled out an old woollen shirt a pair of corduroy trousers a felt hat with a green feather a bright colored vest and red handkerchiefs There was a small chamois bag with strange coins Swiss money Martin examined them curiously a pack of old letters a photograph of a young boy and girl a cow and a high mountain at the back That mountain fascinated him he looked at it long intensely The raw boy and girl in Swiss dress were his grandparents Martin thought of his mother On the back of the card there was something printed which he made out with difficulty Val Sinestra He had never heard the name He put everything back in the trunk and roped it the idea came suddenly he would take it with him to Switzerland After Julie left Floyd spent his evenings at the club there were many strange to him The membership had increased it was still a mark of class to be seen lounging at the club window in the afternoon He missed Martin He was different from the others When he raved against the world he said things in bad taste but often the bitter truth With a sudden impulse he wrote a few lines asking him to lunch at the club the following day He d be furious when he heard Julie had sailed He d say You might have given me a chance to send her a few flowers Floyd smiled yes he liked Martin more than that he loved him he was interwoven with the memories of his childhood his youth He wished that episode had not happened when Julie was ill but she was unconscious of it She had never in all that time mentioned his name It was all in his own evil mind He mentally asked pardon of Martin The next morning at breakfast he had a feeling of agreeable expectancy The boy was crying upstairs Bridget couldn t quiet him What s the matter up there The child fretted for his mother He had caught a cold and had been kept in the house for some days He was standing with his boat in his hands sobbing piteously Floyd pacified him by running the water into the bath which was sunken in the center of a tiled room The boy handed his father the boat Floyd turned it over in his hand A costly toy Mamma is good to you Mamma didn t give it to me Yes she did Mamma gives you everything She didn t insisted the boy My Uncle Martin bought it for me Your Uncle Martin Yes He came every day to the Park and then he put a note in the cabin telling Mamma to come and she came Where is the cabin You can t find it nobody but me The boy in great glee pressed the spring There s no letter there Oh no I gave it to Mamma she read it and tore it up Floyd pushed the boy away He was making a spy of his innocent child Why didn t Julie tell him Did Mamma meet Uncle Martin in the Park every day No not every day she d stay away sometimes because Uncle Martin scolded her and she d cry He loved me and petted me and said he was going to steal me away But you wouldn t leave me would you Joseph The boy meditated and then told the truth Perhaps I would Papa if Mamma came along but I don t think she d come because Uncle Martin scolded her too much I was mad at him and said Uncle Martin you ll have to beg Mother s pardon I always do when I m bad Then Uncle Martin laughed and gave me such a long kiss and said There take that to Mamma and it will be all right Floyd sat motionless with the boy in his arms The little fellow s eyes drooped he slid down pillowed his head on the big fur animal those glassy eyes brought Floyd back to Mrs Gonzola why did she always watch Julie He had never asked any questions about the unexpected call on the telephone He had been deliriously happy there was no room in his thoughts for the past He bent over the child noting the beautiful powerful body neither he nor Julie had great physical strength The boy would be a giant Why did Mrs Gonzola press such a quick marriage Why did she keep him away so much during their short engagement Why did she want Julie to get used to the idea As a child Julie liked Martin better they d disappear and he d wander about looking for them then go home disappointed In his mad desire to get her he had really done Martin an injustice he should have waited He didn t do the square thing because he knew Martin would have won out He bent lower over the boy trying to find some clue in that innocent face The blood rushed to his head he must have it out with Martin he couldn t go on with evil suspicions of his wife his friend Martin was no liar He always told the brutal truth even if it were against himself The night brought sanity consolation Julie was foolish but not criminal Her religion wouldn t let her do anything wrong She went to Confession the day before her marriage then he wondered what did she really believe She was by creed a Catholic but she taught her boy his prayers in Hebrew He went early to the club and waited for Martin who was late as usual He looked at his watch and idly took up the morning paper His eye caught a headline The Aquitania sailing with a distinguished crowd on board What the ship already back and sailing again It was the usual summer rush he knew most of the names One riveted his gaze He read it once twice three times the paper dropped from his hand He saw that name wherever he looked Martin Steele had sailed on the Aquitania It was ten days before the next steamer crowded with pleasure seekers sailed for England At the last moment Floyd came on board too late to have his name in the passenger list The only cabin left was on the lowest deck inside He went down locked the door unpacked his valise Most of its space was taken up by a silver mounted leather box one would say an elegant toilette case He opened it took out a brace of shining pistols examined each one carefully and put it back in the box He had no definite plan but when a man catches a thief in his house he shoots him Martin arrived in London and put up at the Savoy he noticed the crowds of fine young fellows and beautifully dressed women Is there anything unusual going on tonight Yes said the polite young clerk a dinner and dance in honor of Mrs Garrison an American lady Julie had been received by the Ambassador in London with great cordiality on account of his old friendship for Jimmie Garrison Mary wrote to Mr Garrison You have all reason to be well satisfied with your wife We have done the right thing She is enjoying herself She looks like a young girl the element which disturbed her has disappeared I find her so much more normal The letter never reached Floyd Martin stood in the doorway his eyes fixed on Julie who was surrounded by eager applicants waiting their turn to dance with the silver haired beauty He took in the soft white neck the dimpled arms the small classic head and that something in the curve of her mouth and yielding smile a triumphant sensuality She swept past him He could have touched her he stood motionless Mary was up early the next morning She stood looking at Julie in a deep sleep her hair falling loose enveloping her in a veil of unreality then she shut the door softly and went into the salon Waiting for her simple breakfast she watched the passing busses and pedestrians in the street below All large cities are the same but different like people each individuality giving another form to the Image or material symbol London has a distinct personality nobility of character is unmistakably stamped upon it The door opened she turned and saw Martin There was a momentary fear then she was her quiet self again Martin apologized for startling her They measured each other he saw an enemy Why are you so antagonistic to me I m never antagonistic without reason What reason have I given you She looked keenly at him He was well groomed a clean shaven intense face fascinating for some women he repelled Mary He has courage to show his mouth she thought I have been sent here by Mrs Garrison s doctor she has had a serious illness you know that Yes She may at any time fall back into the same condition I don t want her to know you are here Why There was a gleam of humor in his eyes it angered her Why should she play policy with him Because your presence may excite her You are Mr Garrison s friend I hope you will take my advice and not try to see her until she has finished her cure What cure She has been sent to a place in Switzerland called Val Sinestra to drink arsenic water you see I am keeping nothing from you Very kind I could easily find out Val Sinestra The name was familiar She stood with her hand on the door knob waiting for him to go Val Sinestra I will write her I have orders to withhold any communications which may excite her Orders from her husband No from her doctor Her eyes shot fire at him He went back to his room took out of his bag the bundle of old letters Yes that was the name Val Sinestra it was Destiny There were two sides to Martin a fiercely brutal realism and a mysticism instinctively concealed As a boy he would lie night after night his eyes wide open visions came and faded It was always the same struggle with an unseen horror He would awaken from a restless sleep his face damp with tears Those days he was very silent his stepmother called them his sullen fits As he grew older the visions vanished but he had hours of deep abstraction when reality slipped away from him He sat in his room the banal colored post card of the two young peasants in his hand There was a sudden consciousness of Liberation the other self flew out and away through walls over seas over mountain peaks soaring soaring He sat there for hours motionless That evening the hotel clerk handed Miss Mary a note It contained one line scrawled on half a sheet of paper Am leaving for Paris She was very glad she wondered how far it had gone between those two The responsibility was heavy At thirty two Martin put his foot for the first time upon the soil of his ancestors He roamed through Zurich mounted its narrow cobble stoned alley ways stood before an overhanging house reading the inscription This house is three hundred years old The lives of Zwingli Pestalozzi became familiar He read ravenously the history of the town He stood on the border of its blue lake encircled with snow mountains A Turquoise on a white bosom Something stirred in him an inward convulsion like the sudden eruption of an extinct crater he broke into choking tearless sobs Martin unknown to himself had the Swiss temperament a people without the gift of self expression a deeply religious peasant race silent before the mystic beauty of their mountains Patriotism that misunderstood word with its medieval clashing of swords its uniforms its medals has no relation to the Swiss adoration of the soil He worships his valleys his lakes his waterfalls they are living to him he has a rage for the mountains he leaves his country to seek wealth but he rarely stays in the stranger s land nostalgia drives him home he must get back to the heights or die Martin understood later why his grandfather went mad why his father was wordless why his mother died young He tried his Swiss on the portier of the Bauer au lac Hotel a man of all round information a veritable encyclop dia of Switzerland who could answer in the many languages of the cosmopolitan crowd on its way to and from the mountains Martin spoke a few words to him in his grandfather s lingo then said What am I speaking anyhow Your dialect is Romontsch or Romance Your people came from the Grisons Then he explained how in the Middle Ages the Barons and Bishops had oppressed the people and how they formed Leagues and fought for their freedom The Grisons took their name from the Gray League a heroic band of peasants Martin left Zurich by the early train the next morning he sat the entire day gazing out of the window unconscious of the other passengers A great moving picture shot before him green valleys velvet hills beautiful grazing animals brooks changing into waterfalls cataracts dashing down dark ravines mountains growing higher higher At Tarasp he stayed over night to connect with the stage coach at daybreak and spent the evening sitting outside with the guides who told him of the Val Sinestra where the bandits used to live in caves deep down in the ravines and smuggled wine over the border Then they spoke in lowered tones of the danger of mountain climbing of death of miracles they had seen above in the mist with their own eyes With the rising of the sun seated beside the coach driver Martin pierced the mountain passes they stopped at a quaint hamlet We turn here said the old man Then he wished Godspeed cracked his whip and went on The coach pitched from side to side on a perilously narrow road but the horses were sure footed and the driver past seventy had gone the same way for fifty years Martin drew deep breaths of the fragrant air he looked about him The houses were a mixture of old Swiss and Italian architecture the protruding windows and little balconies were covered with bright flowers in the distance he caught sight of a picturesque church and cemetery He entered an inn with a swinging sign a rooster flapping its wings The spotless floors sprinkled with sand the small counter with shelves of bottles the peasant girl in the costume of the Canton it was all so familiar She brought him a glass of wine and a pretzel smiling at his jargon He remarked on the absence of men They are up there with the cows for the summer She pointed to the green hills gradually becoming steeper In those little huts on the top they make the cheese which they send all over the world In the winter the sun doesn t come up very high it is like a blue twilight here The storms howl the snow falls for weeks When the peasant closes his eyes the avalanche haunts him if he awakens in the morning he is grateful to God The girl went on chattering in her soft Romance The doctor goes down to Croire in the winter but our pastor stays with us We have service here when the snow is too deep to walk to the chapel Then she put down the glass she was polishing and went joyously to the door to meet a tall man a gigantic peasant with masses of thick gray hair falling to his shoulder He was long past seventy but showed no signs of age His voice rang out stentorian clear He was warm wiping the perspiration from his face with a large red handkerchief He looked at Martin with keen penetrating eyes Then said Good morning Oh you speak English Yes we have many English visitors Our children are taught it in the schools He looked again seemingly puzzled What is your name Martin Steele My people come from over here Steele He shook his head I know none of that name Martin took from his pocket the bundle of old letters One glance at them and the pastor s arms were around him I wrote those letters to your grandfather I am his brother You are not an American you are a Swiss Your name is not Steele it is Staehli Martin Staehli The eldest of our family for generations back was always Martin Martin felt a throb of joy the blood of this fine old man with the head of a Roman ran in his veins He had known only Aunt Priscilla whom he wanted to burn Come I am going to take you home with me Martin looked back at the Swiss Madel In her red skirt and velvet bodice an image of national womanhood They walked together down the hill through the fields past the little chapel and cemetery where they stopped On the headstones he read again and again the name Martin Staehli He would bring his grandfather his parents and lay them where they belonged and he would lie there beside them The pastor looked up at the great mountain already casting a shadow over the valley even in summer the day was short The night came early and lingered We are not all here My son was the best guide in the Canton He was lost in a snow drift up there At the ch let with its black beams centuries old still strong unyielding he put his hand over Martin s head and blessed his entrance into the home of his fathers Martin stood in the long hall vaguely conscious of atmosphere A cuckoo sprang out of an old clock chanting the hour a spinning wheel with threaded flax new linen piled up a living thing that wheel it clothed the people Carved chests plaques of fruit birds cut out by the natives when the country was Italian everything in the room bearing witness a living story teller of the lives and times of the vanished family For the first time he felt the antique He was swayed by a kind of psychic storm like a rush of wind through the pass of a mountain The pastor at the door called Angela Angela A clear voice answered she came down the path a girl of sixteen with bits of hay in her flaxen hair a child like look of wonder in her blue eyes and something more of mystery Martin thought of Joan of Arc in the orchard On seeing Martin she gave a quick impulsive cry The pastor put his arm around her What frightens you Angela It is my brother Martin s son from America Angela extended her hand but her warm radiance had vanished Come out in the sun it is cold here She brought mugs of thick yellow milk brown bread delicious chipped beef then went again into the field and sat sorting out leaves from a basket The pastor followed Martin s gaze which lingered on the girl she appealed to his artistic sense Angela is a wonder child she is not of our family I found her one moonlit winter night in a snow drift a white angel Since she came the village has prospered the people are happy Martin smiled probably the child of some unfortunate village girl The pastor read his thoughts She belongs to no one she is a miracle child You don t believe in miracles No Then why are you here A simple question difficult to answer He couldn t express the longing which from childhood had made him restless unhappy a longing for some other space some other element He couldn t explain his agitation his unbearable joy when he saw those scenes of which his grandfather had babbled in incoherent broken bits He answered conventionally I wanted to see the place where my grandfather was born The pastor grew very serious It was not a case of idle curiosity you were drawn here Angela knew you were coming I used to tell her stories of your grandfather Martin Staehli He was queer had a streak in him of evil He got into a brawl with a guide and killed him he had to leave the country I never knew that said Martin That s why he changed his name I wrote to him often but he seldom answered Poor Martin he got very rich Martin laughed bitterly That almost uncontrollable instinct to destroy was his inheritance Angela said the third generation would return home She has the gift of prophecy and of healing She cures the people of their ills The cattle run to her for her herbs there is a magic in them She brews them with Prayer with Love Martin shook off a peculiar feeling it was all superstitious nonsense an insult to a man s intelligence He rose to go You will stay here with us I m sorry but I must meet some friends Where is the Val Sinestra Hotel A little distance from here on the other side of the hill beyond the hay field Martin looked up at the straight stony walls of the big mountain I m going to climb that mountain he said The pastor smiled Perhaps when you have had long practice a man must train himself to climb The pastor watched him as he went with quick uneven steps stumbling here and there he had no equilibrium He d never climb that mountain Angela was also watching Martin The pastor put his hand on her shoulder she started He terrifies me I am afraid of him She threw herself sobbing into the old man s arms The pale women were coming up from the Springs where they drank the arsenic water with a prayer for red corpuscles strength beauty The Spring of Youth was in a cleft in the mountain a dark mysterious fountain of gushing water unlit by the sun Martin paced his room in the hotel She was there arrived two weeks before the cure was nearly over The madness came back now he had been free of it for a few hours It was like the relapse of a fever violent vicious raging He had waited too long for her with stupid patience and more stupid scruples He heard Julie s voice downstairs he went to the window She was standing on the terrace talking to Miss Mary who was leaving She kissed Julie jumped into the hotel omnibus and drove off Julie stood a moment waving her hand then turned and entered the house He heard her voice outside in the corridor speaking to the maid The next door opened her room adjoined his The Sun God sinking slowly behind the mountain scattered an orgy of color Julie stepped out on her balcony There was a low railing between them He jumped over Julie She started with sudden fear fled into the room He followed tried to say something stood speechless looking at her She was wonderful The force of the rich blood surging under the white skin swept him like a cyclone There was a new intensity of life in her quick flashes of passion in her eyes She gave a low cry threw her arms out trembling with uncontrollable joy You You She kissed him again and again How she kissed him then drew him outside Come come The sun is setting it was too wonderful I couldn t bear it alone His eyes held hers I saw Miss Mary driving away Yes she has gone to Tarasp to visit an old patient she will be away until tomorrow afternoon A shadow fell it was twilight You must go now He tried to hold her she slipped out of his arms shutting the long windows after her He went back to his room Those fleeting moments made him eager desperate The night was coming on they were alone together at the end of the world Miss Mary sitting in the train was troubled She opened a telegram and read it again Meet me at Tarasp Say nothing to my wife Floyd Garrison The little parlor of the hotel was filled with guests assembled there as was the custom waiting for the dining room doors to be opened Martin standing in the hall a living symbol of electric force created a sensation He drew nearer and took in the crowd of pale women young nervous with mysterious ills they could not or would not explain to their doctor who for the lack of a suitable name called the sickness an mia He looked them over with an experienced man s compelling eyes Some were very good looking would have been beautiful under favorable conditions but they were pale with white lips and drawn features like plants in a dark cellar pining for the sun He became amusedly conscious of being the only man he finally espied in the garden a rheumatic old fellow like the decayed trunk of a tree He felt a battery of admiring glances leveled at him He smiled went to the foot of the staircase waited for Julie They went in to dinner together The table in a deep window at the far end of the room was decorated tonight with an abundance of flowers Martin played with his food he was too excited to eat but he was in wonderful spirits Julie had never seen him like that she had a feeling of triumphant elation He was handsome the other women were envying her He laughingly remarked about the Eden with one Adam and many temptresses They are all so white as if frozen in ice the Sun God should come and melt them He squeezed her hand under the table I am sorry for the good women They sacrifice themselves for an illusion chastity She answered quickly The woman doesn t think so It is her religion It may mean nothing to you but for her it is a spiritual compensation Oh that s Catholic laughed Martin She shivered drew her cape around her Then he said Look how beautiful The twilight is wonderful up here light mixing with darkness like two souls How the valley stretches out Do you hear the rushing of waters They are saying Give me your body I will heal you Look The mountain has a halo of red it catches at my throat and chokes me He was poetic inspired He raised his glass The wine goes through my veins like warm blood If I were a doctor I d prescribe it for the ladies Oh oh laughed Julie forbidden fruit And you There was a laughing question in his eyes I m cured She drained the glass After dinner they walked up and down the terrace in front of the hotel like old friends who had not met for some time and had much to say to each other Gradually the buzzing inside subsided the pale creatures evaporated lights were put out one glimmered in each corridor He drew Julie into a small summer house covered with vines at the end of the garden The head waitress brought in wine He thanked her the Swiss know the hotel business He slipped his arm under Julie s cape She resisted but he held her close She could hear his heart beating violently Then it seemed as if it stood quite still but it commenced soon to hammer again against hers I must go in she whispered They close the house early She put her arms around his neck raised her face to his How dark it is Yes It s always so before the moon comes up Then she slipped away He caught her back Will you give me a signal It was a moment of suspense Yes He looked up at her room there was a candle burning in the window When you put out that light I ll come He reluctantly let her go She went up the stairs he saw her at her window There was a white spirit also watching the moon that Orb d Maiden chaste as the sleeping women within Only those two were living with them it was Flood Tide The light in Julie s window went out It was dark now the moon ashamed had turned away her face He started to go his feet were lead his body weighed them down What ailed him He shook himself like an angry beast Martin don t go The voice was low but very clear did it come from without or within He didn t know Martin don t commit this crime don t rob your friend If you love the woman do not destroy her it is one throb more one desire fulfilled and then the Price At daybreak the gardener crawling about found the stranger in the summer house his head on the table buried in his arms He looked at the empty bottles The wine of the Canton was strong he shook the sleeping man once twice Martin started up where was he The hotel was empty The guests were at the Springs A bath of mineral effervescent water refreshed him but that strange feeling came again like a dream which returns in fitful flashes fragments of color impossible to blend He paced the room his eyes fell upon the deerskin trunk he had brought with him He opened it took out the corduroy trousers boots shirt examined them critically His valet had pronounced them only fit for the ash can but that didn t influence Martin He had them cleaned folded and put back into the box He drew on the soft leather boots they fitted him The woollen shirt was light and warm Looking at himself in the glass he saw a man of the mountains real living If a man buys a costume like that it is only a masquerade this was his inheritance The omnibus came back from the Springs he went down and helped Julie out seeking in her face the reproach he deserved She smiled at him how sweet of her The fact was when Julie reached her room the usual revulsion of feeling set in She undressed quickly dropping her clothing in a heap on the floor blew out the candle There was a dark form below waiting she stood breathless her hand on the knob of the door Then she turned the key crept to the window pushed the bolt She was securely locked in she slipped into bed This morning she looked very girlish in a sport suit the short skirt grazing the tops of very high tan leather boots A soft hat pulled down over one eye gave her rosy face a touch of diablerie She was all animation joking about his Alpine costume casting roguish glances at him but he felt the undercurrent of emotion He adored her We are going out for a day in the woods You don t ask will I go No but you will won t you There was pathos in his voice longing she couldn t resist him Yes but I must rest after the bath and dress lightly The morning here is cold at noon it gets very warm He bent down and whispered Wear white like a bride During the interval of waiting Martin studied a map of the Canton tracing lines from one Dorf to another short walking tours through the woods there were plenty of little inns where they could rest He paced the terrace impatiently She came all in white A filmy scarf wound around her head la turque accentuated the Oriental in her She laughingly drew the long floating streamers across her face her eyes shot fire through their soft transparency A little wagon drove up the peasant boy cracked his whip and they started off The road was smooth sunlit They stopped at the Springs where Julie made him drink the unsavory water to clear his complexion They were in high spirits laughing at simple things like two children When they reached the chasm the road became steep narrow with dark overhanging trees Martin drew Julie close to him a mysterious something hovered about them intangible in its beauty penetrating wonderful The driveway ended there The descent into the ravine must be finished on foot The lad took a basket from the wagon and set it on the ground then he cracked his whip and drove off At the Savoy Floyd heard many flattering things about his beautiful wife He was silent kept turning over the pages of the hotel register finally found the name he was looking for Martin Steele New York Then he wired Miss Mary and left at once for Switzerland made quick connections arriving at Tarasp toward evening The stage coach from Val Sinestra was expected He paced up and down before the hotel his thoughts stinging like a swarm of bees He had married well he was a happy man in the world s vocabulary Happy A man who marries Beauty lives on a powder mine The something which compels adoration makes a woman unfit for matrimony A man can t always be on his knees that s very well at night but he becomes a ridiculous figure in the daylight The coach shambled up the road Mary was the only passenger she nodded and smiled at him He helped her out Were you surprised to get my telegram Yes You understood Mary waited She wasn t sure how much he knew He spoke again excitedly Why did Dr McClaren send my wife to Europe without me Mrs Garrison wanted it there was no peace for her with that man so near He was watching her keenly Did he think she was in collusion with his wife against him Her face burned she looked straight at him Mr Garrison it was an experiment and very successful She is cured He was ashamed She and the doctor knew his dishonor and then the world His voice was hot angry He followed her to London they were together at the Savoy No He was there Then she told him of her encounter with Martin and how he went away without seeing Julie He had done them a terrible injustice He was piteously grateful held her hands made a foolish attempt to kiss them She grew very pale and said Oh Mr Garrison He dropped them very much embarrassed looked at his watch It was already ten o clock the evening had passed quickly in spite of his misery You are tired I have been inconsiderate Oh no but if you don t mind I ll go to my room now He stood at the foot of the stairs looking after her she smiled back at him She was glad she had been able to bring him a hopeful message They started off the next morning in a comfortable open carriage Mary told him funny stories about the blood poor women and their arsenic intoxication showed him pretty twists in the splendid road built by the Romans They stopped at a little inn for a bite of cheese and a glass of beer He planned a trip to Lugano and over the lake to Italy he was in good spirits the sense of relief acted like a strong stimulant Mary was very loyal to Julie Mr Garrison I can assure you everything is all right I have written to Rome at Mrs Garrison s request After her cure she has plans to go with you to visit Father Cabello Floyd was very penitent I am glad to know that Father Cabello has a strong influence over my wife She has been too worldly I hope he will bring her back to religion On arriving at the hotel Mary went at once to Julie s room it was in great disorder everything scattered about as if she had dressed very hurriedly Floyd downstairs was questioning the woman manager Madame had gone with Monsieur Steele they had taken luncheon with them Did Madame expect Monsieur Garrison No I wanted to surprise her Do you know where they went Yes The boy who drove them is here I would like to find them if possible The woman went to order the wagon Mary was pale agitated Mr Garrison when I left your wife Mr Steele was not here He didn t answer he frightened her What are you going to do Find her and bring her back A storm is brewing said the woman They come up quickly and are terrible while they last The wagon drove up he jumped in Mary stood watching him till he was out of sight The clouds gathered the wind slunk into its den Floyd pushed back his hat wiped the perspiration from his forehead it was stifling The lovers stood together on a grassy plateau the sun poured bright beams of light below was a dense mist How wonderful said Martin Nature has kept a sunny spot for us we ll stay here awhile He drew his lodin cape around him stretched himself out on the grass looking up at the golden clouds surrounding the sun looking below at the rapidly rising veil of gray it was glorious Julie took bread fowl wine out of the basket they ate with their fingers and drank the wine out of the bottle The sun glimmered red through the dark clouds They were silent then he spoke quietly at first becoming gradually very much excited Why did you throw me over so heartlessly after you promised me to prepare your mother I knew it was useless I had made all my arrangements I had a cabin engaged on a French steamer Julie tried to justify herself then began to cry hysterically she had never broken faith with him He couldn t imagine what she d been through all her life The pressure of those two terrible religions her grandfather dragging her one way her mother threatening her with eternal punishment He tried to soothe her Don t cry Julie I ll make it up to you You will be happy for the first time in your life But Floyd he s been so good you always came between us pushing him away She slipped out of his arms It was Floyd now coming between them it wasn t so easy to push him away They had been friends so long Floyd was the innocent victim Martin s eyes roved restlessly and that gray mist rising rising She waited for him to speak then she went to him like a child piteous pathetic Martin don t be angry with me I love you but the winter here is cold the snow is like a winding sheet I couldn t bear it She was wavering again it brought him back fiery impatient We will go to Lugano Italy Spain you will get your divorce I will marry you No No there is no divorce in the Church I am afraid of Father Cabello Those fear thoughts how they tore at her He took her in his arms kissed her until the color came back to her face the warmth to her body She was his absolutely he could make her do what he wanted but he mustn t leave her Then she gave a sudden cry It was like an animal in pain What now What now My boy You won t let them take him away you must promise me that Julie look at me She raised her heavy lids and met his searching glance their souls questioned mutely answered mutely He drew her closer You shall have your boy I promise you Are you satisfied now Yes She was tired beaten to exhaustion by the force of rushing psychic waves breaking against her weak will Her head throbbed she tore off her scarf her hair dropped in a thick coil down her back like a writhing white snake he wound it around his neck This was my punishment No No Our love was not a crime You fought too hard against it Nature put her hand on your head and turned your hair white it was her revenge Julie listened fascinated he was irresistible like that his voice vibrating Every nerve in her body responded He stroked her forehead softly the pain ceased How happy she was how happy You are a woman of the Orient you are starving for love it is your life you cannot fight it it is too strong for you for me come come These children of passion went down into the mist He carried her along in his strong embrace lifting her over the stones her feet scarcely touching the ground there was a wonderful sense of lightness as if she had thrown off a heavy load The fog was cold it dampened her face her hair They reached the bottom of the ravine the clouds around them moved disclosing a little wooden house which had been hidden in the mist Now it stood out clearly a bit of beautiful old architecture Julie shrank away It is a chapel see over the door the cross Take me home take me home He laughed mockingly Nonsense you must get over your religious superstition The chapel will shelter us from the storm Come let us go in No No not there She fled he followed her the mist dropped like a curtain between them growing thicker thicker Julie where are you He heard her voice close to him Here He took her in his arms wrapped his cape about her she clung to him He was deliriously happy he held her in a frenzy of possession Julie my love my love The mist rose slowly the red rays of the setting sun penetrated into the ravine they were enveloped in flames He could see her face now distinctly as she lay in his arms The mist vanished like magic and there there he saw no no it couldn t be Floyd s voice rang out through the pass struck the mountainside and came back Julie Martin held her with a fierce joy He would stand now in the open for what he was Julie was crying pitifully He was very tender He soothed her like a child Hush Hush It is better there will be no more lies Floyd s first impulse was to drag her from Martin s arms but he stood motionless listening to her sobs Then she tore herself away with an appealing cry Floyd Forgive me Forgive me That set both the men on fire Martin gave an angry growl Again Floyd s voice rang out Julie you are my wife You must come with me A moment s silence the trees motionless the clouds sullen waiting then the voice of Nature so long suppressed broke out in Julie No No I belong to Martin I will not leave him I cannot Martin stood a little above her he put out his hand to draw her up she smiled at him God her joy Floyd raised his pistol fired Martin s arm fell to his side Now burning with a murderous rage he sprang forward at closer range This time through the heart With a cry of horror Julie wrested the pistol from his hand It fell some distance away went off reverberating through the valley arousing the people The pastor heard it in the little chapel where he had gone at the approach of the storm He came holding up his lantern seeking the cause A fierce gust of wind blew through the ravine whirling in a dervish like dance of fiendish fury Then the demon in Martin went out to meet the tearing forces of nature Fool Fool You cannot hold her She was never yours never She is mine by Nature s unalterable law Floyd s agonized tones rose above the wind Julie Julie I want to save you from a terrible fate look at him Can t you see He is mad mad That word struck Martin a fatal blow He put his hand to his head there was a look in his eyes like a stricken beast pleading for mercy Floyd never forgot it No No not that He turned and fled stumbling over rocks through bushes a terrible horror pursuing him stretching out its giant claws to entangle him Mad Yes he was mad It was his inheritance The storm raged crashes of thunder flashes of lightning an enormous tree sprang into the air its great quivering limbs cleft in twain The pines wailed muttered waved their long arms he staggered on fighting the elements without within He was conscious of climbing his strength grew fear made him superhuman He heard a voice behind him calling Mad Mad He went on crashing through obstacles going up up there was no measurement of time of distance He stood on the first peak of the great mountain It rose before him a straight wall of stone a deep chasm yawned between He threw out his arms with agonizing longing Up there Up to the top There was no trace of mist The air was cold the sky studded with brilliant planets their light searched his soul He saw clearly the jungle within him the tearing beasts of passion the wreckage the futility the dark future He raised his head to that glory once more then with a cry of despair he went over the precipice The pastor followed Martin to the foot of the mountain He could go no further the ground was slippery dangerous He retraced his steps with a heavy heart He was filled with righteous anger One of his name had dishonored a woman he must make restitution He found Julie in a frenzy of fear calling again and again Martin Martin She stood like a white spirit erect in the storm The lightning rent the clouds then the floods came down They carried her to the shelter of the chapel The little building centuries old was originally a storehouse for contraband a refuge for bandits who hid themselves from the gendarmes among the wine barrels in the caves beneath When the Church took it they brought a beautiful altar from Italy and artists who painted religious figures on the walls The wine caves were partitioned into cells where pious monks prayed and rubbed their rheumatic limbs Finally this holy place a victim of skeptical times was used as a theatre where allegorical plays dealing with the political and religious history of the country were performed When Julie became conscious of the dimly lit altar with its faded velvet and gold lace its figure of the Virgin in painted wood she stood transfixed she saw herself on the day of her confirmation her mother putting around her neck a gold chain and cross she heard her own voice repeating the Confession of Faith the organ pealing the Hymn of Praise the lights the Presence With a cry of anguish she fell on her knees Holy Mary Mother of God have pity Then a deep tender voice filled the chapel the voice of Father Cabello Father Cabello was a mystic Brought up within the walls of a monastery dedicated to Heaven from his birth he saw the will of God in every event of his kaleidoscopic existence He had travelled much studied much with the one ever dominating ambition which slowly but inevitably came to its fulfillment The Gonzola family with money and influence had in those two generations been a great Catholic influence in America Father Cabello was the power behind it He had sustained Mrs Gonzola that devout pious woman in her awful struggles with Joseph Abravanel He loved Julie held himself responsible for her soul He would save her as he had saved her mother He had been ill in Rome stricken down with fever caught in the unsanitary quarters trying to improve the deplorable condition of the people he went down under a hopeless task Many a night seated at his luxurious table with its rich appointments its costly wines a terrible thought would come again and again Was the poverty of its children a curse laid upon the Holy City for the generations of intolerance its auto da f its crusades He tried to drive those haunting spirits away he was not the Judge only an insignificant part of an indestructible Institution a symbol the moulded image of an Iron Will Delirium consumed him He was for weeks near death then came very slowly back to life Lying on his flowered terrace the great panorama of Rome before him he thought of Julie She had written to him often after he left America but her letters grew less frequent Before his sickness he had received a short note from Mary telling of Julie s second collapse and her trip to Switzerland the arsenic waters at the Val Sinestra had helped her wonderfully the cure would end July twenty second There was apparently nothing to cause uneasiness in the letter Father Cabello was ostensibly of Jesuit origin but he possessed a much older secret inheritance from the time when his ancestors were noble Spanish Maranos deeply versed in deception and the Talmud He scented the trail of disaster Why had not Julie written to him herself Why had she travelled to Europe without her husband her child Why Why The doctors advised him to go on a visit to America where the climate would drive the malaria out of his system He refused his strength was not equal to so long a journey Then they advised Disentis in Switzerland one of the few strong holds left to the Church He was haunted with the thought of Julie He would go to the Val Sinestra and see for himself Disentis its crumbling piles of stone monasteries of the seventh century its stillness its health giving air the wonderful healing waters gushing from the earth into natural rock basins hollowed out by Nature s hand the frugal fare the rising at the first glimpse of dawn the pervading sweetness of the bells prayer which had a new sanctity as if nearer the Divine Fount there he gained new spiritual inspiration new physical strength there during the summer months the Benedictine Friars welcome their brothers from all corners of the world Father Cabello clasped hands with monks of many orders The Trappists appealed strongly to his affection bare footed humble rich in knowledge he never tired listening to their many colored experiences He was eagerly questioned about America the land of unbounded possibilities He had a store of humorous stories which were greeted with low chuckles and spasmodic movements of the diaphragm Walking with the Father Superior one day in the surrounding woods that benign forest which protects the children of God from the avalanche Father Cabello asked about Val Sinestra and how he could get there Easily from here my carriage is at your disposal a drive at leisure through the mountains a most beautiful and interesting trip Near the Val Sinestra there is an ancient bit of architecture a deserted chapel it is now the property of a poor community headed by a great man Pastor Staehli the Church should buy it back I will see to it said Father Cabello The next day he started out there was no trace of anger in the blue sky but the driver pointed to a small watery cloud low on the horizon We are going to have a storm would it not be better to wait until it is over said the Superior Father Cabello hesitated then he answered I want to be at Val Sinestra before the twenty second I am being pushed by a strong impulse which has some mysterious significance a call for help from one I love Then go in God s name That drive through the mountains was a sacrament Father Cabello bowed before a great God clothed in a sacerdotal vestment of Nature There is the chapel said the driver It was distinctly visible in the valley below Suddenly a shot rang out What was that The driver shook his head It seemed to the excited imagination of the priest like a discharge signalling a great battle then the fury of the Invisible broke the man whipped up his horses and dashed down the incline toward the chapel It is wonderful in the mountains after such an outbreak of electric force the Prince of Light marches majestically in the Heavens showering gifts of prismatic gold a Master Chemist he will create again from the storm wreckage the stricken trees will sink into the bosom of the earth and moulder there generating in Nature s crucible new germs of Life and the little dark pine children will be born Floyd paced restlessly outside the chapel listening to Julie s sobs and the voice of the priest tender persuasive stern threatening Once before he had pleaded with Joseph Abravanel now a second time he is pleading with his wife His wife No No Lies Lies She was never his she belonged to Martin by the unalterable law of Nature They would go on saying that He would always see them with their arms around each other He had been cheated cheated A sharp bolt of light pierced the dark valley shone on the battered cross above the chapel glanced off lit up the silver trimmings of the pistol on the ground He picked it up The voices in the chapel rose and fell You must go back to your husband I will not I belong to Martin I will never leave him I cannot Her voice was sharp with agony Floyd shuddered why should she be tortured like that Why If he were dead they could live He was dead burnt to cinders The tongues of flame in his father s workshop had crept into his body consumed it there was nothing left but the shell easy enough to put an end to that clay image Shoot its head off The pastor wrested the pistol from the hand of the distraught man led him through a trail to the ch let and left him with Angela He was quiet now he lay back in a chair with closed eyes She sat and watched him passing her cool hand over his hot forehead the lamp shed a soft glow over the pale face the well shaped head the regular features A splendid human species those Americans a youthful race a type ennobled by climate good food and labor that develops character She thought of the cretins of her own beautiful land of the degenerating races of Europe This man was like Dresden china fine very fine but there were deep lines that made the face look old the chisel of Life had cut deeply into him She bent over him Come with me He looked blankly into her soft radiant eyes Who was she She took him up the narrow stairs into a small room with bare white walls a little cot a bunch of Alpine roses on a table by the window Will you try to sleep No No She led him to the balcony a nest under the overhanging roof Sit here you will sleep She put him in a reclining chair and left him The moon shone on his flushed face the valley was filled with soft shadows the mountain raised a luminous head The air penetrated his agonized body An hour passed a white figure stood beside him Come in The night air in the mountains is too strong for strangers He saw her through a mist his eyes dim with overpowering sleep He fell on the cot she covered him with a warm blanket The pastor called the guides together they came with their ropes and axes He spoke tersely they were used to action not words A man had gone up the mountain in the storm Then he gave a low whistle There was a panting a breaking through the bushes A dog threw himself upon the pastor who bent over him stroking his thick coat with a magnetic touch He gave him Martin s mantle the dog tore at it dropped it The pastor whispered Find him With a low whine the animal plunged into the thicket the guides followed their strong throats propelling sounds that echoed to the unscaled heights The hotel was in an uproar The pale women excited by the storm could not be kept in their rooms they crowded the corridors uttering plaintive cries The quick flashes of lightning revealed little groups huddled together one poor thing quite lost her control She betrayed her terror in a strangely interesting manner rushed to the long door opening onto the balcony baring her white bosom to the storm She was wonderful as she stood there her face rapturous like a woman lifting herself to the embrace of her lover The storm passed The pale women fluttered in the sun holding up their bloodless hands to its warmth chattering laughing over their thrilling experience Mary was terribly worried about her friends The carriage had not come back The proprietress thought the party had been driven through the short cut to the pastor s ch let But the shot said Mary The woman looked grave It was not hunting time When the carriage drove up with Julie and Father Cabello Mary knew something terrible had happened She grew very pale but she had been trained to ask no questions Julie was quiet with wide open horror filled eyes Father Cabello took Mary s hand and spoke gravely There has been an accident Mr Steele has been lost in the storm they are looking for him She caught her breath Mr Garrison The priest pierced her with his understanding eyes Mr Garrison is safe he and his wife will leave here by the early train tomorrow Will you see to everything Yes said Mary Then his voice hardened No matter what happens they must go nothing can prevent that Julie let herself be undressed and fell into a lethargy Mary tried several times to awaken her she would open her eyes and fall again into that trance which was not sleep The pastor came over to the hotel to see Father Cabello They talked long into the night of Floyd Julie of the fight against Martin The pastor repeated again He is one of ours he has done wrong He must make restitution Father Cabello was troubled Julie had shown unexpected strength He must find a way to bring her back to the Church to submission The next morning early Mary was surprised to find Julie up and dressed The hotel was closing that day The trunks had to be locked and taken down Julie watched her moving about If I could get out of this room it is horrible A hotel room before the departure of its occupant with its torn newspapers remnants of food bedclothes thrown in a heap there is nothing more desolate more inexpressibly forlorn They went down to an empty room on the ground floor misnamed the children s playroom The pale women were unmarried or childless Julie moved continually from one window to another when she saw Father Cabello and Floyd coming up the walk she shrank into a corner a terrified hunted thing Father Cabello found Floyd very quiet whatever may have been his feelings he had them under perfect control He answered the priest s questions in as few words as possible and listened without comment to his sophistical justification of Julie Perhaps your wife was not all to blame Perhaps not You know Julie s nature she is easily influenced Yes I know The man must have persecuted her Perhaps he did I don t wish to blame you but knowing what has happened and the desperate character of the man was it right to let your wife travel alone Perhaps it was not right But it didn t occur to me When they entered the room Floyd stood quietly at the door The priest went to Julie and took her hand Julie you must ask your husband to forgive you The answer came again I will not I belong to Martin I will never leave him The priest s wrath was terrible He stormed threatened pleaded she must go with her husband there must be no scandal She must go home to her child Floyd was white to the lips Mary couldn t bear it She rushed out of the room The pastor came up the terrace Father Cabello went out to meet him and brought him in He spoke quietly with deep feeling The guides who were seeking Martin Steele have come down from the mountain Have they found him Yes He is dead There was a silence It was Floyd this time who cried with a rush of repentant agony Martin I killed him I am a murderer No he himself was responsible He met the fate of the rash A man must know the precipices and how to avoid them before he tries to climb Again came the cry from Floyd I shot to kill I shot to kill The guides followed his traces up the mountain there were signs that told a human thing had passed He must have gone over at the first plateau They went down as far as they dared There were broken branches the violence of the fall tore up a young tree with its roots Come with me I will show you where he struck the trail There was madness upon him his senses wandered the inevitable happened They stood in the quiet woods and looked up at the wall of stone where Martin had said I will climb that mountain The pastor put his arm around Floyd My son you have been through more than your share of trouble don t burden yourself with morbid self accusations He was your friend he betrayed you He made the only reparation death Try to think kindly of him Under natural conditions he would have been a brave son of the soil He was robbed of his birthright Julie shed no tears The old fear was upon her the Punishment had come again in the shape of Death and he had paid The priest worked upon this superstitious dread it was the only way to subdue her God had punished her for her crime against her husband He would punish her further she must go home she must go back to her religion God had struck Martin with the whip of retribution He would bring it down upon her shoulders if she did not repent A great calamity would happen to her child She was cowed humble on her knees before him begging for mercy He confessed her and gave her absolution Mr and Mrs Garrison left by the afternoon train they were a pitiable sight these two unhappy children wondering why the world was so dark the pain so hard to bear The priest spoke the last words My children you are going home You will be happy again if you do not nourish your misfortune God has given us the magic of memory and a still greater blessing the gift of forgetting They bowed their heads to his blessing The train left the station wending its way in and out of the tunnels When I watch those undulations said the pastor to Father Cabello I think of a serpent crawling into the great centers of vice carrying with him the modern Adams the curious Eves who will eat copiously of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge The priest smiled The simile appealed to his mind trained in Biblical metaphors I have no fears for our young couple the New World moulds its people The practical life of which they are an integral part will make their road clear to them I have lived long in America It is a land of proof not belief of practical results and a kind of idealism which is expressed in action There is no time for dreams inspiration feeds only on quick realization A land of no secrets where publicity methods are applied alike to business science literature religion That which cannot be exploited is called high brow but there is a saving humor in it all America is a great country The pastor answered with just a touch of good natured satire If there are no secrets how is it that the Church has prospered there The priest smiled enigmatically The Church adapts itself I am going back to Rome with a mind at rest We have held together the thread of two lives which threatened to snap nay three lives there is a boy whose career must be watched closely Other forces are at work race impulses they must be eradicated Is that possible Yes but difficult I shall bring the boy to Rome there all other influences will be neutralized The pastor offered his hospitality for the night which was gratefully accepted It had been a turbulent time ending happily The priest was in a frame of mind harmonizing with the beauty of approaching twilight They sat outside the ch let The pastor filled long glasses with the wine of the Canton which expands the Soul They sat there looking into the Val Sinestra until the sun scattered rubies and the moon threw down a silver veil They talked of the future of religion and the wave of unbelief sweeping over the world When I meet a man like you said the priest I regret the loss to the Church Protestantism was at best a frail child it cannot survive without support Why should it not come back We would kill the fatted calf to celebrate the return of our Prodigal Son The pastor saved the situation with a fine sense of humor My friend we are not father and son we are brothers prodigal children of the great original God of the Hebrews The priest s eyes gleamed Then why not a family reunion It has been my life s dream all sects united in the spacious bosom of the true Faith The pastor nodded in silent approval Then Luther would come into his own At this same moment far away in the East the muezzin was chanting from the minarets calling the people to prayer There is but one God and Mohammed is his Prophet and at this same time millions of humans prostrate before Buddha were praying to attain the perfection of the Soul Nirvana and the chosen people once again in Jerusalem were praising the only God who had led them out of exile into the land of their fathers The priest and the pastor would soon solve their problem they were both approaching with silent rapid steps the solution of the Great Mystery The next morning Father Cabello thanked the pastor again for his good offices He was a practical man and in the light of day dreams evaporate He did not speak of buying the chapel he wanted to go in peace Angela sat at the wheel her quick skilful fingers spinning the yellow thread The girl with her unerring instinct of the unseen felt the air weighing heavily The atmosphere of the house was charged with sadness unhappy spirits had passed through leaving something of their sorrow their passions The anguish of Floyd still lingering in her little room kept her awake at night The dead man was always before her his uneven gait the passionate face the glittering eyes A great longing went out from her to that rebellious soul beating so long against bars a prisoner in his own body The pastor had gone over to the hotel for Martin s one valise and the little deerskin box He spoke to the woman of the house she remembered her father telling of a Staehli who went across seas and never came back The crooked gardener shuffling about chimed in Yes I knew Martin Staehli He had a quarrel with a guide about a woman and shot him dead He was hot blooded The man lost on the mountain was his grandson said the pastor Strange things happen in a lifetime mumbled the gardener Now who would believe to look at me that I was once the champion wrestler of the village The next morning at sunrise the pastor knocked at Angela s door Angela we are going up there today During the summer when they were pasturing the cattle she and the pastor spent many a happy time with the peasant boys and girls who had gone up in June clinging gradually from one plateau to another until they reached the top where they would stay until the weather drove them down Angela sprang joyfully out of bed and went to fetch her basket on the way up she would look for herbs It was wonderful how she spied the rare plants hid away under the rocks and at the bottom of brooks They went slowly at first Angela timing her steps to the pastor s who grasped his stick gaining strength as he climbed Not far behind a guide followed carrying the belongings of the unfortunate man In Switzerland every waterfall river flower bush and tree has its legendary Spirit Miracle stories come down by word of mouth The old grandmother sitting outside the ch let at night a pipe between her toothless gums her needle running a race with her tongue tells the children of the wonders of the mountains In the old days when a mountaineer had been lost on the heights the peasants would go from peak to peak calling his name Where the echo repeated they stopped and would throw down articles of clothing and a large cheese from the milk of the missing man s herd to keep his spirit from cold and starvation They tell of a peasant who was lost They let down his dog on a rope The faithful animal whining in low dog tones eagerly scented the way When they drew up the rope it was bitten through The dog had found the body of his master and would not leave him Whenever there is a thick mist the peasant is seen his dog beside him on the edge of the chasm pointing with a warning finger to the precipice The merry band of dairy workers welcomed the pastor with shrill cries and clarion notes from Alpine horns It was a modest community each one owned his little herd There were many huts where the milk is set in earthen bowls yielding cream butter cheese their only wealth The pastor drew a herdsman aside and spoke to him in low tones A stillness fell on the merry band The man led them across the field to a deep pool fed by mountain torrents at a narrow end was a rough rustic bridge which they crossed in single file and came into a thick pine grove Farther on the clearing was carpeted with roses anemones violets They walked carefully not to crush them then they climbed up a steep rock to a cow hut on the top Angela gave a low cry A man lay on a bed of hay his arm in a rough splinter his face the wax of death She dropped down beside him listened to his heart tried to raise his closed lids He is dead I think not answered the peasant I have seen many such cases of suspended animation from the shock of a heavy fall Then he told them how Martin had been saved from going to the bottom of the precipice by being caught in a crevice of the rocks He was found tightly wedged in covered by the stones that had rolled down The dog had scented the place where he lay It would be a miracle if he lived The pastor patted the head of the animal who would now and again put his paw very gently on the man s chest as if seeking for heart beats Then he d lick the white face wag his tail and stretch himself out again I won t give up hope said the pastor until the dog howls and slinks away Angela was moving about She made a wood fire on the rock outside filled a large iron pot with water and stirred in her herbs with which she would bathe his bruised body They emitted a pungent agreeable perfume The pastor watched her as she stood a bright figure against the dark pine background a blessed child Angela passed the night in a hut with the dairy maids She was intensely awake concentrating her entire spiritual power She ceased to be a human thing she became a Thought a disembodied Will She arose from the bed where the peasant girls were sleeping three together their arms entwined their hair sweeping the ground their white arms and bosoms like ivory in the night light a great picture of future mothers bearing in their bodies the next generation She stepped out into the air listened to the walking of the waters the talking of the trees she heard panting Something warm pressed against her The dog jumped on her whining What was the message Was it death She followed the excited animal over the stones over the pool into the hut The man was lying as she had left him but there was something in his face that made her heart leap She took the limp form in her arms The breath of her young body the life that was in the sap of the trees the minerals of the springs the healing balsam of the air all the natural force in her and more the dynamic power of the spirit went out to him Her hands tingling with electricity moved tensely over his chest his limbs the dog watched helping with his mute soul Suddenly the curtains over the heavy eyes quivered opened then dropped again her fingers on his pulse felt slow intermittent throbs She had dragged him from the depths he hovered for weeks between Life and the Beyond coming back slowly but the mind remained inert The summer was unusually mild they put him outside on a soft bed of boughs where he lay day and night in silence with the dog beside him his eyes following Angela as she moved about She taught him to walk again guiding his steps carefully The pastor came weekly to see him spoke to him but he didn t answer Angela grew anxious Does he think I believe not said the pastor It is a kind of aphasia which time will cure Angela wondered if he could distinguish sounds the chirping of the birds the bark of the dog the music of the herd The peasants would tell in lowered voices of a shadow of a man standing under the pines so still the chamois would come closer closer looking at him with their soft beseeching eyes then they d scamper away August It was bleak The man sat on the trunk of a tree he was without the thrill of life The pastor spoke to him Do you want anything No Do you know me A flash passed over the face Yes The pastor s voice grew stern You will go down tomorrow with the herdsmen You are the peasant Staehli they are your people you are one of them You have been all your life in exile now you are on your natural soil The voice of race will awaken in you you will find yourself The man listened agonized with the intensity of concentration the words cut like sharp stones into him You understand you are the peasant Staehli The answer came back mechanically I am the peasant Staehli The next day Staehli the peasant went down with the herds from plateau to plateau lingering while the weather favored Late in the summer they reached the valley Winter in that little hidden away corner of the world snow without beginning without end scarcity of food dread of the avalanche The peasant is a fatalist accepting the inevitable with silence with awe God is good He sends summer as a rich reward The pastor shared the hard lot of his parish The Devil was always there in the shape of schnaaps driving the simple souls to madness making cretins of their children The pastor fought the Evil One with holy ire like his great ancestor Martin Luther Every night he would take his lantern and tramp over to the Inn sit with his children drink with them moderately see the liquor locked up put the key in his pocket and go his way Many a morning he found the cupboard tampered with pretending not to see the lock had been repaired Now Martin went with him sitting silent answering laconically The pastor gave him much physical labor washed out roads to remake wood to cut and draw There was a landslide a part of the village was under snow Martin worked with pick and shovel to dig out the people carrying the women and children in his arms his strength growing as the hardiest collapsed When it was too cold for the old man Martin went alone to the Inn to lock up One night walking home the sky like velvet studded with clustered diamonds the mysterious blue light on the snow the silence the penetrating beauty threw a spell over him He wandered till the unseen sun shot up faint rays turning the white world into faded rose then memory stirred in him Angela saw him tracing with a piece of charcoal on a board She put slips of paper and pencil in his way he scribbled on them threw them down forgot them They were confused lines crossing recrossing impressionist shapes of mountains and always the faint outlines of a woman s head She put them carefully in a box he would remember some day She saw quick flashes in his eyes sparks blazing up dying out He sat outside the ch let hammering nails into the soles of the mountain boots he had made for himself The Staehlis had always learnt a trade they were shoemakers tanners blacksmiths herders sons of toil and of the soil The pastor stood watching him The snow has melted in the valley the sky is clear We will wander forth to the south first and back on foot when the trees blossom They started off in the early morning An old peasant leaning somewhat heavily on his solid staff of hickory wood a young peasant silent unsmiling Angela put paper and crayon in his knapsack Bring me pictures they tell more than words They tramped through valleys over hills jumping on hay wagons climbing into stage coaches riding the sure footed mountain pony The pastor watched Martin There were blood streaks in his eyes his face was like a wax mask They came to lovely Lugano the Fatima in Switzerland s harem of beauties warm passionate the soft Italian patois Italian air Italian skies Over there across the lake is Milan Rome the Raphael frescoes Martin s eyes gleamed then he shook his head The pastor sighed would he ever wake up Geneva intellectual proud of its men of genius They walked through Rousseau s Island of Exile He was greatly gifted said the pastor but the victim of his own sensuality We are all that said Martin Then the veil of melancholy dropped again When we are conscious of it the cure is there Rousseau was the mind of his generation he might have been its soul but he never found himself Einsiedeln with its monasteries a thousand years old its few sad Benedictine hermits poring over their ancient manuscripts restoring the eaten away remnants kept with pious reverence hidden in old chests Einsiedeln its pilgrims its Life Eternal hypnotized under the spell of religion Arosa the bleak mountains the hopeless sick wrapped in blankets on open balconies Martin shivered Let us go Zurich again with its historical surroundings The pastor told the story of Charlemagne who finding a toad sitting in the nest of a beautiful serpent drove it out and killed it with one blow of his heavy stick There was a banquet at the Palace that night the guards were terrified at the sight of a white spotted snake who crawled into the hall wound herself up on the legs of a chair and dropped a priceless jewel into the goblet of wine which the monarch held to his lips giving him the magic gift of compelling the love of all who set eyes on him A toad in her nest repeated Martin Two months in the cities then the country beautiful the trees heavy with white blossoms bearing embryonic fruit Toward evening the air grew heavy with the day s perfume the night was warm in the valley Martin moved about restlessly I cannot sleep let us go into the woods They walked through dark trails lit faintly by stars shining through the trees then he broke a long silence speaking of himself for the first time slowly timidly The air goes through me it is sweeping away that terrible fear If I could be free of the horror that tears at me the horror of madness The pastor spoke eagerly Fight it Martin drive it out It is an illusion an evil thought that does not exist Martin your soul is in prison beating its wings against the bars of your own obstinacy let it soar I cannot I am choked with wild impulses driving me to distraction I am mad I tell you mad Martin there is a madness which destroys and a madness that reveals such madness has been the salvation of the world Come sit down with me here in this forest where once lived and suffered our great ancestor our patron Saint Mad Martin Mad Martin Then he told in picturesque English lapsing unconsciously into his own musical Romansch the legend of Mad Martin He was one of a lawless band the youngest bandit of them all a beautiful youth with the grace of a wild stag without fear or sense of right prowling about with his carbine robbing killing consorting with lewd women One night a night like this in the woods where holiness dwelt something stirred within him a voice clear beautiful said wonderful things which gave his soul wings Yes that happens sometimes a voice from within said Martin He left the band made his way to the church and begged to be taken in He was rarely gifted the monks saw in him the white fervor of the saint The Lord had changed the murderous rage of the robber into the divine madness of the fanatic He went to Einsiedeln and there it was said heard the voice of God who commanded him to become a monk As the story goes the Lord to try his piety put in his way a last temptation He was walking in the woods reading his prayers when he suddenly came upon a beautiful vicious thing who had loved him in his bandit days she put her arms around him her mouth to his He forgot Heaven He tried to tear himself away Her kisses held him She lured him to her cabin and in the intoxication of passion he took no count of time Her kisses held him repeated Martin She made a plan that would bind him to her forever she plied him with wine until his senses fled stripped him naked crowned him with a wreath of red poppies left him dancing and singing ribald songs a young Bacchus in the woods then she called the priests to witness his degradation They believed her not the young Divine was deep in the under cells fasting praying purifying his body preparing for his ordination She mocked at them Fools He is no priest he is Mad Martin He cannot change his blood still riots in him calling for wine for women If I lie burn me at the stake Mad Martin in the woods heard the angry voices of the people the mocking gibes of the woman and realized his degradation He fled to the cabin locked himself in fell on his knees and prayed for help The chanting of priests the cries of the people grew louder their axes were breaking down the door The poor sinner raised his arms to Heaven with a cry in which his battered stricken soul took joyful flight When the enraged people burst into the cabin they found it empty They searched the cells of the monastery there was no trace of him The Father Superior a holy man of years was calm Wait he will not fail us The day of consecration came among the young priests stood a tall figure in white ready to take his vows He was pale and faint from fasting but his voice was like a bell sounding from the distance As he left the altar there was a bright light on his face The people followed him on their knees He put out his hands blessed them and the cripples threw away their crutches and the sick were well Then he blessed Einsiedeln and made it a holy place for pilgrims in the ages to come He blessed the village under the mountain where he was born sinned and atoned and prophesied its future peace prosperity Then he disappeared before their eyes but he has been kept alive in our hearts and memory Every three years the people of our village give in the little chapel The Miracle of Saint Martin There was a long silence Martin sat his face buried in his hands The pastor spoke again Martin Free yourself of this horror let Hope in Life is knocking at your door with gifts of fulfillment Martin struggled with the torrent of feeling rushing through him then the dry eyes grew moist the tears came The fever of hate the passion of Love the terrible impulse of self destruction a devil tempting in the night the thought of life with reason gone all the dangers of an overwrought mind were washed away in those tears He dropped down broken helpless on the new sweet hay in a little hut near by the cool air swept over him A bird s plaintive call startled the silence an unforgettable night of spiritual revelation Peace It was dawn when he awoke He looked about for the Pastor found him lying in a corner his mantle wrapped about him Martin looked long at the noble snow crowned head then stole softly out came upon a clear pool hidden in the trees we meet them unexpectedly in Switzerland startling us with their limpid loveliness There was a flash of Glory the Sun He felt a sense of elation of new birth The sky turned purple pink gold the color ecstasy crept into his blood Color the life of the world Color clamored in his brain for expression for air he was obsessed with the madness that reveals the divine madness of the artist The pastor stood beside him The sun was climbing Martin pointed to a ball of fire down deep in the lake I m going to bring it up he said He slipped off his clothes and dived in floating twisting himself like a dolphin spouting water in the air then he ran along the green borders his body gleaming in the sun The pastor thought of the legend of the Water Gods They went slowly on foot toward home stopping at the little Dorfs where the peasants greeted them with acclamations A fine lad a Staehli every inch of him Martin returned their gripping handshakes tossed down their schnaaps gave them points on the disinfection of barns and the care of cows danced with the maids on the green kissed them they pelted him with flowers At the door of the ch let Angela stood waiting He put a portfolio in her hands bits of color he had caught on the way Her eyes were fixed on his face This was not the Martin she had known it was like the same face reflected in clear water etherealized by the refraction of light She heard him in the fields his strong voice filling the distance with melody She looked up at the great mountain An unfortunate man called Martin Steele lay there dead The Garrisons came back to their home on Park Avenue With Mary s help and his own will Floyd learnt to diagnose Julie s actions as psychic impulses She herself couldn t do wrong she fought against a subconscious tendency From her girlhood it had always been like that this was the bridge over which he could pass to reconciliation He had every reason to be satisfied with his wife She was in correspondence with Father Cabello whose influence revealed itself in her piety She became very devout Heavenly love drove out the earthly in her She attended daily mass the big eyed woman with her beautiful boy were well known at the Cathedral Floyd noticed after coming home from service a rapt expression on her face she went about with upturned eyes like St Cecilia He had a vision of a black robed nun He spoke to Dr McClaren I am afraid my wife is developing a religious complex I think not answered the doctor I imagine before it gets so far that insatiable emotional craving of hers will find a new stimulus There was something wrong with Floyd His intense desire to forget the unpleasant episode in Switzerland had overstrained his nerves They reacted in a strange manner He d leave his home in the morning with the intention of going to see the Colonel and would find himself wandering aimlessly in quite a different direction He d walk for hours through parts of the city unknown to him he saw strange faces strange places another world He lounged about where the ships came in The immigrants had an irresistible fascination He watched them listened to their unintelligible jargon A dark eyed Madonna with a shawl on her head a child at her breast was not strange to him He knew her she was Julie s sister A bearded old man carrying on his bent shoulders the tragedy of his race looked at him with the eyes of Joseph Abravanel A straight tall peasant with bundles bewildered by the city was Martin s grandfather It was a kind of mental phantasmagoria of those who had worked a sinister influence in his life He couldn t get rid of them he saw their Past their Present their Future the struggles the agony the hopelessness He was flung backward forward with them Must he go on living with them all his life A horror seized him Taxi sir take you anywhere A tall chauffeur with dark goggles took him by the arm and lifted him into the cab Where to sir Floyd bent forward he knew that voice Tom Dillon Mr Garrison You won t say anything Floyd grasped his hand with quick sympathy and drew him into the car Tom choked at first but gradually recovering himself told his story I married Maudy because I couldn t get her any other way Oh she was a kisser She d go as far as the fence but she wouldn t jump it We were coming home from a dance up the road I tried it on Tom she said if you want me you ll have to marry me I married her I didn t take it seriously I thought this way It s as broad as it s long When I get enough there s Reno She flung the dough like Hell I couldn t see any value for it only a heap of rags Anyhow a man can get liquor and women Yes I know Tom shifted uneasily in his seat When you don t earn money melts My credit kept me going for a time Then I had to tell her I was sure she d leave me I m only good to hand out She told me that lots of times She left you Tom s eyes snapped he was radiant with pride She didn t She had an auction sale All her friends were there they wouldn t miss it She sold everything even her engagement ring and paid every cent I owed By God she did There was a choked sob I had to do something to get even didn t I Yes Tom Floyd was beginning to respect him I went to my friends but they wanted solid men in their business and I couldn t blame em I walked about like a crazy man couldn t get a job She kept enough to furnish a band box in the Bronx She does all the work You must see her She s as pretty as a peach and the place is as neat as wax But how did you come to this Tom She sent me to sell the car that hurt me I went and sat around the garage with the boys I was down and out they had money to burn They said Sell nothing doing a car like yours is capital Well I didn t sell I commenced going out nights I was ashamed to be seen but I got over that Then I risked it in the daytime now I flaunt my shame I tell you it s a rotten world when I had money it was a stunt to do my own repairs When I took the crowd out joy riding I was a good sport but to hack for a living is common I m done with that swell bunch Maudy says they re beneath us Then he sat looking at Floyd his eyes begging Tom you ve solved your problem I m proud of you Tom heaved a sigh of relief and got back to business Now I suppose you want to get home I don t know said Floyd wearily Tom gave him a sharp look What are you doing down here anyhow seeing some capitalist off No watching poor wretches come in I ve been through a lot and I haven t quite got my bearings Tom asked no questions but he told Maudy afterwards he was sure Garrison had some trouble with that crazy wife of his You d better come outside with me and get some fresh air you don t mind me taking a fare if it comes my way I ve got another car there s a guy in with me I dope it out this way he gets twenty five per cent of the takings I get the rest and pay for the damn gas The car s on instalment when we pay it off we ll go it equal Fair enough isn t it Yes it is Tom had coarsened the veneer of wealth was gone Floyd liked him that way You ve grown stouter Tom you re the picture of health Tom slapping his chest complacently came in collision with an enormous truck He let out a stream of oaths which paralyzed the physically inferior opponent The poor devil cranked frantically and got out of his way It was your fault Tom not his Of course it was but that alien wouldn t dare open his mouth to a free born American If he tried it on they d wipe him out Tom spoke with a rich Irish inherited brogue which all his college education hadn t eradicated We were talking about me weren t we Yes I ve gained thirty pounds I eat like a hog and I m for Prohibition every time At first I worried myself to bones about Maudy I was afraid to tell her I was hacking Her family s a hundred per cent American and she s damn proud When I brought home money she wouldn t take it You re on the crook Tom and I m going to leave you Then I blurted it all out I was frightened stiff what do you think she did Haven t any idea Tom abused you roundly for a piker Na she just hugged me till I didn t have a breath left Tom she said I ve cried many a long night I couldn t see you making a living God is good He wouldn t let me go begging to my rich friends Hacking s a fine business but there s something against it those flappers Don t take em in your car sooner lose a fare You re good looking and they ll get you Floyd laughed Tom was the right medicine for him They were driving uptown Tom s tongue went faster than the car he had acquired a lot of practical information They re starring the crime wave now all bunk we re no worse than we were Wait till after the election the prisons will be so empty they ll have to turn em into meeting houses What do you think of them stinking Republicans up in Washington Tom don t insult my inherited political party I ve had them handed down to me and I must carry them Tom opened his mouth the brimstone flowed the air was blue then suddenly he was dazzled by two shapely legs encased in flesh colored cobwebs and a pair of bright eyes emitting sparks Taxi Miss He drew up to the curbstone smiling at her showing his white teeth sprang out opened the door dusted off the seat held the rug in his hand She was undecided I don t want to go yet Yes you do but you don t know it laughed Tom A gust of cold wind blew her against him Tom glanced downward Your legs are cold Oh Warm as toast Your blood keeps them warm She twisted her little mouth No my vanity Clever girl Tom lifted her bodily into the car they were old friends now He wrapped her in the warm rug and put a match to her cigarette Who s the melancholy Dane in front Oh He s a guy I m breaking in They drove to Madison Avenue She jumped out and gave him a generous fare I want to go out again tonight call for me He smiled into the pretty laughing eyes Awful sorry Miss but there s nothing doing I m married He heaved a big sigh She was nice wasn t she Floyd slapped him on the back You re a hero Tom It was a great temptation Tom beamed They ve taken it into their pretty heads to star the chauffeur We re the cowboys of the East We drive and slash about and lasso them in Say I m afraid I m going to lose my man handsome lad good family There s a little snipe baiting for him and she ll hook him too At the garage he found a note Married this morning to Ida family approve Tom s sorrow was pathetic They re rich brokers They ll put him on the street He ll never be able to earn an honest penny again Where shall I find another like him The girls fell for him every time He was a handsome fish You ve got nothing to do help me out just for today You can run a car It doesn t need so much experience and I can t afford to let her stand idle I haven t got the experience Tom but I can hand you the good looks said Floyd modestly Tom was jubilant he d have to keep his mind on the wheel and a few knocks would shake him up Now I ll give you the fruits of my experience Before you turn a corner blow the horn then stop and listen Don t try to pass anything let the other fellow smash you up then you ll get damages The wise guy says we ve got a third eye in the back of our heads Exercise yours it ll work after a while When an old woman or a cat gets in front don t run her down jump off and put her on the sidewalk Train your ears to hear the pistol in a man s pocket Keep your foot on the brake and a curb on your temper a timely joke can make it a dollar more You ll get into tough places so does a doctor Your fare is your patient save his life if you can When it comes to a toss up you know who gets the preference Never argue with a crook take whatever he gives If it s nothing say thank you and get away Don t let pretty feet lead you astray A man s strength depends on his disposition and the time of night If you fall for it forget it Do what you can t help but whatever you do don t get found out It s all contradiction you do something now and you don t do it the next time If the same thing happens twice it s never the same thing You ve got to be not only a good chauffeur but a good actor a good talker a good curser a good fighter a good navigator a good all around regular feller and then you don t half fill the bill Now scoot Yes sir said Floyd and plunged into the depths of the night city His first venture in the taxi business was a personal success Taxi sir taxi Miss take you anywhere where to Miss The women jumped in at once he picked up two going to the theatre Would he call for them at eleven thirty With great pleasure answered Floyd He helped them out and stood with his hat in his hand He forgot he was a chauffeur for a moment Then he drove people uptown downtown all over town guiding his car in and out of the great mass of congested traffic A young fellow rushed at him Drive for your life my wife is dying It was up in the Bronx Floyd put on the speed He got away from two policemen and landed at a brick house with the blinds lowered The man dashed up the steps Is she alive Thank God He threw Floyd a bill You did well my man keep the change Floyd felt like a public benefactor Hacking was a noble profession He was hailed by two men who jumped in He didn t like them He heard the pistol looked into the butt of it They gave him a street number outside the city limits Drive like Hell He did The men jumped out into a vacant lot Now cut away and don t squeal Floyd said Thank you and shot across the town He was held up and questioned No he hadn t seen anybody He had no compunctions He wouldn t give the guys away that wasn t sport Then he took the car back to the garage and went home in the subway He had thirty dollars He put fifteen in an envelope addressed it to Tom and wrote on a slip of paper Dear Tom Here is half the boodle It was a great experience Ready to help out at any time Tom got back early to the garage washed his khaki suit hung it up to dry cleaned his car looked over the motor He waited for Floyd but he didn t show up he was sure the car would come back damaged He expected that but he hoped Garrison wouldn t get hurt Then he grew impatient It didn t matter to that guy how long he stayed out his wife wasn t waiting for him He said good night to the man in the garage told him to look out for a green hand and showed him where the bandages were Then for a bit of exercise he walked up to the Bronx taking a drink now and then to ease his mind It was two o clock when he opened the door of the little flat The kitchen was spotless the blue and white oilcloth shone like marble tiles There was a tray on the table with cold corned beef and three large baked potatoes the coffee was gurgling on the gas stove He devoured everything in sight washed up the dishes then went into the next room and stood at the bed Maudy was in a deep sleep how pretty she was She must have been very tired or she would have heard him come in She d been scrubbing that damn kitchen floor again She couldn t wait till Sunday morning that was his job He looked at her small hands They were rough from the washing soda and the nails were not manicured He had to kiss them he couldn t help it She opened her eyes smelt the hootch Tom you re going it you ll break your neck one night and I ll be a widow take a bath The sleepy eyes closed she dropped off again Tom put a roll of bills under her pillow slipped out of his clothes and fell on the sofa He didn t take a bath he d gotten over that pastime he had something better to do Floyd woke up the next morning his head aching his limbs weary The experience had battered his body but shook up his mind His share of the boodle lay on the table three five dollar bills He examined them curiously turning them over and over the first money he had ever earned Was it money No he threw away much more than that paltry sum every day But this was different he had worked for it with the sweat of his brow He felt the pressure of the masses who were earning their bread This meant money to them He remembered how the Colonel looked at him when he told him to sell something they were needing more and more You re destroying capital said the Colonel You should preserve it it s your only source of income Capital capital He wondered if they had blown in all his father had left blown in where into the air like soap bubbles which glittered for a moment in the sun then burst and disappeared He put his hand to his head Where could he go to pass the morning Julie was not visible until twelve She was lucky the day was only half as long for her Then that queer feeling came again he went to see Dr McClaren How s your wife said the doctor Very well as far as I can see I want to speak to you about myself my mind wanders I cannot concentrate nothing interests me I go back always to the past the things I have lived through haunt me You are trying too hard to forget I don t understand No you don t If we wipe out memory we throw into the dust heap of oblivion the best part of our life experience But if that experience is unbearable We can make it bearable We must work it the right way But I cannot see how Father Cabello spoke about the gift of forgetting The doctor smiled I am not for such narcotics We shouldn t go about hypnotizing ourselves A man of mind should be able to deal with the complications of his nature in an intelligent manner This meant nothing to Floyd the doctor was talking over his head I ll try to make it clearer to you You have got yourself tangled up What you think so terrible one day will be precious to you in years to come How do you stand financially I don t know I m not sure badly I think The doctor knew he had seen the Colonel I want you to try to get rich Floyd had a shock He looked sharply at the doctor there was no glare in his eyes but he was fingering a paper cutter no he wasn t mad but he was a mind reader Floyd had been thinking of money in a vague way wondering that so many people whose names he had never heard had bobbed up as millionaires The pursuit of wealth may be sordid but if we succeed we are compensated by a gratifying sense of self confidence authority power not speaking of the good we can do with our ill gotten gains As for the spiritual side being starved well we don t think so if we concentrate on the world of the spirit it will demoralize us in our practical life which is our end of it We must uphold that for the sake of bankrupt Europe Doctor I dreamt last night that I was enormously rich Good make it a complex It will drive more harmful ideas out of your mind Come and see me again I am curious to know how my prescription s going to work Floyd found the Colonel erect well satisfied he had no complexes he wasn t married How do I stand The Colonel hesitated Come out with it I want the truth Well you ll have to practice strict economy to make up for your enormous expenditure of the last few years Do you want to sell your house Economy Sell the house Julie impossible Nowadays a man can t live on interest Floyd snapped his fingers Economy bah We ll have to create new capital The Colonel opened a drawer took out a card of the Garrison estate kept as a physician does the history of a patient s disease then he placed a map on the table It was interlaced with red lines designating the shrinkage Floyd looked over it The entire water front is crossed off I see Yes the Martin Steele Corporation bought it for investment By the way that was a great thing young Steele did What thing He left his entire business to his employees equal shares and the money to keep it going Waldbridge told me about it with tears in his eyes the other day at the memorial service they gave for him Memorial service Didn t you know I saw Mrs Garrison there but she was gone before I could get through the crowd Julie there She hadn t told him He thought he knew all her movements It was wonderful I wouldn t have missed it for the world They are going to screen it It was a queer mixed crowd artists he had saved from starvation musicians he had sent abroad women he had started right they all got up and told their stories It was like a Christian Science service A man sang a barber named Hippolyte well known on Fifth Avenue a wonderful voice They say an opera manager has engaged him He sang psalms in Greek and Hebrew wails in the minor key just tore at your entrails He set them all crying One poor cripple made a scene swore he saw the dead man s spirit Of course that hypnotized the others they all saw it There was a tall man in a corner the light struck him for a moment I tell you Garrison I ve got the hide of a rhinoceros but it made my flesh creep Now there are two left of those river shanties we ll pull them down and build one big office building Floyd didn t hear him he was in the church listening to the voice of Hippolyte the cries the prayers for Martin the philanthropist the good man He forced himself to say something I knew Martin Steele all my life but had no idea of that side of him Nor I but most men keep the best part of them hidden Yes said Floyd tracing lines on the map I ll go down with you and look at those shanties I want money and lots of it every fool s got it I can be as big a fool as the next one The Colonel didn t contradict him but he doubted if Garrison would ever be that kind of a fool BOOK III Future the hidden meanings of Past and Present a dark picture Imagination flashes the light of Prophecy foretells life s realization or disillusion the Soul s victory or defeat Fiction my Masters All is Fiction BOOK III It took some years to become a rich fool but Garrison accomplished it He had no business ability at least that is what he told people and honestly believed it how could he he had never been in business He thought it well over and became what he had always condemned in others a gambler He risked every dollar he had and all he could borrow in hazardous real estate speculations It was touch and go many times as the values rose and fell They called him Lucky Garrison he knew better but there was a grim satisfaction in his success He realized as he had learnt to manipulate money that a man can attain nothing without it Other big interests developed Every bit of his energy came into play there was always some interesting thing coming up which led to great connections such as international finance and the like New deals got to be a necessary physical tonic like a cocktail before dinner and a strong cigar and black coffee after He scanned the morning paper at the breakfast table looking carefully over the financial news and rate of exchange We are sailing into prosperous times said he to Julie He was an optimist like all good American millionaires Julie had no opinion she smiled As Dr McClaren predicted her religious mania passed off she was now deeply interested in Art a patroness of the Museum and much sought after by budding talent Floyd encouraged this mania it was harmless There was a busy day before him a big deal to close he was in a hurry to get to his office She went with him to the door He looked up at the imposing staircase and beautiful Tiffany glass window He hated it once how could he have been so prejudiced It was all in the very best of taste Julie was perfectly framed in it I ll meet you at the Museum about five o clock we ll drive around for an hour I forgot to tell you I ve invited some men to dinner it s business Do you mind Julie smiled again Oh no With a sudden impulse he took her hand Are you happy Julie She looked at him what made him ask that Oh yes I have every reason to be Is there anything I can buy for you Nothing She stood watching him drive off and waved her hand It was well known in their circle that the Garrisons were a very devoted couple Floyd leaned back in the car puffing at a cigar The years had changed him the sensitive boy had become a man of affairs a Capitalist He was very sane his Puritan instincts rebelled against the rioting emotions of the Latins His life was made up of facts and figures ultimately he would have become an image of clay like his father s statues but there was a secret element of his life of which no one had the slightest clue The Past had ceased to torture him it became a consolation He lived over and over again the Romance of his youth the agony the passion his first years with Julie the rage of the murderer the whole tragedy but it didn t hurt him now Martin was dead forgiven We count the years we have lived to know how old we are correct mathematics but our age corresponds to other numbers Heart swings are the rhythm of our seasons recording in spiritual time the real life The car stopped in Twelfth Street Floyd jumped out stood for a moment looking up at the imposing twenty story office building which he had erected on the site of his old home It had rented well There was not a room empty He had retained an office for himself on the third floor He sat down to his desk read his mail He was about to sell the building the psychological moment had come to turn it over and get a handsome profit He never kept any real estate very long New York neighborhoods change and values fluctuate Then it occurred to him quite suddenly that the room in which he sat was about the height of his father s workshop in the little house where he was born There was no emotion but it was strange he had never thought of it before He looked at the heavy safe the walls lined with repositories where contracts were kept and saw clay images He looked down at his desk it was littered with old rags bits of arms legs a young man with an agonized face dropped a candle He smiled What courage youth has It was well done The home of his childhood was still his he had not desecrated it He saw Mary flying past him up the stairs she had become a world figure the head of an international organization of nurses When Julie s headaches came on Mary was always there He d go softly to the door and wait he didn t knock he knew she d come out Mrs Garrison is much better I m sure she ll be all right in the morning Then the worn face dim eyes streaked hair would vanish She stood again at the window in her bare room where they had loved each other for a moment The telephone at his elbow startled him Julie s voice would he order some flowers for the dinner table Certainly and a bunch for you Anything else Yes her tone became confidential What wine do you want served are the gentlemen heavy drinkers No but they ll take all you give them He dropped the receiver smiling How eager he used to be to do all those small errands the night of their house warming he drank too much That Swede was a nice man The den on the top floor was hung now with maps of suburban towns new fields for speculation he spent many evenings poring over them Somehow his business mind always worked well up there in that room where a man was murdered by his wife The stenographer put a paper before him He started came back to reality it was a bill of sale and very satisfactory I ll close the deal tonight Then he commenced searching in an old desk for some papers he wanted and came across a sealed envelope on it was written Boodle Boodle What did it mean He broke the seal and took out three five dollar bills Tom Dillon He had quite forgotten him but he had a vague idea that he owned a Taxi Company and was strong in local politics He put back the fifteen dollars resealed the envelope and wrote on it The foundation of the Garrison fortune He would give the story to his publicity man how an impoverished son of wealth started in life by earning fifteen dollars as a chauffeur Tom Dillon was the real thing What was the real thing Had he found it or was he chasing phantoms He had that feeling sometimes in his most successful moments it was a queer sensation as if he had caught a thing of vapor that melted out of hand and challenged him again from far off and again that shadow race He thought often of Tom Dillon after that and one election night he saw him in the crowd with a fine young fellow the image of his father they were laughing and nudging each other like two boy friends Floyd shook off a feeling of loneliness and got out of their way Julie was recovering from an attack which left her mentally exhausted She lay back in the sedan her deep rimmed eyes like smouldering coals She arrived at the Museum an hour before the time agreed on with Floyd wandered through the rooms making notes about the hanging and grouping of new pictures There was a small canvas in a corner which she thought was somewhat crowded in She asked about it It had been received very recently and was not yet catalogued Yes it was badly hung She sank down on a divan before the picture a Swiss landscape with a mountain background sloping down to a grassy plateau below a bank of mist through which could be distinguished an old chapel with a broken cross on top In a corner hardly visible to the naked eye she read Val Sinestra and underneath two letters M S She bent nearer looking eagerly into the picture Was it her imagination or did she really see a shadowy outline of a man with a white figure in his arms Martin Martin with flaming eyes distorted face desperate mad A charming picture isn t it like a Corot It s the first of this artist he s not known in America It was a member of the committee who spoke Then Floyd came up and introduced his business friends She smiled asked them if they had seen some gems in the next room and led them away from that picture in the corner On arriving home she went through the house looking for something and finally found it hidden away on a top shelf covered with dust it was a small glass vase with a delicate stem The engraving was beautiful like a white mist over it The butler washed it and held it up to the light colors flashed through it It s Bohemian glass Madame It will break easily No It s very strong I ve had it a long time She put it on her bed table with a dark red rose in it From that time the headaches were less frequent the ravings about punishment ceased Mary said to the doctor I think she s getting over those horrible nightmares I m glad of that said the doctor wearily He himself was suffering from an attack of nerves He was getting old and the hives of human bees he cared for didn t always contain honey They stung him at his patients table at births at marriages at deaths less so that was a release He fought them with his Scotch tenacity but they grew too much for him Finally he got rid of them by retiring from active practice and putting the whole bunch without names or dates into a book on psychical research which became celebrated Julie devoted much time to her boy took him in her car every morning to St John s College called for him in the afternoon preached religion to him at home warned him of the great evils which arise from lack of it She had been very negligent in her youth and was punished for it Religion was a great consolation He listened to her with deference He was extraordinarily gifted and devoured everything he could lay his hands on in the way of serious reading His father was proud of him but there was a growing sense of uneasiness about his religious studies He saw little of the boy who spent his evenings in his own room filled with books he had bought himself in the old book shops Floyd couldn t understand them The maps which hung on the walls of his den were more intelligible A distant cousin of Julie s came to America ostensibly on business The Bank taken over by the family had grown enormously rich under American management Mr Gonzola was highly cultured a dark handsome man with white hands and long tapering fingers He was delighted with the boy and his knowledge of international literature He found him reading Renan That s forbidden isn t it The boy answered with a gleam of humor Not forbidden but not taught I read all they recommend in school and all they forget out of it Then came a letter from Father Cabello to Julie He was very glad to hear that everything continued to be so satisfactory with her The wonderful gifts of her boy interested him he saw in his genius the hand of God leading him into the Divine path They must decide now about his career Julie handed the letter to Floyd who read it carefully and understood its hidden significance This means the priesthood Yes said Julie but don t speak of that to Joseph That evening at dinner she said Joseph would you like to go to Rome to visit Father Cabello The boy s eyes lit up Oh yes it s the dream of my life And I would like to go to Vienna to see your people Mr Gonzola spoke quietly his arm around the boy Let me take him Julie I promise you there will be no influence Our family has been split into different religious camps for generations those who have remained true to their faith have made no effort to bring the others back We do not proselytize The missionary is unknown to us Julie hesitated looked at Floyd it was a great responsibility The boy was bending over eagerly watching his father who decided quickly as was his way in business His theory was when a man weighs the pros and cons of an enterprise the difficulties grow so great that he generally ends in not undertaking it He would give the boy his chance he was old enough now to decide for himself Go with Mr Gonzola said Floyd The boy flung his arms around his father I will do what is right I m sure you will my boy answered Floyd At that moment he caught sight of Julie s face reflected in the mirror it was lit by a quick flash of joy When Father Cabello received a letter from Julie informing him Joseph had sailed with a Gonzola he proceeded at once to counteract any possible baleful influence He communicated with the Catholic members of the family in Vienna hinting that the boy was destined for the church This branch of the Gonzolas were devout Catholics generations old they welcomed Joseph affectionately and brought him as early as possible to Rome There he remained for some time a member of Father Cabello s household coming and going at will The priest watched waited the mind of the boy was not yet ripe for decision Joseph was dazzled with his first glimpse of the Pagan City its remains of Hellenic civilization the pomp and splendor of its churches the Cardinals in their decaying palaces clinging to the traditions of the Past the art of the great Masters those faithful servants of the Church with their wonderful portrayal of legendary religion The unearthly beauty of their divine types fired the boy s imagination stimulated him like rich wine tasted for the first time taken again in long draughts until his senses reeled The people fascinated him with their magnetism their emotional sensuality their worship of women symbolized in the Blessed Virgin and Child their passions jealousy hate revenge repentance He roamed day after day through the streets sat for hours in the churches listening to the chanting of the priests with a pleasant sense of drowsiness like the after effects of a narcotic He followed the processions of monks pilgrims peasants into churches away from churches sprinkling with holy water kissing burnt pieces of sacred wood and always that music Oh that music swelling in waves of overpowering sadness from the throats of unsexed men the terrible sweetness of it sucking him down into the waters of oblivion of self deception the soul in safety interceded for the load of personal responsibility fallen away care free on earth secure of Heaven an unutterable sense of rest from that torturing brain which keeps persecuting with its unceasing cry Think while tis day for the night cometh when no man can think In moments of realization he would say to the priest Father I am going to Vienna I must go The priest did not keep him back The boy must live through the inevitable experience of intoxication reaction submission He was travelling smoothly he would arrive safely When Joseph went from Rome to Vienna to visit the Gonzolas he was in a state of mental unrest and indecision The artist in him shrank from activity He was very sensitive he couldn t bear pain disappointment The Church would be a shelter from the materialism of the world It would be ideal to work for the poor The garb of piety appealed to his imagination a priest walking among the wretched the persecuted the unhappy giving everything his material wealth himself living a simple contemplative life The beauty of it all still remained with him keeping him in a semi intoxicated emotional state He thought of the works of immortal art created in the quiet of the cloister He was sorely tempted not by the flesh like St Anthony but by the spirit and the longing for release from a leaden sense of responsibility If not that what He saw nothing for him in the future His father had at least the satisfaction of success He himself had created his capital It was a game like racing roulette politics a game life a game what else what else It was all so ugly the yearning for beauty came again he was sorely tempted Mr Gonzola s wife and three daughters were models of domesticated womanhood Their home was very modern with just enough of the idealism of religion to give it spiritual charm The girls were well educated practical women keenly alive to the responsibility of their wealth full of enthusiasm and hope for the future of the world They received Joseph with great cordiality helped him perfect his German and were silently sympathetic toward his unsettled spiritual condition of mind Mrs Gonzola was one hundred per cent maternal she mothered her husband her daughters her friends her poor and any stray animal who instinctively came to her for shelter Joseph was her life s crowning joy the realization of a hope long dead a son She found him too thin too pale poor boy he had never known the cuisine of Israel the finest in the world No Cordon bleu can equal the Jewish mother who cooks with the subtlety and cleanliness of religious tradition and puts into her cakes the honey of love This healthy sane atmosphere was a good tonic for Joseph s over excited mind Mr Gonzola s ethics were very simple He kept the two principles of life wide apart and gave to God what was His to men what was theirs He was an able man of business and did not consider a good bargain with legitimate profit ungodly Sometimes he had an uneasy feeling the religious ground was slipping like sand from under his feet He said to Joseph with a sigh I do not live up to ritual laws as strictly as I should My daughters won t let me but I am going to take you to Frankfort to visit the head of the family Pedro Gonzala who has preserved the original spelling of our name and the tradition of our ancestors In his home you will see pure orthodoxy but don t forget the responsibility is on my shoulders I have given my word to your mother and I want to keep it if possible Joseph laughed Mr Gonzola was an honest man The family of bankers with branches all over the world were assembled this year in Frankfort Pedro Gonzala despite his great age was consulted about every detail by the young men of the firm from fifty years old and upward The children under fifty stood meekly silent and listened to warnings against the ardor of youth and the temptation of speculative times The house of Gonzola had braved many storms was sometimes drawn into international financial catastrophes but it had always kept its honor unimpeached and continued to live up to its reputation as creditors of the world These cold men of finance led a dual existence When they stepped over the thresholds of their palatial homes the world outside was forgotten They lived their religious life with extreme exactness Their wives and daughters were faithful to the Law in their domestic life their marriage life and in the education of their children They were the remains of a vanishing caste which lived upon its own fanaticism When Joseph first met Pedro Gonzala in his private office he saw a very old man wearing a black silk skull cap otherwise well groomed and modern in appearance He was seated at his desk surrounded by the members of the firm who listened to him with great respect The old gentleman came to business every day in his carriage although he had many cars but was never known to ride in them He was interested in the breeding of horses frequented the races and patronized art music and the theatre Most of his time was devoted to philanthropic enterprises but he kept a firm hand on the ship of finance of which he remained until the end of his life the undisputed head He questioned Joseph about his mother remarking upon the success of the Gonzola bank in New York He knew all about lucky Garrison who had shown himself very able He invited Joseph to dinner at his home The Gonzala mansion was sheltered from the gaze of the curious by a closely planted row of very old trees whose entwined branches symbolized the unity of the family a treasure house of antiques from all parts of the world collected with taste and discernment by each succeeding generation The picture gallery was celebrated for its rare masterpieces Joseph took great delight in a corner of family portraits But the most cherished treasure of Pedro Gonzala s home was Ruth his granddaughter just approaching womanhood she was all that was left of his immediate family The World War had swept the younger men away He had lived ten years longer than the allotted Biblical time he was life worn but before he went to his long rest his little Ruth must be married to a righteous man a student of the Talmud and of equal birth Such a one was difficult to find Pedro Gonzala stood in the grand salon surrounded by beautiful dark eyed women and serious men of finance He welcomed Joseph in the name of the family as a great grandson of that learned man and deep thinker Joseph Abravanel who fought with all his strength against the wave of assimilation which had engulfed his immediate family You my boy are in the third generation of those who were led away from the old tradition it is not your fault but no student or thinker can afford to neglect the study of a race which gave to the world the first revelation of one God Hebrew thought in its inception its ethics its morals is the pure wine of religion in America they have thinned it with the water of reform and put it into fine looking bottles with gold labels There was a ripple of applause the old gentleman told his little jokes like an actor expecting response which the family gave at the proper time then he related the oft repeated story of his youth when his dear Sarah God rest her soul was alive He led the boy before a portrait painted by Rembrandt representing a stately handsome matron At a ball in Paris given to them by the diplomats and aristocrats of France there were rumors of war and much disquietude He himself was absent called away to a serious Cabinet consultation The guests crowded about Mrs Gonzala who was gracious and smiling Are you not worried Madame asked a celebrated diplomat Oh No laughed Mrs Gonzala I am certain there will be no war because I will not permit my husband to lend the money for it Ruth stepped daintily down the marble staircase Her grandfather had bade her array herself It was a gala occasion the reunion of the family and a welcome to a young Gonzola from America Around her neck were rows of costly pearls diamonds sparkled in her hair she wore a cape of ermine a young queen of an old dynasty an inheritance of beauty and purity She put out her hand to Joseph and said Welcome cousin Joseph raising her face to his He bent down and kissed her cheek they stood looking at each other speechless The women nudged each other What an ideal couple they might have been it was a great pity The long dinner table was a beautiful picture with its service of gold priceless glass and fine linen and the Patriarchal figure at its head Ruth sat beside him I am dazzled said Joseph such lovely women such jewels such wealth We are not wealthy answered Ruth because it is a principle of the family to give away a large part of its income and you will see that we live very simply but tonight all this is in your honor Our jewels furs laces have come down to us from generations back our home and pictures can never be sold unless the business goes under and that will never happen I hope not said Joseph it has meant too much to the world but all these jewels must have been bought once Oh yes in the times of the Ghetto when the Jews were not allowed to own real estate so they bought jewels and hung them around the necks of their wives who wore them in secret and gave them to their daughters and daughters daughters This has an interesting history She touched a necklace of shining pink living things lying against her white skin When the Romans separated Queen Berenice from her kingly lover the last thing he did was to throw these pearls around her neck She went back to her own dominion and the pearls after her death became the property of the Temple We have had them in our family for many generations He bent down to examine the pearls but his gaze stopped at her soft dark eyes And you will give them to your daughter Yes said Ruth but I don t think I shall ever marry Why insisted Joseph Because her voice dropped he bent lower to listen I can only marry one of my own faith they are all dying out They have forgotten their ancestry Father Cabello had reached the zenith of his earthly ambition the Cardinalate He had easily won in the race for advancement a man of wealth and winning personality The magic word America gave him prestige it was a sign of goodwill to the church in the United States The priest was generally beloved his doors were always open to the poor to whom he gave liberal hands they crowded the steps of his house penetrated into his apartments All efforts of his attendants to keep them away was futile Let them in said the Father they will be my future associates for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven His secretary a member of an old patrician family shrugged his shoulders his unspoken thought was if I have to live with them in Heaven I hope I ll never die The Cardinal had been confined to his room for some days with an attack of weakness the result of an overtaxed heart The doctor said to him Your Eminence you must shun all excitement no more receptions no more arduous night work no activity of any kind The Cardinal smiled That would be premature death I must take my chances But at present I cannot work I have no strength His new honors had not changed his mode of living His palazzo a relic of past grandeur was simply furnished with only the necessary chairs and tables and completely bare of drapery or superfluous decorations The Roman sun flooded his rooms through the high arched windows The garden of boxwood hedges and old trees was beautiful and fragrant he could stand on his terrace and see the cupolas and innumerable spires of the city of churches and listen to the bells pealing now soft caressing pleading now loud harsh commanding those eternal bells that have welcomed into the world and followed out of it millions of souls The Cardinal sat in his private apartment His fingers tapped nervously on the polished wood of the table upon which was a dish of fruits figs honey and a silver jug of iced water a habit he had brought from the land of his adoption He was waiting for Joseph In the excitement of his new honors weeks had passed with only now and then the accustomed epistolary greetings but the time was approaching to speak of the future If he could realize his plan thought out in every detail this boy would inherit his wealth would carry on his work among the poor A spasm of agony turned his lips blue his face livid He quickly dropped a tablet into a glass of water and swallowed it The unbearable pain slowly subsided the brain moved again If God would be merciful and let him live to see the boy ordained A flash of determination of invincible Will Yes it would be It must be He forgot the dark cornered room he saw the cathedral the procession of priests the young divine Why didn t the boy come He was eager to stamp his plan with the seal of realization A shaft of sunlight shooting through the window struck the chair opposite him His sick heart bounded Seated there he saw his old friend and enemy Joseph Abravanel He slowly made his way to the chair passing his hand over it it was empty His thought had conjured up a momentary vision How often had they sat like that opposite each other at a table set with fruit and wine the long evening passing like a flash over the chess board which became symbolical of the spiritual struggle between them The tenacity of that old man who would not give up hope even after the conversion of his daughter You have won this time but there is the next generation When Julie was born he was cheated again in this game for souls but he would not give in God s chosen people cannot die they may lose the path but they will find it again they will come back in the third generation A spasm of fear convulsed the priest Joseph Abravanel had the prophetic clairvoyance of his race No No The boy was a good faithful child of the Church a believer in the true Faith He glanced again at the chair opposite again he met those eyes long extinct spirit eyes The servant announced Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison Joseph threw himself with a gush of irresistible love into the old man s arms then remembering he dropped on his knees and kissed the ring of His Eminence The Cardinal raised him looking long into that mobile face aglow with the joy of life Sit down Joseph we have much to talk over No no not there here He pointed to a chair close beside him there were three now at the table indomitable spirits one invisible The Cardinal felt his way asked about the family he had not heard from Julie for some time Oh Mother is a bad correspondent but if I miss a mail she cables His laughter rang through the high vaulted room Father wants me to go into the banking business the Gonzolas think I have talent for it He was peeling an apple careful not to break the ring the Cardinal noticed his long tapering fingers his white hands Well what do you think about it The boy s eyes shot a mischievous gleam Our great ancestor on my father s side was a baker on my mother s side they added a letter to it and it became banker Now if it is true that the third generation goes back I think I d rather make cakes than money The Cardinal laughed the boy s merriment was contagious Then he grew grave again My son there is something in each generation which belongs neither to the Past nor the Present but to the Future it is God s will working in us The time has come to tell you of my wishes for you I want you to continue my work to take up the staff of Divine Duty to lay upon the altar of renunciation the great gifts bestowed upon you by an All Seeing God you will give your youth your manhood your old age to save those helpless souls who need your intercession your spiritual support You will one day succeed me in Rome it has been my only earthly dream ever since I held you as an infant in my arms My time is short I want to see you enter upon the path before I die The boy was on his feet his face quivering with grief the tears streaming from his eyes No no you must not die I love you I love you If I could prolong your life for one hour I would give my right hand He held it up firm strong beautiful The Cardinal s imagination played him a trick again He saw another white hand held up old feeble trembling the light shone through it The boy s heart was heavy that beloved face before him with the pallor of death on it How could he say what he must I have thought long and deeply of your wishes for me I cannot I cannot There is something in me that rebels against the chastisement of the flesh I don t want to think always of death to pray always I want to work I want to live No one can intercede for me I can intercede for no one Each must work out his own salvation The old world is spiritually decaying the young must be the pioneers of a new world We must tear down and dig and set the stones of a new foundation and those who come after us will build The Future will see miracles the human being will awaken to the truth that he himself is God Stop Blasphemer The old man broke into choking sobs Joseph Joseph I am responsible for your soul s salvation this is all madness You will repent when it is too late Father it hurts me to give you pain but it is impossible I cannot I cannot The Cardinal was cold to the soul his boy his heart s idol a heretic an infidel the stripling was strange to him standing there with a look in his face of iron determination He would break that will he must You do not know what you are doing You are too young You have been influenced by that old sophisticated fox Pedro Gonzala I fought a greater man than he and won I will fight again I will save you as I saved your mother No No They have not influenced me I have given up dogma I will not be chained again by ritual I will not be a mummy wrapped in the superstition of past ages I am a living thinking being I am free free The priest s eyes went past him to that shadowy figure looking down now as it had so often done in life at a chess board on the table fingering the pieces moving removing trying new combinations Neither had won it was a drawn game stalemate With a low moan he sank back in his chair The boy gave a cry of terror Father speak to me Speak to me The priest heard him not He had renounced this world for the glory of the next He was going to his reward where there would be no dogma no ritual no religion A terrible fear clutched the boy He looked about despairingly He was forsaking the shelter of those old walls He had stripped himself bare He must go out naked to meet the stones of the Philistines He threw himself down before the beloved guide of his childhood sobbing out his love his loneliness Come back Come back Don t leave me I am afraid afraid He called in vain those wonderful dreams the hope of immortality the joy of Heaven would never come back they had gone into the past like that still form deaf to his entreaties to his cries gone forever Mr Garrison was getting into his coat in the hall it was after nine Good bye Julie I m off Her answer came from above Don t go yet I want to speak to you it is something important With a suppressed feeling of impatience he took off his coat and went up the stairs He wondered how much Julie would ask for She was very extravagant He was surprised to find her waiting at the door of the sitting room for him She had slipped out of bed and thrown on a filmy wrapper he was struck anew by her youthfulness Her skin was like satin She was forty and could easily be taken for ten years younger but her beauty had ceased to disturb him It was an accepted fact like his luck in business As he bent to kiss her she noticed his hair was getting thin on the top He would soon be bald He dropped down on the sofa beside her You looked tired this morning didn t you sleep well said Julie As well as usual Floyd s mind was overstrained his accumulating interests kept him on a severe tension His eyes troubled him and he wore strong owl like spectacles framed in tortoise shell which gave him a look of comic solemnity He didn t tell Julie how very badly he slept his many speculations took gibbering forms and danced around his pillow He spent whole nights in his den where a man had sweated blood He was beginning to feel the significance of that expression At first the thought of possessing a million made his head reel now he laughed at his modest pretensions Desire grows until it ceases to be servant and becomes master He hunted gain like a gambler who risks his last dollar Envious competitors said Garrison s getting to be a skin flint he d sell his soul for money It came back to him from a friend he wasn t annoyed but wondered in a vague way if it were really true When the news arrived of Cardinal Cabello s sudden death and Joseph s decision Julie took it very hard she spent days in the convent praying for her son s soul Floyd consulted with Dr McClaren She ll get over it It s only a temporary disturbance A bit of good news now will set her all right again And how are you Mr Garrison My medicine worked well I see Oh yes said Floyd but times are bad a man must be careful how he invests his money That never troubles me I haven t any to invest You ve been a successful doctor haven t you I hope so The trouble with Dr McClaren was that his bills were ridiculously small He underestimates his own ability said Floyd to Julie A man must set the price of his life s work and as he appraises himself the world values him I have a letter from Joseph answered Julie So have I he keeps me well posted on complications abroad I am sure if he will only get down to it he ll make a first class financier This was Floyd s ambition for his son She took a letter from the table beside her It was long covering many sheets of paper The Gonzalas have been very good to him he is in much better spirits It was terrible that struggle with His Eminence I would have given in She always thought now of Cabello as His Eminence in glittering robes sparkling with jewels Yes said Floyd You always gave in That was the trouble He turned to go Stop a moment you must hear this He pushed away the call of business he would rather have read it himself when he found time at luncheon perhaps He hated to be read to He couldn t concentrate his mind wandered off in figures She read in a low voice very rapidly stopping now and again he knew she was skipping something he wasn t offended He had always felt like a third party and thought of Joseph as Julie s boy It was an interesting letter written in picturesque metaphors just the way Julie s mother used to speak thought Floyd The boy told of his many visits to Frankfort and of closer acquaintance with Pedro Gonzala and his granddaughter They had given a costume ball to celebrate her sixteenth birthday A costume ball that s rather sporty remarked Floyd He had in mind those French masquerades given in his youth where Martin danced the Can Can with indecent French women Oh no answered Julie listen Joseph explains it This was a ball where the family personated their ancestors the portraits in the gallery Ruth took me around told me their history for generations back Wonderful so full of struggle tragedy romance I couldn t hear enough of it It didn t affect me like that those portraits you sent away gave me a cold chill They were not your ancestors said Julie with a touch of sarcasm Then she went on reading They called one of the portraits the unhappy Pedro Gonzala because he was an illegitimate son That was Grandfather I couldn t tear myself away from him he had such brave defiant eyes Dearest Mother I think it is a great injustice to brand a human being like that There is nothing illegitimate in Nature I d rather be the child of love than of calculation born in wedlock Floyd frowned I don t approve of those views I m afraid the boy is catching European radicalism Julie didn t answer she was absorbed in the letter Floyd looked at his watch and jumped up Wait wait it is not finished Mother I ve written you often about Ruth but I m sure you don t know what she is like When I am with her I m afraid to look at her and when I m away I can t imagine how she looks She s something indescribable Mother I have fought with all my might against her because I knew it was hopeless but when she said she loved me I went straight to her grandfather I told him about the struggle with my conscience and our dear friend s sudden death he was very much moved and put his hand over my head and blessed me then I took courage and asked him for Ruth He was silent a long time before he answered I could see he was thinking deeply Then he said The uncompromising adherence of our people to the Law in the days of the Ghetto preserved the virility of the Race but today our blood is in the veins of the world That obstinate orthodoxy with which we are reproached has saved us from being swept away in a great tidal wave of assimilation Come to us We will leave you free in all worldly matters but you must live according to our ritual you must worship in our synagogue you must bring up your children in our tradition You will realize as you get older the righteousness of my demands Floyd was annoyed They will keep harping on those future generations How can we lay down the law for our grandchildren they ll know a lot more than we do Julie evidently didn t agree she kept on reading I walked about for days trying to find some way I wanted Ruth Mother you don t know how much I couldn t keep away from her she was waiting for me in the garden she knew I would come Mother there was something so pure about her such sweetness I have never seen in any human thing She was pale but she spoke quietly Joseph I know what Grandfather has asked you to do for my sake you mustn t do it It wouldn t be right for you We try to bring the Past into the Present to preserve our religion We think we live but it is only a waking dream and we are happy they let us dream but dreams are not for you Joseph you must go out on the high road of Progress and I I must stay here with my grandfather Then I fell into the depths of despair and cried how I cried I won t let you it is a living death you are young young Mother I ll never forget her face when she answered I look young but my soul is old A sob choked Julie s voice herself at sixteen with that old soul Floyd took the letter and read it rapidly to the finish She has shown me the way it is all clear to me now and I am not unhappy We are only separated for a little while and Mother I want you to write a letter to her grandfather and plead for us It might do some good You are always asking me what I want I want Ruth give me Ruth It was pathetic how the boy clung to his childish illusions His mother could give him everything Julie was crying silently The letter dropped from Floyd s hand waves of memory swept over him The struggle between Joseph Abravanel and Father Cabello against him the bitterness the tragedy He was on his feet there was a youthful ring in his voice which had long been absent He flung his spectacles that badge of age on the table His eyes were young again We must bring it about the boy must not be disappointed He must have his love dream he must not lose the best part of his life With a cry of joy Julie came to him and put her arms around his neck they stood together the light of that young romance across the sea reflected in their faces Floyd bent down and whispered I was an ardent lover wasn t I Julie You were so sweet so sweet Then he remembered a business deal and put on his spectacles At the door he stopped I shall write at once to Pedro Gonzala and make him a business proposition which it would be madness to refuse it will be a brilliant future for Joseph This will cure him He will see now that money can buy him everything Don t cry Julie it s all for the best and don t miss the mail It s a five cent stamp to Germany The Colonel lunched that day at the club with Floyd who was full of his plan to dazzle the Gonzolas The Colonel was very sympathetic then he said with a touch of sadness I m getting old People have no use for a bachelor when he ceases to be eligible If I had a boy like yours a wife like yours I d be a happy man Floyd thought a moment I have been lucky I come out well from very serious complications The Colonel thought he meant business deals You often risked too much you were once on the brink of disaster More than once answered Floyd but now things seem to be going my way I would like to do some philanthropic construction work a man must have something to keep him from drying up There was a responsive flash from the Colonel I thought I was the only one who thought like that Floyd looked around at the crowded room there was laughter jingling of glasses the perfume of good tobacco I think they all do Joseph had spent the winter in Geneva studying the classic and modern languages In the spring he joined a band of students on a walking tour through the mountains At Tarasp he bade them good bye he was going to see the Val Sinestra where his mother years before had been caught in a storm and where his father s best friend his Uncle Martin had been lost in the mountains He passed the hotel climbed down into the ravine and stood before the little chapel where by a strange coincidence they had met Father Cabello He pushed open the door How old it was how very old the fading wall pictures the broken windows the time stained Virgin and Child looming up out of the shadows There was a sudden impulse to go to her to speak to her as he used to when she was living to him He gazed and gazed she was drawing him down the aisle He went out shutting the door softly behind him Ghosts followed him as he climbed up the open road then they melted away in the warm sunlight He was soon going home His father s dazzling business proposition had been enthusiastically received by the younger Gonzolas but the old gentleman remained obdurate The boy must accept his conditions Floyd had written to Joseph advising him to give in while the old man lived But Joseph refused to make any concession Ruth wouldn t let him He strolled along his knapsack on his back his hat and cape in his belt a handsome young student one meets them often in the mountains fine happy lads their only wealth the Future He knelt down by a stream caught the falling water in his hands and drank it then he poetized Spring dances in the mountains Winter s young daughter peeps at her Sweet face in the Lake mirror The old Snow man growls His blanket is thin his feet stick out They are warm he is melting He flies to the heights in his March wind aeroplane There he can keep cool The bride robes herself in Green and gold Flowers fall from her long curls The nuptial couch is white With blossoms Wedding bells birds caroling Cattle calls Alpine horns Love time He threw back his head and laughed Ruth would like it He would bring her and show her where he wrote it on their wedding day He read it again it was a whimsical thing He was sorry for the poets of the past who were chained in rhyme The world had been rhyming so long about everything love religion the soul the origin of man People rhymed themselves into a state of poetic fiction then suddenly they found out it was all rhyme and no reason The path ran along the side of the mountain In the valley below he saw people running heard the sound of music in the distance He stopped a barefoot boy who told him it was f te day in the Canton to welcome their great Switzer home from Geneva the artist Staehli Staehli Yes I know I admired his paintings at the exhibition Then he saw a procession of peasants in gala array cows adorned with flowers maidens singing dancing A tall man walked amongst them with swinging step a peasant like the others He puts his hand to his mouth and gives out a long piercing yodel Above at a ch let a woman answers That is Angela his wife she is the doctor of the Dorf she heals with her hands and brews herb tea which has a magic power Oh I d like to meet the artist Do you think he ll receive me Oh yes All are welcome they have the best milk and cheese in the village I ll take you down Near the ch let they were stopped by an enormous hay wagon drawn by oxen The young peasant leading them moved aside smiling at Joseph That s Martin Staehli born and raised here said the boy The artist was standing outside the ch let watching the procession wind its way around the path and out of sight Could I rest here awhile I ve walked from Tarasp I shall have great pleasure He spoke English hesitatingly with a Swiss accent They entered a very large room the light streaming in from all sides This is my studio My home is a little distance away in our family ch let It is old I will show it to you if you are interested in antiques He went to the door and called Angela Angela He looked keenly at the boy You are not a European No I am an American He raised his head with a gesture of pride which became him well My name is Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison The artist put his hand over his eyes Julie s boy The child he had held in his arms He heard again that sweet young voice felt the soft lips pressed against his I love you Uncle Martin Julie s boy Angela came in with milk bread and cheese Joseph thought she was the noblest looking woman he had ever seen The artist sat tracing lines on paper He must hold that vision of the past it would soon vanish Angela apologized for his silence My husband is sketching you he loves beautiful heads Joseph sat willingly for the artist It s only for myself and for you if you will accept it Then pointing to a black band around the boy s arm he said with a touch of fear Are you in mourning Yes for our dearest friend Cardinal Cabello Cabello a Cardinal I am quite out of the world I met him many years ago in America He helped my mother bring me up I was like his own son I had to grieve him terribly before his death but I couldn t help it I must go soon again to Rome there is a large sum of money coming to the Church from my grandmother It was left to me conditionally I have forfeited it Don t look so sad said the artist I want the brightness of you Tell me have you sisters and brothers No I am an only child and very much spoilt Your parents are they living Oh yes and still young My mother is the most beautiful woman in New York The artist caught the smile then set him talking again looking keenly into his face with its quick changes its light and shade He laughed often he would throw back his head with a gush of merriment That laugh thrilled the artist it was like a far away echo it played on the chord of remembrance bringing out a melody long unheard You are not of pure American stock Oh yes my mother and grandmother were born there Mother is of Spanish Hebrew blood Father is of Dutch extraction he is proud of being pure American he forgets the Indian All others are of emigrant origin only some came over on earlier ships A European called us a melting pot I hate that expression people don t melt We are not a smelting furnace To me the United States is like a big Colonial mansion with many windows made up of little panes of glass which I call Race Each one colors his glass with his own racial impulse What color do you see Oh my window looks toward the East where the sun rises it is gorgeous with many colors laughed the boy I think I catch your meaning It would make a good symbolical picture A great prairie and standing in it a White House built on Colonial lines It is flooded with a glare of strong light which in the individual separates into its prismatic colors the different races Yes that s what I mean only an artist could think it out like that Will you paint it Perhaps some day but why not you You have the instinct in you I feel it The boy s face lit up How strange you should know that I love art I ve studied it in Paris I ve been dabbling a bit in oil They say I have talent The man bent forward I have a class of young artists in Geneva they are all unusually gifted Join us How eager he was he hung on to the boy s answer I would like it but an artist s career is too passive for me I have no patience I want action results I want to work for the great World Reformation which is coming I want to help bring down to this miserable unhappy earth a little of the Heaven we have been dreaming of so long We must wake up We must commence now and fight the monster of materialism which is destroying us He was on his feet his head erect his eyes blazing A young David sharpening his sword for the great encounter with the Giant of superstition lies false Gods I must go now May I come again I m going to write all about you to my mother Were you here that time they were caught in the storm Angela put her hand on her husband s shoulder He started looked up I was in America I was very unfortunate there I often lost my way in jungles Race instinct made me restless The peasant blood was strong in me Race instinct repeated the boy I ve felt that but I didn t know what it was stirring in me I can t express it It was like a melody from far far away coming back in snatches like like the strains of a National Hymn It excites me Angela s eyes shone You are living a great romance the romance of race The romance of race yes that s what it is Then he came nearer to them and told his love story Ruth is to me not only my love she is the ideal in my life I am going to take her out of that beautiful dark house with its old portraits I am going to make her soul young again The artist went with him down the path to the bend of the road Where shall I send the sketch To the College in Geneva Would you mind if I gave it to my mother Oh no I will try to make it beautiful Joseph lingered looking again into the artist s face with a touch of sadness I feel as if I had known you a very long time You have He drew the boy to him and kissed him and stood watching the young figure until it disappeared Angela touched his arm Angela that boy that boy Is he the son of the unhappy man who spent the night here Yes The young peasant sent out a call from the barn where he was flinging the hay lightly with a heavy pitchfork into the loft What are you going to do with our boy He does not care for books he has no talent for painting You are not ambitious for him There was a note of reproach in her voice Yes very ambitious I want him to be what nature has made him a peasant nothing could be nobler That night the artist remained in his studio to finish the sketch he worked for hours with intense concentration until the pencil dropped from his numb fingers Then he threw himself down on the couch but couldn t rest Ashes strewn over the fire had smothered but not extinguished it the flames broke through That boy The Past living again with all its wonder of passion its uncontrollable love He went to the window leaned out a white mist hovered over the dark valley His eyes pierced it deeper He was again a desperate man holding a woman in his arms Mad Martin When the sketch was finished he painted it on ivory framed it in silver put it in a velvet case and sent it to Joseph as a souvenir of their meeting It was a speaking likeness it went over the sea a message to his first love The Garrisons were at home The reception tonight was in honor of a distinguished Englishman Julie stood before the mirror putting the last touches to her toilette she wore a creamy lace d collet gown with splashes of red velvet The Gonzola diamonds glittered in her corsage Her maid handed her a letter and package It was from Joseph now the evening would be perfect The boy was full of hope enthusiasm he had just returned from Switzerland where he saw the Val Sinestra and the old chapel she had told him about when he was a child at night before he went to sleep I visited an artist who lives near there He s been in America he didn t say much about himself but he drew me out to get atmosphere for a portrait he made of me which I am sending to you with my best love I am writing him a long letter I hope he will answer He s married to a wonderful woman they say she has magnetic power and it is true she drew out all my secrets I had to tell her about Ruth She loves her husband with her whole soul her eyes never leave him They have a son a big strong peasant lad Mother the artist is the most interesting man I have ever met his hair is turning gray He must have had a terrible struggle when he was young I think he starved he has deep lines in his face I had to tear myself away I love him Mother I love him and I m sure he loves me When I left he put his arms around me and kissed me I felt his heart beating in big throbs Martin s heart beats She opened the package Joseph laughed back at her She gazed and gazed until the young face vanished and she saw Martin with her boy in his arms She sank down in her chair in a rush of hysterical joy Martin alive Happy no no not happy content peaceful at work How wonderful Those two had met they loved each other God had given her absolution How thankful she was how thankful She sprang up peered into the mirror and saw a white despairing face with spotted gray unkempt hair it faded slowly youth had touched it A beautiful smiling woman was reflected there with head erect triumphant free from that haunting fear of years She put out the lights and went to the door with resilient steps then stopped suddenly grew pale as she looked back The room was shadowy one lamp shone down on the little table beside her bed bringing out in sharp relief the torn old Hebrew prayer book beside it an ivory crucifix turning yellow and a beautiful rose eternally young symbols of her soul s secrets its melody its madness Finis TRANSCRIBER S NOTES Italicized text is surrounded by underscores italics Obvious typographical errors have been corrected Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized
