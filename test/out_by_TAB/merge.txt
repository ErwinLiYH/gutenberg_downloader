Chapter XI To My Husband PREFACE An art like pottery making which is nearly as old as the human race is naturally approached with some degree of reverence One thinks of its old masters in various lands and ages how they were content to spend a lifetime in the study and practice of it There is however another thought that comes to mind that this art like every other had to have its beginning Moreover every potter from the primitive man who first realised that clay which held water could be moulded into portable vessels for a like purpose to the artist potter of to day has learned the first steps of the craft It was this thought that encouraged me to study the beginnings of pottery and that leads me to offer this book to those who would also start clay working with no other qualification than the wish to learn how to make pottery CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE I The Clays and Tools II Hand made Pottery III Working on the Wheel IV Methods of Decoration V The Glaze and How to Apply

THE CLAYS AND TOOLS Clay is what might be called the drift of the rocks of ages past Most stone consists mainly of silica and alumina In some bygone age the potash and other alkalies under the action of heat fused these materials into rock Potash is affected by the atmosphere so it gradually left the rock which decomposed and the many particles the fine refuse after various changes became clay Perfectly pure clay or hydrated silicate of alumina is found where some granites and other felspar bearing rocks have decomposed In the course of years the clays especially those on the surface gathered impurities Black clay for example which is found at the top of the bed contains a large per cent of carbon formed by decayed leaves and twigs like coal or peat Strange to say this burns whiter than any other pottery clay It contains more potash than the other clays and fires at a lower heat The different proportions in which certain minerals are found in clays determine their plastic or non plastic fusible or refractory character Potters have not been able to agree as to the reason for the plasticity of clay Some believe that the silica gives it plasticity others that it is due to the water inherent in the clay which is called the water of combination and give as their reason for the belief the fact that burned clay loses its plasticity never to get it again Yet water alone does not make every clay plastic other ingredients are sometimes necessary The early potter used the clay just as it came from the ground but when he began to bake it in the fire he found that tempering materials were necessary Sand was often added to make it easier to handle and coarse sharp pieces of shell or rock helped to prevent the clay from cracking by lessening the shrinkage Later as the art advanced the value of certain materials in regulating the fusible and refractory qualities of the natural clay were recognised There is in clays the play of melting and non melting substances Flint and alumina are hard and uphold the clay in the fierce fire of the kiln potash and soda make it soft and fusible It is believed that the value of ground flint in pottery was not discovered until late in the seventeenth century The story is that a certain potter travelling on horseback was delayed on account of an inflammation of his horse s eyes An ostler wishing to help him out of his difficulty took a flint from the road and after putting it in the fire until it was red hot threw it into cold water It broke into pieces pure white which were easily powdered and applied to the animal s eyes Delighted as the potter was with the cure of his horse the discovery of a white infusible material for his pottery pleased him still more The combination of iron and lime in a clay forms a natural flux For example Fire clay which is quite refractory but which contains a small per cent of iron will by the addition of a proportion of whiting lime become more fusible Iron and lime in larger quantities are found in the clay which is made into red ware flower pots red bricks and other common articles The large per cent of iron gives it its red colour It does not make as strong a ware as other clays This red ware which fires at the lowest heat we will classify as Group I To Group II belongs the yellow or Rockingham ware This fires at a light orange heat from to degrees Fahrenheit It is often finished with a dark brown glaze Mixing bowls and other kitchen ware come under this group Group III contains the buff or cream ware usually made of fire clays This hardens at an intense heat from to degrees Fahrenheit In this group is the fine pottery Art pottery comes under this head Group IV is the buff or cream ware fired at white heat and beyond This is the stoneware On account of the great heat at which it is fired it is possible to use only certain colours in the glazes They are limited to gray brown green and blue Ox blood has been obtained in this ware but it is uncertain Claret and vinegar jugs and butter crocks come in this group Group V is the white or tableware and Group VI the translucent ware or porcelain made of kaolin the purest grade of clay Felspar makes it meltable and translucent and to give it plasticity a small proportion of ball or fire clay is added Pottery clay differs from modelling clay in that it has more stiffening so to speak It is not so plastic but on the other hand it will stand the heat of the kiln which the other will not The addition of whiting or felspar to modelling clay will give the needed stiffness A pottery clay suitable for the work one can produce in one s kiln must be so arranged as to harden at the degree of heat at which the kiln fires Practically we shall have little to do with any but the blue or ball clay and fire clay These are the best for pottery which is to be beautiful as well as useful It is possible of course to use the flower pot clay and perhaps if one can easily obtain this clay and is near enough to a pottery where the red ware is fired so that one s pieces can conveniently be sent there it might be wiser to use it than to buy finer clays that come from a great distance and then be obliged to send one s pottery to a far away kiln for firing The flower pot ware is not strong however and fine glazes cannot be used upon it so that if possible clay that will fire at a greater heat should be chosen A mixture of fire clay and ball or blue clay will give good results and the pieces made with it may be sent to the nearest art pottery or to a kiln where stoneware is fired Having once found a good clay potters rarely change In fact this feeling is so strong with some that it amounts almost to a superstition A potter who has obtained a clay that is satisfactory in a certain State will always send to the same State and bed for that clay no matter how far he may be from it nor how nearly the clay in his own State may come to the analysis of that which he has used The clay is of course brought from the clay beds in caked masses It should be kept out of doors for the wind and weather are good for it In preparing it the great lumps are pounded up fine and put through a sieve in which there are thirty to forty meshes to the inch It is now ready for soaking A common mistake is to pour water upon the clay in its rock state and then employ a boy or spend one s own time kneading it into condition The more simple and practical process is to sift it as already described and then add the powdered clay to the water In this way each particle is wet at once and in much less time the clay is ready for use If it proves that too much water has been provided pour off some after the clay is well mixed and if it is still too moist spread it upon plaster slabs in the air which will soon dry it sufficiently the plaster itself absorbing much of the surplus moisture It is often possible at slight expense to obtain the clay already sieved and mixed from a pottery and this is of course an advantage Keep your clay in a large earthern crock in which a little water has first been poured Make deep holes with the thumb and pour water into them Cover with a damp cloth and then with the earthen top When the clay dries out so much that it is difficult to mould let it dry thoroughly and pound it to a powder on a strong bench or table with an old flat iron It may then be re mixed as already described When ready to begin work take a good sized lump of clay say about ten pounds pound and knead it upon a table Then draw a strong wire through it at the middle dividing it in halves Press the two outer surfaces together kneading out the air holes which will be found on the inner surfaces This process repeated a number of times will finally expel all the air bubbles and leave the clay in good condition for moulding Clay that is to be used on the wheel will need to be much more thoroughly kneaded than that for hand moulded or built pottery Tools Illustration FIG to Boxwood modelling tools Boxwood modelling tools are useful for the hand moulded pottery and for decoration One pointed tool like a sharpened pencil see Fig and another double ended one with points that are more flattened and rounded see Fig will be enough to start with One should also have a double ended steel tool with pointed knife ends see Fig for incising and other decorative work A steel tool with narrow flattened ends see Fig is necessary for cutting away the background to leave the design in low relief Illustration FIG Illustration FIG Illustration FIG The tools for use with the potter s wheel are mostly of thin steel and may easily be cut from a sheet of steel which one can buy of a dealer in hardware There should be an oval shape two and a quarter by four inches and another of the same size and shape with the edges cut in saw teeth see Fig There should also be a tool with one straight side and the other curved see Fig and a rectangular one about two by four inches A hoe shaped tool of steel see Fig is indispensable for working on the wheel as is a slender point of steel an inch and a quarter long set in a wooden handle see Fig and a piece of stout wire A rubber polisher the size and shape of the oval tool of sheet steel will also be found useful These may be bought of dealers in potters tools A sponge a ground glass slab about a foot square a rolling pin and sandpaper are also essential Illustration FIG Round and square slabs of plaster of paris should be provided upon which to put the pieces of pottery while they are being formed These may be bought or cast in moulds according to the directions in Chapter VII Hand made Pottery CHAPTER II HAND MADE POTTERY It is quite important that the potter should have a workshop be it ever so small which clay dust and water will not harm A light dry cellar is a good place or an outbuilding if one lives in the country The sense of freedom which comes from working in this way is a help in accomplishing good results Protected by a long sleeved apron and in such a place one need not have a care for clothes or carpets A stout old table one or two chairs and possibly a shelf upon which to put the finished pottery with these and the potter s wheel and bench see Chapter III one will be well equipped This is taking for granted that one has been able to buy one s clay ready mixed Otherwise there must be a tub for mixing the clay and a sieve see Chapter I In addition to the clay and the tools already mentioned in Chapter I a pitcher of water will be needed and a bowl for the slip or clay thinned with water to the consistency of very thick cream The potter is now ready for work Illustration FIG Small pieces of pottery such as dishes and candlesticks may be moulded with the hands from a single piece of clay see Chapter VI but for larger pieces the strong and simple Indian process of building up with coils of clay is more satisfactory This may be done in a variety of ways Either the piece is formed by coiling the strips of clay within a mould as described in Chapters VI and VII or by building it up by eye assisted by a cardboard outline see plate or it may be formed entirely by eye like the rose bowl with a moth design in Chapter VI The first method while it is the simplest is not the best to begin with for one relies too much upon the mould and unconsciously uses it too often instead of training one s eye to make a true and beautiful form The second method testing the form with a pasteboard outline as the piece is built will be the best to start with Having decided upon the shape he wishes to make the potter draws it in outline natural size upon a piece of cardboard It will be wise to choose a form as nearly like a cylinder as possible for example a jar for flowers The outline sketch is divided by a vertical line ruled exactly through its centre Another straight line parallel with the first is drawn three inches to the right of it The outline is then cut out see Fig so as to make a guide for the contour of the jar A flat round piece of clay about five inches in diameter and half an inch thick is now moulded and placed in the centre of a plaster tile In the middle of this piece a circle two and three quarters inches in diameter is drawn with a tool A lump of clay which has been well worked to get out all air holes is rolled on the table with the palms of the hands near the base of the thumb lightly yet with sufficient push to make the clay revolve wholly each time If the roll flattens from too hard pressure pat it into circular form and continue to roll it until it is of even thickness about an inch in diameter It is then flattened evenly one end is cut into a long point and the coil is started on edge narrow side up on the circle drawn upon the clay bottom which has previously had lines criss crossed upon it back and forth with a steel tool to insure the first coil s clinging to it To make this even more certain a touch of slip is brushed lightly here and there over the edge of the circle While the thumb and middle finger on either side of the coil support it the forefinger presses it down firmly on to the bottom all the way around see plate It is so much easier to flare the walls of one s piece than to make them straight or bring them in that they should be kept as nearly vertical as possible especially in starting When the circuit has been made cut the end of the clay strip into a long flat point which will fit evenly in with the one at the beginning of the coil and press the edges together with the flat of the nail of finger or thumb This is also done where the edges of the coil come against the bottom outside and in Quick firm yet short strokes of the nail up and down join the edges In putting on the second row no marking with the tool is necessary only to brush it with slip After the second row is added the jar is put out in the air for half an hour or so until it has stiffened a little This is supposing that the potter is working at a time when the clay will not freeze When the weather is cold the piece must be left to stiffen indoors as pottery that has once frozen is useless The inside of the bottom and walls are then smoothed with great care for as it is to be a tall jar this must be done before the walls get too high Two more rows of coiling are now added as before testing the shape by pressing the cardboard outline close against it all around the circumference After this the jar is again put out in the air for half an hour or so This method is continued until the jar is built up Illustration BUILDING A PIECE OF POTTERY Making the First Coil Testing the Outline Continuing the Piece Should the walls become weak and insecure from working them too rapidly let them dry for a longer time several hours or over night before finishing Test the shape constantly with the cardboard outline When the jar is as high as the drawing or even a quarter to half an inch higher let it dry over night It should then be smoothed with an oval steel tool which has a saw toothed edge see Fig to take the worst unevenness off The tool is bent to fit the shape of the jar and held at right angles with it smoothing it with short strokes in different directions This is done inside and out The hollows are also filled in To do this wet the spot first with slip and fill in with clay as nearly the consistency of that in the jar as possible The sides are then made perfectly even with the oval tool with smooth edges holding it as the saw toothed tool was held When there are no hollows or ridges and the walls are about a quarter of an inch thick the surface of the jar is smoothed with a damp sponge and polished with the fingers and thumb inside and out taking care in handling it not to hold it by the edge but rest it in the hollowed hand Should it have become very dry as it will in a comparatively short time in warm weather so that it is light gray in colour it will be wise to smooth it with sandpaper instead of with the sponge as in this state even a little water may cause it to crack One cannot learn too soon or have too often impressed upon one s mind the risk of adding wet clay to a piece of pottery that is much drier The natural shrinkage which has already taken place in the dry clay will be repeated in the wet and as it shrinks it will crack the drier clay Cracks in clay are of two kinds those caused by shrinkage of the unbaked or green clay and those that come from cooling too rapidly in the biscuit or baked clay The former can usually be mended satisfactorily but for the latter there is no remedy the piece is spoiled To mend a crack in clay that is only partially dry put a little slip into the crack and then work in with a modelling tool clay of the consistency of the piece If after drying longer the piece cracks again a long deep crack that goes through to the inside there is no way to mend it except by cutting the clay out on either side for quite a space beyond the crack brushing both sides with slip and filling in with clay as nearly as possible the consistency of the piece This is pressed in in small bits little by little until the gap is filled If it should crack again in small short places fill them with dry powdered clay pressed in and moulded with a steel tool In case of the piece cracking when it is bone dry that is after it has dried for several days and is pale gray in colour grind some pieces of baked clay to a fine powder add enough water to make a soft yellow paste and fill the cracks with it The edge of the jar is cut as even as possible with a tool and then made perfectly true by the following method A little water is poured on a ground glass slab and the jar held bottom up is moved firmly but rapidly round and round on the wet surface and then quickly taken up by sliding it off at the edge of the slab before it clings to the glass The bottom must now be finished The jar is first placed bottom up on a slab or table then a circle is drawn with a pencil at about half an inch from the edge of the bottom This is outlined with the pointed steel tool and the bottom within the circle is evenly and carefully cut out with strokes of the oval smooth edged tool so that the outside ring shall form a ridge not over one sixteenth of an inch above the depressed interior of the circle The potter now cuts his initial or mark which is made in as simple lines as possible into the bottom with firm deep strokes If the jar is not very dry a wooden modelling tool may be used for this Otherwise the pointed steel tool is chosen Care should be taken not to cut under the edge in making these incised lines The edges should instead be bevelled so that when the glaze is put on it will flow more freely over them If possible this jar being large should be fired in the biscuit that is before it is glazed and then again after it has been glazed unless one is obliged to send it a long distance to be fired so that more than one firing is impracticable in which case it must of course be glazed on the unbaked clay A pale green glaze see directions in Chapter V will complete it In packing to send pieces to a far off kiln by express use a wooden box and after lining it with newspaper wrap the pieces in soft paper and pack them carefully in sawdust Working on the Wheel CHAPTER III WORKING ON THE WHEEL Illustration FIG From Encyclopedia Britannica That the primitive potter did not mould his pottery on a wheel we can be reasonably sure The Egyptians however as early as B C used the simplest potter s wheel as is proved by fragments of pottery still in existence This wheel was a small round table revolving on a pivot see Fig The potter set it in motion with his hand and from time to time gave it a spin to keep it revolving The same wheel is used to this day in many parts of India An improvement on this simple contrivance was made in Egypt under the Ptolemies A larger circular table was fixed lower down on the same axis This the potter set and kept in motion with his foot leaving his hands free at all times to mould the clay while the wheel was kept at a regular speed What is technically known as throwing or moulding pottery on the wheel is a process that is not learned in a moment or even in a day It takes time and patience but it is certainly one of the most fascinating parts of the craft One would have lost half of the charm of pottery making who had not felt the plastic clay on the potter s wheel rise and fall between his hands almost as if endowed with life The rapidity with which pieces can be formed on the wheel is an advantage over other processes while the regularity of shape refinement and perfection of finish give wheel made pottery a beauty all its own Until lately few women potters have worked on the wheel because the ordinary form of potter s wheel which was turned with one foot the potter standing on the other made the work too difficult and laborious for a woman to attempt Now however a wheel copied from an old French model is in use which enables the potter to sit while at work This is the wheel shown in Fig It is obtainable from makers of potters tools The cost of such a wheel with an iron top and shaft and wooden flywheel made of three thicknesses of boards is eighteen dollars but second hand wheels can sometimes be bought for much less When the wheel is set up the shaft box a square box below the upper wheel is fastened to the edge of a strong table or shelf which has been placed in a good light A seat which slants forward not unlike a reading desk in form is made of wood see Fig and set up near enough to the wheel for a person sitting on it to reach the wheel comfortably It is braced by a board on either side extending diagonally forward from the leg of the seat to the floor and by a board fastened on the right of the top of the seat and reaching to the table Under the table a foot rest roughly made of boards is needed Illustration FIG At first it will be wise to learn how to set the wheel in motion Suppose we practice this a few times before beginning to mould When one is seated on the inclined bench the left foot on the rest the right foot starting just below the body near the outer edge of the wheel swings the flywheel from right to left The point of the foot is used for this Four or five vigorous turns are given and then the foot swinging nearer the iron shaft gives five or six more pushes to the flywheel and is placed on the foot rest Expert potters can turn with the foot while the hands are busy moulding but we who are beginners will do wisely to start the wheel revolving then keeping both feet on the rest give all our attention to the hand work until the slower revolutions warn us that it is time to give the wheel another start One caution should be given and it may not be out of place here Do not work too long a time at the wheel Half or three quarters of an hour s steady work at a time will be enough After that leave it for half an hour and you will not get physically or nervously tired besides the work will go much better Have your tools and a bowl of thin slip within easy reach as you sit at the wheel In beginning your piece a lump of clay say about two pounds well worked is made into a ball Wet the top of the wheel then rub it off so as to leave the wheel just moist enough for the clay to stick but not slippery so that it will slide The lump of clay held in both hands is then thrown firmly on to the centre of the wheel The bottom of the lump should be well down on the wheel and it is most important to have it exactly in the centre The hands are wet with slip which is also rubbed over the lump of clay with both hands so that it is thoroughly moist The wheel is now set in motion as already described and when it is well started and both feet are up on the rest the hands held one on either side of the clay starting close to the wheel move slowly up the sides of the lump drawing it up into a cone shape The elbows should be well braced against the sides of the body so as to hold the hands absolutely steady for they should never waver or swing with the wheel but hold true and firm If the mass is not exactly in the centre of the wheel or the cone shape is not even the hands are again wet with slip a few drops of which are shaken on to the clay The thumbs are laid together and the hands at the bases of the thumbs are pressed firmly down on the clay as the wheel turns pressing it again into mound shape The hands and clay are wet once more and the wheel started The clay is now pressed up again into the cone form taking great care to have the pressure even and slow The hands should move after each revolution not more than a quarter of an inch When a good cone shape is made exactly in the middle of the wheel the piece is centred In order to prove that the cone is absolutely in the centre set the wheel going brace the arms against the body and steadying the right hand with the left move the forefinger of the right closer and closer to the cone until it all but touches it If the figure hits in any one place that will prove that the cone is not centred and it must be pressed again into mound shape as already described but if it just clears it all the way round the potter proceeds to the next step The thumbs held close together above the clay are aimed at the exact centre of it and their ends pressed firmly but lightly in while the wheel revolves once or twice This is to mark the centre The next step is to hollow out the piece This is also done with the thumbs The hands and clay being wet with slip and the wheel started well the fingers inclose the outer walls of the piece while the thumbs are pressed into the centre of the clay firmly and decidedly down to within less than half an inch from the bottom This is something that the potter learns to know almost by instinct how close he can come to the top of the wheel and yet leave a bottom thick enough to trim and finish Illustration FIG Two handled conical jar Illustration FIG A form as nearly cylindrical as possible will be the simplest to begin with Suppose one wishes to make a jar of the shape shown in Fig The next step is to make the walls of equal thickness hollowing the bottom more To do this the elbows are braced against the sides and the fingers placed in the position shown in Fig This is one of the ways in which the hands are made to support each other and work in unison The different placings of the hands to accomplish various results are known as potter s grips In this one the right hand which remains outside the piece lying close against it supports the left by the thumb which rests against it the forefinger of the right hand having previously been coiled around its thumb see Fig The middle finger of the left hand lies against the wall of the piece inside The piece is thus supported outside and in by a hand Illustration FIG Starting at the bottom as the wheel turns the hands held steady and firm rise slowly with each revolution of the wheel The right presses more than the left hollowing the bottom and walls of the piece Slowly slowly the hands rise until the top is reached If the shape is not quite true the hands start in the same position at the bottom and again go up pressing hardest when pressure is needed and going lightly where it is not necessary to alter the shape Another position of the hands see Fig may be used to press the clay into a narrower form This must be done with great deliberation and care however as too much pressure may make a crease in the clay wall which will spoil the piece When the walls are of even thickness not more than a quarter of an inch and the shape about what one wishes the top must be finished First the edge is cut even We will use for this the tool shown in Fig Illustration FIG Holding the tool which has been wet with slip firmly in the right hand brace the left by resting the thumb near where the steel is inserted in the wood see Fig As the wheel turns lay the left forefinger wet with slip just inside the top of the piece and directly opposite at the point where one wishes to cut the top run the point of the tool through till it touches the finger and hold it steady and firm till one revolution of the wheel has been made The wheel is then stopped and the edge that was cut lifted off deftly and quickly Illustration FIG To soften the edge hold the forefinger and middle finger of the right hand apart see Fig Wet their inner surfaces thoroughly with slip then as the wheel revolves hold them straight and firm while the left hand steadies the wrist of the right and press the rounded joining of the two fingers gently but firmly down on the top of the piece holding it there steadily till one or two whole revolutions of the wheel have been made If one wishes to have a more flaring top lay the forefinger of the right hand inside the edge with ever so slight an outward pressure while the wheel turns once Before perfecting the bottom it may be as well to let the piece stiffen for half an hour The hoe shaped tool is used for cutting away the extra clay under the bottom Set the wheel in motion then take the tool well moistened with slip in the left hand Hold it firmly with its long edge on the top of the wheel if it is to be a long and gradual slope into the bottom of the jar while the right hand steadies the top outer angle of the tool It is then run in under the bottom and there held till one or more revolutions have cut away the surplus clay Should one wish to make a more abrupt line up from the bottom the process is reversed the right hand holds the tool the short side of which is laid on the wheel while the left hand holds the outside top angle to steady it After an hour or two when the piece has stiffened somewhat it may be smoothed and the form refined or improved if necessary with the smooth edged oval tool of sheet steel When the wheel is in motion this tool moistened with water and bent to fit the curves of the piece is held in the right hand at right angles with the piece while the left hand supports the wrist of the right Too abrupt angles may be softened and roughness removed with this tool Start at the bottom with it and move it up gradually with each revolution of the wheel lightly except where the form needs much trimming The rubber polisher wet with water is now passed over the surface in the same way taking care that it is held at right angles with the piece and the hand that holds it is braced by the other A stout wire held close to the piece on either side is then drawn under it once or twice to prevent its clinging to the wheel The next day or as soon as the piece is stiff it is removed to a plaster tile In finishing the bottom the wheel is first scraped and wiped clean of all clay the piece is then placed on it bottom up and centred This is done by putting it as near the middle as possible by eye then when the wheel is going well hold the right forefinger or a wooden tool well braced close to the piece See if it touches at any point and if so move that side nearer the centre Roll four short pieces of rather stiff clay With two of these make supports on the wheel about an inch high close to the piece on either side to hold it steady not close enough to cling to it Two more supports are placed half way between the first two Get the wheel going well and holding the hoe shaped tool so that its middle angle will strike the bottom of the piece about half an inch from the edge aim it truly and hold it steadily till the wheel has made one or more revolutions which will mark a circle Within this line depress the bottom slightly by cutting out a thin layer of clay This is done with the rectangular sheet steel tool held first near the line then with each revolution nearer the centre till it reaches it The potter next cuts his mark on the bottom with a wooden tool if the piece is not very dry otherwise it should be made with a pointed steel tool taking care to bevel the edges of the incised lines Illustration WORKING ON THE WHEEL On the left is a pale green bowl for flowers beside it a cream jug with a gray green mat glaze The flower jar with two handles is also gray green and the nasturtium bowl on the right has a dull blue mat glaze Illustration METHODS OF DECORATION The large fruit bowl on the left has an incised design of orange leaves near the rim Beside it is a low dish for candy with a built up decoration of rings A design of maple leaves is incised on the other small dish and the lamp bowl at the right of the plate has a pierced decoration Illustration FIG Illustration FIG Illustration FIG The jar is finished with a handle on each side Roll out two strips of clay five and a half inches long flatten them and trim the edges Now mark a place on each side of the top of the jar so that a line drawn from one to the other would exactly divide the top Make two other marks in the same way at the bottom directly under those at the top These are for guides in attaching the handles Starting at the top below one of the marks criss cross lines with the steel tool for an inch down the side of the jar Do this on the other side of the jar and then starting an inch above the mark on either side of the bottom cut criss cross lines for an inch up the side of the jar Now take one of the clay strips brush the upper criss crossed lines on one side of the jar with slip and press the end of the strip upon it working the edges close against the side of the jar with the flat of the nail The other end of the strip is cut in a long point to fit the form of the jar and bent into the shape shown in the plate Wet the criss crossed lines below it with slip and attach this end in the same way as the first The other handle is put on in the same manner A mat glaze of gray green see Chapter V will complete the piece Such forms as are shown in Figs and can be made without any difficulty and they will be most attractive for short stemmed flowers violets sweet peas or nasturtiums A cream jug see plate is comparatively simple The lip is formed with a deft touch of the finger after the piece is moulded and the handle added afterward A dull green mat glaze will make a charming finish for this piece The jar shown in Fig is more difficult to shape but it is an excellent one for flowers Methods of Decoration CHAPTER IV METHODS OF DECORATION The more simple and strong pottery designs are the better Those that are intricate no matter how beautiful are out of place on the big substantial forms while delicate traceries are lost under the glaze Here as in basketry we can learn much from the work of primitive peoples In applying such designs simple methods too are best incising building up the outline so that the design shall be raised above the background cutting away the background to leave the design in low relief and piercing These are good processes easy to learn and effective in result In starting suppose we decorate a wheel made piece a low dish for candy with a built up design of rings Dish for Candy with Ring Design Materials required A wheel made dish or bowl Ultramarine blue water colour paint A small water colour paint brush with a fine point A saucer of ground baked clay mixed with water A pitcher of water The low bowl shown in the plate is not difficult to mould on the wheel After it has become bone dry as it will in three or four days it will be safe to decorate it in this way Be careful in handling the piece not to grasp it by the edge which in all unbaked pottery but especially in that that is bone dry is the most fragile part It should be held in the hollow of the left hand while the right does the work Have ready some ultramarine blue water colour paint mixed with water in a cup a small paint brush tapering to a fine point and a saucer in which is some baked or biscuit clay pale yellow in colour ground fine and mixed with water to the consistency of thick cream A jug of water nearby is also necessary to thin the clay mixture when it stiffens The design chosen is one large and two small rings alternating around the bowl near the top see Fig First measure the circumference of the top of the bowl Divide it into fifths and mark the divisions with the paint brush and blue paint Starting a quarter of an inch below one of these marks draw a small ring about half an inch in diameter with the blue paint Should you make a mistake the paint will erase easily after it is dry Illustration FIG Half an inch below the first ring another is drawn One of these groups of two small rings is made below each of the five marks around the top of the bowl Then starting half an inch below the top of the bowl and midway between two groups draw a larger ring about an inch in diameter One of these rings is outlined in the same way in each of the five spaces When the design is perfected and the paint dry dilute a little of the baked clay in the saucer to the consistency of thin cream and with it and the brush thoroughly cleansed from blue paint trace the outlines of the decoration Use a full brush and make the lines as uniform as possible in width and thickness There should be four or more coats of this material applied in order to build up the design sufficiently but only the first one is thin This is so that it shall cling to the clay underneath The next and subsequent coats are made with a thicker consistency of the creamy mixture which must however be thin enough to flow freely from the brush Do not add a coat until the one underneath is thoroughly dry The piece is now ready for glazing A pale green glaze may be used see Chapter V Illustration FIG Incising is an absolutely simple process which gives a charming effect Examples of this method of decoration are shown in the fruit bowl with a garland of orange leaves just below the rim on the inside see plate and Fig and the smaller bowl with a maple seed design see plate and Fig Incising also helps the pierced design on the rose bowl described in Chapter VII To Decorate a Small Bowl with Incised Design of Maple Seeds Materials required A small wheel made bowl A pointed steel tool A pointed boxwood tool A boxwood tool with curved point The bowl a low one is made on the wheel according to the directions in Chapter III After it has dried for a day it may be decorated with an incised design Suppose we choose for this a winged maple seed the simple outlines of which any one can draw From tip to tip of the wings should measure at least an inch and three quarters If the bowl is small not more than four and a half inches in diameter at the top six seeds should be made at equal distances around it First measure the circumference of the top of the bowl Divide it into sixths and with a pencil mark off as many divisions on the edge of the bowl The design which is drawn so that the seed portion is down and the little wings turn up is first outlined in pencil near the top of the bowl Begin by drawing the seed part which should be about an inch below a pencil mark on the edge With a boxwood point deepen the line and then make the incision still deeper using the wooden tool with a curved point Take care not to make a double line in deepening the first outline it should be a clean firm line with a bevelled edge Avoid cutting under the edge as the glaze will not run smoothly over it If the piece is too dry to admit of incising with a wooden tool use a pointed steel tool at first and finish with a wooden one Certain parts of the design should be accented by deepening the line for example the rounded seed portion particularly where it joins the wings This bowl may be finished with a pale green mat glaze see Chapter V or with a soft brown one A decoration that is left in low relief by cutting away the background is admirable for some pieces The moth design on the rose bowl in Chapter VI is made in this way The design is first drawn on the piece in pencil Next it is outlined with firm sure strokes using a pointed steel tool and taking great care not to cut under the edge of the outline but bevel it as in other processes Go over the whole outline of the design again with a boxwood point making the lines deeper Then start close to the edge of the outline with the steel tool which has a flat point and scrape away from it cutting as deep as the outline close to the design and sloping gradually up to nothing at about half an inch from it Certain parts of the design may be emphasised by cutting the outline somewhat deeper at those points Be sure to cut away enough clay about the design to leave it in decided relief for the glaze softens the edges and makes them too indefinite if they are not firm and clear in the beginning Illustration FIG Pierced decorations are particularly good on pottery Such simple designs as those in Figs and will be found the most satisfactory Illustration FIG In planning a pierced decoration for the top of a piece take care not to start it too close to the rim three quarters of an inch or more should be left between the edge and the decoration otherwise the piercing will weaken the piece Outline the design first in pencil then with firm clear strokes follow the line with the pointed steel tool The line is traced a second time still more deeply All the clay within the outlines is cut out as far as the incision has been made and then the sharp point of the tool is run through the wall close to the line While the clay is being cut away with the right hand the left supports the inner wall of the piece Illustration FIG When the whole design has been pierced moisten the finger with water and soften the edges of the decoration that the glaze may flow freely over it Decorations in high relief are made as follows Small lumps of clay as nearly as possible the consistency of the piece of pottery are applied to the portions which are to be decorated and which have previously been criss crossed with a steel tool and wet with slip The design is then moulded with the hands and wooden modelling tools working the edges close on to the surface of the piece The Glaze and How to Apply It CHAPTER V THE GLAZE AND HOW TO APPLY IT Clay that is simply baked without a glazed coating will not hold water perfectly One can imagine what a blow it must have been to the early potter when he found that this was the case Some say that he used wax at first to close the pores of his pottery and later perhaps by the overheating of a kiln glazed pottery was discovered Pottery that is soft will develop a semi glazed surface when overfired and it is probable that some such accident suggested the use of the glaze The first glaze was doubtless a pure silicate of soda Oxide of lead added to this made it more fusible but it was not as hard or durable What is known as biscuit is baked clay porous and without gloss for example a flower pot Glossy pottery has a very thin layer of glaze upon it The Samian ware of the Greeks furnishes examples of this finish Glazed pottery is covered with a perceptible coating of glass Enamelled ware or pottery with a mat glaze has a glazed coating made opaque with oxide of tin This finish is used on some of the most beautiful art pottery Glazes may be coloured with certain metallic oxides without losing their transparency One is often confused by hearing the terms enamel and glaze carelessly used Enamel should be used to describe a vitreous coating that is opaque and glaze a glossy transparent surface both may be coloured The term mat glaze is an exception to this rule This means an opaque glaze with a glossy finish The materials of which glazes are composed are about the same as those that enter into the composition of clays with a few additions There is in glazes as in clays the play of soft and hard materials or the flux and frit Flint aluminum or china clay forms the frit or hard refractory portion potash soda lead or borax the melting part or flux The addition of clays gives durability In preparing the flux it is melted like glass and then crushed to powder The frit must first be melted then dropped from the crucible into water before it can be powdered The making of glazes is not often done by amateurs and unless one is planning to start pottery making as a business and requires large quantities of glazes it is best to buy them from a reliable dealer They come in the form of powder soft glaze hard glaze and stannif re which is a hard glaze with some oxide of tin added to make it opaque The soft glazes are used on ware which fires at a low heat and is therefore not durable A large proportion of hard glaze must be added to make the preparation applicable to a pottery which is fired at an intense heat while if one wishes a mat glaze the stannif re is also used The colouring materials may be bought of the same dealer They are as follows Antimony for yellow cobalt for blue copper for green chrome for green manganese for brown and iron for brown Red oxide of iron colours a purplish red and carbonate of copper makes a gray green that is very beautiful A ground glass or stone slab on which to mix the glaze and a palette knife will be required also a small quantity of gum arabic and of gum tragacanth a small teacup and a measuring glass These with two or three soft paint brushes of various sizes one that is an inch wide one smaller and another larger will be enough of an outfit to start with The gum arabic should be dissolved in water to the consistency of honey It is used in the first coat of glaze to bind the glaze and prevent it from rubbing off Quite a little of it may be prepared at a time and kept in a covered glass jar until needed The gum tragacanth is bought in small quantities five cents worth at a time Cover this amount with one pint of water and let it stand over night In the morning strain it through a fine sieve and put it away in a glass jar till it is needed If possible very large pieces of pottery should be fired before they are glazed in the biscuit as it is called Small and medium sized pieces may be glazed on the green clay the term by which unbaked clay is known among potters The piece should have dried thoroughly for several days until it is light gray in colour and what is known as bone dry It is decorated if decoration is required and then glazed All vessels that are used to hold or measure glaze should first be dipped in water to prevent waste from the glaze clinging to them The hands should be washed thoroughly after working with glazes as some of the materials used are poisonous For the inside of most pieces a transparent glaze is used whether the outer glaze is to be transparent or opaque All of the odds and ends of transparent glaze no matter what the colour that are left after each glazing are poured into a large bowl or other vessel which is kept for the purpose The mixture of all colours in this combination of glazes makes a neutral tint which harmonizes most agreeably with the outer glaze whatever its colour It is applied as follows To Glaze the Inside of a Piece of Pottery Take a small cupful of transparent glaze and holding the piece of pottery over the large vessel containing the liquid pour the cupful of glaze into it rolling it around the inside of the piece quickly but carefully so as to have it cover the entire inner surface Then turn the piece deftly and suddenly bottom up so as to empty it into the large vessel without letting any of it drip over onto the outside of the piece Should this happen by accident rub it quickly off with the fingers The Outside Glaze and How to Apply It The most satisfactory finish for the outside of fine pottery is a mat or opaque glaze in any soft dull shade of green brown blue yellow or the red obtainable with red oxide of iron For an art pottery composed of fire and blue clay which requires a strong heat the following glaze is applicable Gray Green Mat Glaze Mix tablespoonful of soft glaze tablespoonful of stannif re and tablespoonful of China clay together on a stone or glass slab with a palette knife adding teaspoonful of gum arabic and enough water to make the consistency a little thicker than thick cream About teaspoonful of carbonate of copper added to this mixture and ground thoroughly into it with the palette knife will make a light gray green For deeper shades increase the quantity slightly The tint appears much lighter than it will when fired indeed in the colouring of glazes as in painting on china the worker needs a great deal of faith for until the magic of the kiln brings out the colours one would never guess what they were to be In applying the glaze place your piece bottom up on a table or other flat surface Dip a soft flat paint brush into the bowl of glaze and beginning with the bottom paint it on in short strokes in every direction what an artist would call cross hatching and overlapping slightly like the shingles on a house The bottom receives but one coat of glaze as it is liable to stick in firing and be uneven if it has more than one Next start at the sides near the bottom as the piece stands upside down and paint down for an inch or two all around The piece is then set right side up providing of course that the bottom is dry which it will be undoubtedly and the rest of it is glazed From time to time stir up the glaze from the bottom that it may be thoroughly mixed The edge especially should be carefully covered and the outer glaze may even be brought over inside the piece a little Before applying the second and third coats for the piece receives three two teaspoonfuls of gum tragacanth well mixed according to directions are added to the glaze In putting on the second coat the piece is again placed upside down on the table and beginning where the sides join the bottom the glaze is applied as before The sides and top edge only are glazed this time The third coat which is put on when the second is dry is begun at the top edge covering it well and is ended gradually and unevenly half way down the sides Pale green Mat Glaze To make a lighter shade of green with just a hint of yellow to soften it add to half the quantity of the glaze first mixed as much again of the uncoloured glaze and a slight sprinkling of yellow It will be seen from these directions how much the colouring of glazes is like the blending of pigments for a picture It is a delightful field for experiment and the element of chance is supplied by the kiln which often does unexpected and interesting things to one s colours and glazes leaving here a touch of brown about the rim to relieve an expanse of green there a metallic tinge almost like lustre and again the biscuit peeps through the glaze giving a warmer tone to the edge of a decoration In mixing the glaze for a piece that has been fired in the biscuit make it a little thicker than that for use on the green clay about the consistency of whipped cream It is applied somewhat differently too A potter would tell you to rag it on that is put it on with firm short strokes using the ends of the hairs of the brush instead of the flat part Let each coat dry well before the next is applied Three or four coats will be necessary except for the bottom which receives but one After the first coat gum tragacanth is added as in glazing on green clay The fourth coat need not entirely cover the piece but the top should be carefully glazed If for any reason the pottery has to be re fired it should be reglazed but two coats only will be necessary and the glaze need not be quite so heavy as that used on the biscuit Do not be discouraged if your pieces need a second or even a third firing for often the most beautiful results are obtained by re firing Quality that combination of richness and depth of colour and texture rarely comes with the first firing Pottery for Beauty and Use CHAPTER VI POTTERY FOR BEAUTY AND USE When one thinks of the limitless possibilities of pottery in household decoration the great dishes for flowers and fruit the lamp bowls candlesticks and tiles one may make one can hardly wait to begin Now is the chance to work out a long treasured idea for a match bowl or a plant jar to hang against the wall or window frame Now one can show the superiority of one s conceptions over the stupid things in shops Let us hasten to get out the clay and begin Dark Green Fruit Bowl Materials required About pounds of clay A plaster mould for a bowl or inches in diameter at the top The oval tools of sheet steel The wooden modelling tools The pointed steel tool A flint bag A rolling pin A bowl of slip A small sponge Take a good lump of clay about four and a half pounds well worked and free from air bubbles Beat out a piece with the flat of the hand on a table until it is about three quarters of an inch thick and more than large enough to cover the bottom of the plaster mould you have chosen It should be of even thickness and may be rolled with a rolling pin to make it smooth Be sure that the plaster mould is clean and free from scraps of clay Then dust it with powdered flint tied up in a cotton cloth Now fit the flat piece of clay carefully into the bottom of the bowl mould pressing it firmly but lightly against it Cut the edge evenly around Next a long rope of clay is rolled as described in Chapter II It should be an inch in diameter and long enough to go around the bowl just above the bottom Pat it flat and even and cut one end into a long point After cross cutting the edge of the bottom piece to insure its holding firmly to the coil above brush it with slip and lay the coil along pressing it firmly on to the edge of the bottom piece Work the edges of this piece and the coil together with firm short strokes of the flat part of the thumb or forefinger nail Where the coil joins the other end it is cut into a long flat point that will fit exactly the point at the beginning completing the row Illustration WHERE USE AND BEAUTY ARE COMBINED For the next coil no cross cutting with the tool is necessary but otherwise the process is the same in joining this and subsequent coils Care should be taken to press the clay firmly against the walls of the mould as well as upon the coil below When the inside of the mould is covered if a deeper bowl is desired add one or two more coils above the edge taking care to have them slope in such a way as to continue the lines of the bowl It is then set away to harden The next day the clay will have dried and shrunk sufficiently to come easily away from the plaster The bowl is then placed bottom up on a table or flat slab and the hollows left between the coils on the outside are wet with slip and filled in evenly with clay of the consistency of that in the piece This will take time and care The bowl is then allowed to dry for an hour or two Next it is carefully scraped and made even first with the oval steel tool with a saw edge held at right angles with the bowl and curved to fit the form this is to get the large bumps off It is then carefully evened off with the smooth edged oval tool bent to fit the curves of the bowl The inside is made smooth and even in the same way brushing any deep hollows with slip and filling them in with clay This process should be carefully and conscientiously done so that the walls of the bowl as one feels them between finger and thumb are even and free from lumps They should not be more than a quarter of an inch thick A damp sponge is then passed over the bowl and the fingers and thumb smooth and polish it outside and in The edge is trimmed as evenly as possible by eye with a steel tool and then bevelled as follows Illustration FIG On a large slab of ground glass pour a little water which should be spread over the glass till it is thoroughly wet Now holding the bowl bottom up firmly with both hands press its edge quickly and with a circular motion flat on the glass It must be done so rapidly and deftly that it will not stick but makes the edge even and true Slip it off at the side of the slab instead of lifting it up from the centre The bottom is finished as described in Chapter II If this is done in the morning the bowl will be ready for the decoration in the afternoon This is a band of orange leaves see Fig deeply incised near the top of the bowl on the inside see Chapter IV More character will be given to the design if the line is broad and deep particularly at the points of the leaves which are thus emphasised This piece being so large should if possible be fired in the biscuit and then finished inside and out with a dark green mat glaze see Chapter V and fired again Candlestick Thumb Design Materials required About pounds of clay The boxwood modelling tools The pointed steel tool A plaster slab A small sponge This sturdy little candlestick shows that it is hand moulded by the marks of the potter s thumb on base handle and candle cup The square base is moulded from a single large piece of clay This is patted flat and even with the thick part of the hand and then cut square and the sides turned up for about an inch making the base about five inches square and three eighths of an inch thick It is then placed on a plaster slab and the corners are pressed in with a firmly held thumb The sides of the square base are moulded into a gradual inward curve and the corners are slightly depressed see plate A cup for the candle see Fig is made by rolling a piece of clay into cylindrical form about an inch and three quarters in diameter and two inches and a quarter long At the top of this roll the finger makes a hollow for the candle It should be remembered that the clay shrinks both in drying and firing so this hole should be a trifle large and deep for the candle The sides of the cup at about an inch from the top are squared and pressed in so that the four corners will stand out like columns The hollowed sides between the corners show the mark of the thumb see Fig The centre of the base is now wet with thick slip and the candle cup pressed firmly on to it while the edges are moulded closely on to the base Illustration FIG A piece of clay is then rolled and flattened into a handle an inch in diameter and five inches long This is put on at one corner of the base and is not attached at any other point Before moulding it on to the base touch the corner lightly with thick slip to insure its holding Where the handle joins the base it is made thick and substantial by adding a little extra clay The print of the thumb is made where the handle joins the corner another is pressed on the top and another still on the end of the handle see plate and Fig To support the handle until it dries roll a ball of soft paper under it After the candlestick has stood for a few hours out of doors or indoors overnight it is carefully trimmed with one of the wooden tools or the sharp pointed metal one taking care to leave sufficient thickness to give it a sturdy substantial character yet not enough to make it clumsy It is then rubbed over with a damp sponge and polished with the thumb and finger which will smooth away any lumps and give the piece a hand moulded look Should there be any very deep hollows to make it uneven they should be wet with slip very slightly and filled in with clay as nearly the consistency of that in the candlestick as possible When it is bone dry it will be ready for the glaze see Chapter V Illustration FIG Bowl for a Lamp Materials required About pounds of clay A plaster mould for a bowl The wooden modelling tools The oval sheet steel tools The pointed steel tool A rolling pin A flint bag A small sponge Having chosen a good mould for your bowl brush it inside with ground flint tied in a cotton cloth so that the clay will not stick to it Now beat out a piece of well worked clay on a board with the flat of the hand until it is perhaps two inches more in diameter than the bottom of the mould and half an inch thick It should be rolled smooth with the rolling pin Lay it in the mould pressing it firmly against the bottom and sides It may not be out of place here to say that no tool but a wooden one should be used in working in moulds as metal tools are liable to injure the plaster The edge of the bottom piece is next cut even with a wooden modelling tool and a lump of clay is formed into a rude cube shape between the hands and then rolled out on a table or board with the flat of the hand till about three quarters of an inch in diameter This roll of clay is flattened evenly for its whole length The top edge of the bottom piece is marked with criss cross lines and wet with slip The roll of clay is then started on edge along the top of the bottom piece pressed firmly down upon it and against the sides of the mould It is joined to the bottom with firm even strokes of the thumb or forefinger nail When the circuit has been made the two ends each cut in a long flat point so that they will unite perfectly are joined Another roll is now made the upper edge of the previous coil is wet with slip and the coil is attached in the same way being careful to start at a different place from where the previous coil was joined Thus the whole bowl is built up Where there are any decided hollows made by joining the coils they should be filled in with clay of the consistency of the piece and the bottom and sides smoothed with dampened finger or modelling tool If a moderately deep mould has been chosen after the sides are covered with layers of clay four or more coils may be added above the mould to make a deeper bowl continuing the sides in a graceful line To do this when the first coil above the mould has been attached the bowl is set away out of doors for fifteen or twenty minutes if it is in summer or indoors for a longer time if one is working in the winter Whenever two coils have been built up the piece is set away to harden These coils being free from the mould can be joined on the outside as well as within They are brought gradually in see plate until there is a space five and a half inches in diameter at the top If a central draught lamp is to be used in this bowl a pierced design will be practical as it does away with the necessity for a hole at the bottom of the bowl There is much to be done however before the piece is ready for the design When it has stood for four or five hours or overnight the bowl can be lifted from the mould the cracks on the outside where it was impossible to join the coils are wet with slip and filled in with clay of the consistency of the bowl using the finger or a wooden tool When the bowl is quite dry it is smoothed inside and out first with the oval tool with saw teeth and then with the smooth edged one as described on page The strokes with these tools should be short and firm in every direction The piece is then turned bottom up a circle is drawn half an inch in from the edge of the bottom and the clay within it scraped out so as to leave a flat surface slightly lower than the outer rim This is where the potter cuts his mark a simple quickly made initial in lieu of a signature The top edge after it has been cut as true as possible by eye is made absolutely even by the method described on page The whole piece is then rubbed with a damp sponge and smoothed and polished with the fingers It is now ready for the design see Fig Illustration FIG The top edge of the bowl is marked off into fifths and at three quarters of an inch from the top the design is drawn with pencil so that each time it is repeated the centre shall be directly below a mark on the edge It is first incised with a metal tool in firm sure lines Again the outline is traced this time more deeply Then the clay within the lines is cut out as deep as it has been incised and finally the sharp edge of the tool cuts through the wall close to the line The left hand should support the inner wall of the bowl during this process When the whole design has been made dip the finger in water and soften the edges of the cut portion The bowl is now ready for glazing If possible it will be better to fire such a large piece as this in the biscuit before glazing It will look well if glazed with gray blue or dark green see Chapter V Wall Jar for Plants or Flowers Materials required About pounds of well mixed clay A plaster slab about by inches The oval tools of sheet steel The pointed steel tool A rolling pin Ultramarine blue water colour paint A medium sized paint brush with fine point A saucerful of ground baked clay mixed with water An Indian water jar of basketry smeared with pinon gum pointed at the bottom so that it could be set upright in the ground or hung by leather thongs to a tree suggested the form of this jar One side is made flat so that it can hang against the wall of library or piazza holding some long trailing plant that grows in water ivy or wandering Jew or wild flowers gathered on a walk through woods and lanes What more appropriate way to make it than the Indian process described in Chapter II We shall need about four and a half pounds of clay well mixed A large lump almost two pounds is flattened out on a table with the thick part of the hand and then made even with the rolling pin The sheet of clay should be ten by twelve inches and not less than three eighths of an inch thick Upon it the jar form shown in Fig is outlined with a pencil making it as large as possible to allow for shrinkage It is then cut out with the pointed steel tool and transferred very carefully to a large plaster slab where it remains while the walls are being built upon it A coil of clay is rolled out as described in Chapter II and beginning at the left side of the jar shape at the top it is attached to the edge which has previously been criss crossed with a steel tool and wet with slip all the way around to the opposite side of the top Illustration FIG The jar is then put in the air until quite hard when the next coil is added in the same way The third coil is brought in a little toward the centre and subsequent coils come in still more so as to make the form that of a jar cut exactly in half After each coil is attached it should be left in the air to stiffen or the clay beneath will not support the coil in progress so great is the strain in forming such a shape Each time a coil is added the wall below should be criss crossed with the steel tool an extra precaution and wet with slip Care should be taken not to make the walls too thick and to join the coils and finish the inside as it is made for when the jar is completed it is impossible to get the hand and tool in far enough to smooth and finish it well When the jar is made except for a diamond shaped gap in the middle of the front wall the piece to fill it is cut and fitted in It will lie almost parallel with the back wall Take care to make it full large for the opening and join it to the inner edges most carefully for here if anywhere is the jar liable to crack The top is now made even by eye using the pointed steel tool Illustration FIG Illustration POTTERY FOR BEAUTY AND USE The pale green rose bowl with a moth design at the left has beside it a low Dutch dish On the right is a fruit bowl with a deep green mat glaze Illustration HOW TO MAKE A PLASTER MOULD At the left is a plaster mould and beside it a rose bowl which was partially formed within it See chapter VII Illustration POTTERY FOR BEAUTY AND USE The lamp bowl on the left has a gray blue mat glaze Next to it is a candlestick with the marks of the potter s thumb on every part The wall jar in the background is for plants that grow in water On the right is a flower candlestick in green and white When the jar is somewhat dry two handles see plate are formed of rolls of clay the consistency of that used in making the jar five and a half inches long by an inch wide and half an inch thick These are firmly attached to the back wall of the jar at the top see plate according to the method described on pages and The decoration see Fig is drawn on the rounded front wall of the jar with ultramarine water colour and then built up with powdered burnt clay and water see directions in Chapter IV If possible this piece should be first fired in the biscuit A glaze of dark gray green see Chapter V will finish it most attractively Dutch Dish for Candy Materials required About pounds of clay The wooden modelling tools The sharp pointed steel tool A plaster tile A rolling pin A quaint Dutch dish brought from Holland years ago was the model for this sturdy little piece of pottery It may be used for candy or to hold a vase of flowers or a potted plant protecting a polished table A lump of clay is rolled on a table with the hands and a rolling pin to the thickness of half an inch Upon this clay sheet a rectangle four and a quarter by four and a half inches is drawn with a pencil and cut out with the pointed steel tool It is then transferred to a plaster tile To the edge of this rectangle a coil of clay is attached according to the directions in Chapter II and flared slightly outward taking care not to make the corners sharp but rounded and even After the first coil has stiffened and the sides have been made somewhat uniform and thin it is cut even by eye curving the edge up gradually toward the middle of the sides and depressing it slightly at the corners A second coil is now added but instead of attaching it to the top of the first one it is joined just below the top and inside the first coil When it has stiffened sufficiently in the air the dish is smoothed carefully inside and out with the hand and the wooden modelling tools making the walls even and thin and perfecting the shape The effect of legs is given by cutting under the sides beginning half an inch above the bottom If this is started three quarters of an inch from the corners it will leave a sturdy short leg an inch and a half wide at each of the four corners of the dish A roll of clay about five and a half inches long an inch wide and three eighths of an inch thick is made into a handle see plate which is attached at the middle of one of the sides of the dish At the two points where it is to be joined the side of the dish is criss crossed with the steel tool and wet with slip The bottom is finished by drawing a square with a pencil half an inch in from the edge and depressing it within the square so as to leave a flat even surface The potter s mark is then made within this square A pale green mat glaze see Chapter V makes a charming finish for this piece Rose Bowl with Moth Design Materials required About pounds of clay A rolling pin The oval sheet steel tools The pointed steel tool The steel tool with a flat end A plaster tile This rose bowl which is shown in the plate was built up without a pasteboard outline If one s eye is reasonably true this is not a difficult matter but otherwise the outline process see Chapter II may be followed A piece of clay is first patted flat with the hand and then rolled out with the rolling pin until it is six inches square and about five eighths of an inch thick Upon this clay sheet a circle is marked five inches in diameter cut out and placed on a plaster tile The edge is criss crossed with a steel tool and wet with slip and the first coil is attached see Chapter II Illustration FIG Two coils are built up and then they are pressed outward to form the beginning of the outline shown in Fig This outline was taken from the lower sweep of the wings of a lunar moth and the same moth forms the relief design upon it see Fig Illustration FIG The bowl is then put out of doors until the clay is sufficiently firm to support two more coils These are added flaring them to follow the outline and then the bowl is put away to harden in the air if the temperature is not too cold otherwise indoors It is built up exactly as was the flower jar in Chapter II except that there is no cardboard outline to test it the eye alone is the guide Great care should be taken not to add the coils until those below are quite stiff for the decided flare makes it difficult to keep the sides firm and true in outline The circumference of the bowl at its widest part should be about thirty inches When it is finished the sides within and without are smoothed first with the saw edged oval tool then with the smooth one The edge is cut as true as possible by eye and made perfectly level by pressing it quickly and lightly on the ground glass slab wet with clear water as already described A damp sponge is then passed over the piece inside and out while the fingers rub and polish it dry The bottom is finished and the potter s mark made as described in Chapter II When the bowl is thoroughly dry say the following day it is ready for the decoration Divide the circumference of the top of the bowl into fifths with pencil marks lightly made Then draw the design upon it so that the top of the upper wings shall be not less than an inch from the edge of the bowl Make the moths as nearly life size as the bowl will allow Three and a half inches across from tip to tip of the upper wings with spaces an inch and a half between them will look well if the bowl is large enough Having drawn the design in pencil outline it firmly with the sharp steel tool taking care to bevel the edge of the design Never cut under the edge as the glaze will not flow well over it Go over the outline making it firm and deep with a wooden point Now starting close to the edge of the moth with the flat pointed steel tool scrape away from it so as to cut as deep as the outline close to the design and shave off to nothing at about half an inch from it This will give a low relief effect which is very attractive The antenn are incised see Chapter IV and the markings of the moth may be built up with ground baked clay so as to heighten the relief The bowl may be glazed a pale green with a slight yellow tinge see Chapter V to suggest the colour of the moth It should however if possible be fired first in the biscuit Flower Candlestick Materials required About pounds of clay The wooden modelling tools A plaster tile A candlestick in flower form may be made in green and white for a bedroom in a country house Five leaves much the shape of poppy leaves radiate from the centre making a base from which the stem rises for three inches A round slightly flattened calyx topped by a five petalled flower forms the cup for the candle A sixth leaf starting at the centre of the base curls over until its tip rests sideways against the stem serving the double purpose of a handle and a brace for the stem The base should be modelled first from a single piece of clay placed on a plaster tile Care should be taken to have it sufficiently thick at least half an inch in most places Although the leaves should be indicated do not try to carry the leaf form way to the centre of the base Let the irregular outline of the whole base with an occasional raised tip or edge of a leaf suggest rather than imitate leaves The leaf that forms the handle will of course be more carefully modelled Now mould the stem about an inch in diameter and three inches long with the calyx on the end an inch and three quarters in diameter and an inch high After criss crossing the middle of the base with the pointed steel tool wet it with slip and set the stem on the base working the edges firmly on to it with the flat of the nail and wooden modelling tools The leaf for the handle is brought over against the stem with a graceful turn and there fastened with a touch of slip and some clay added underneath Be careful to have the whole candlestick substantial and not at all thin in construction or it will suggest metal work rather than pottery After the candlestick has stiffened for a few hours a five petalled flower three and three quarter inches in diameter is modelled and put on top of the calyx which has first been criss crossed and wet with slip The cup for the candle is next hollowed out in the centre of the flower and calyx raising the edge of the flower centre slightly above the surrounding petals The candle cup should be a trifle larger than it will need to be when finished as it shrinks somewhat in drying and firing and the glaze too fills it up a little Be sure also to have it deep enough to hold the candle The base stem and handle are finished with a gray green mat glaze see Chapter V while the petals are white the uncoloured mat glaze How to Make a Plaster Mould CHAPTER VII HOW TO MAKE A PLASTER MOULD In building pieces of pottery whose walls have a decided flare a plaster mould will be found most useful Its sides support the coils of clay and enable the potter to form his piece much more rapidly and surely than he could by eye or even with the cardboard outline It should however be used with judgment rather as an aid in beginning a piece which is afterward finished by eye than as a mould in which pieces are duplicated Turning out many pieces exactly alike savours of commercialism and does not develop the potter s individuality Several bowl shaped moulds varied in form and flare if used as suggested will be a great assistance to the potter They are made quite easily as follows A Bowl shaped Mould of Plaster Materials required or pounds of clay well mixed A bowl or mould in bowl shape A dishpan full of plaster of paris A dishpan of water A bag of ground flint A piece of oilcloth inches wide by yards long clothes pins A stout cord or rope A wooden wedge A few drops of olive oil The wooden modelling tools The rectangular tool of sheet steel A large hoe shaped tool A large kitchen spoon Having chosen the bowl that you wish to copy dust it with a cotton cloth in which ground flint is tied and roll out a piece of clay two or more inches larger in diameter than the bottom of the bowl and about an inch thick Press this carefully into the bottom making sure that it touches everywhere Now roll out several other pieces of the same thickness large enough to reach from the upper edge of the bottom piece to the rim of the bowl and four or five inches wide The upper edge of the bottom piece having been cut even and wet with slip these pieces are pressed down firmly and joined to it with the nail stroke before mentioned Great care is also taken to press these pieces against the sides of the bowl When the bowl is lined in this way with a coating of clay an inch or more in thickness at every point close against its walls the clay is smoothed evenly on top on a line with the rim of the bowl using the rectangular tool of sheet steel and set outside to harden When somewhat firm the bowl is filled in with clay until only a space the size of a man s hand is left in the middle It is then set away this time over night to harden Illustration FIG The next day the clay will have dried and shrunk sufficiently to enable the potter to slip it out of the mould Any cracks or hollows that may be found on the outside are wet with slip and filled in with clay of the consistency of the piece After the clay is quite dry the form of the mould should be made perfectly true by hand using the oval sheet steel tools or on the wheel If the latter method is chosen place the clay mould bottom side up on the wheel centre it according to the directions in Chapter III and taking a large hoe shaped tool hold it firmly bracing the hand still better with a stick laid across from a plaster mould or other convenient object on the table to one s lap Having set the wheel in motion hold the dull point of the tool so that it just touches the wall of the mould near the wheel Move the point up very slightly with each revolution of the wheel this will trim and perfect the sides The bottom is made even in the same way Now wash the wheel outside of the mould carefully and oil it with olive oil Take a piece of heavy oilcloth about eight inches wide and long enough to reach around the wheel overlapping about a foot Placing it with the right side in draw it tightly and fasten with clothes pins see Fig Next tie a rope or stout cord around the oilcloth about on a level with the wheel and to make it more secure wedge it with a piece of wood Roll strips of clay about the diameter of a lead pencil and stop the cracks where the oilcloth overlaps also between the oilcloth and the wheel very carefully so as not to touch the clay mould Be careful from now on not to move the wheel until the mould is made Now mix your plaster of paris as follows Have an empty basin or dishpan large enough to hold the quantity necessary for the mould you will learn to judge this pretty well by eye Put in as much water as you will need and sift gradually into it by the handfuls the dry plaster pressing out all lumps in this way the water will reach every particle When there is a small island of plaster about an inch above the surface of the water there will be enough Let the plaster get thoroughly saturated by the water as it will in a few minutes then mix with the hands or a large spoon until it is the consistency of thick cream Pour it gradually around and over the clay mould not all in one place until it is about an inch and a half or two inches above the bottom of it Let it set for an hour or more until it seems perfectly hard The oilcloth is then taken off and with the dull point of the hoe shaped tool the bottom is trimmed true on the wheel in the same way as the wheel made pottery is finished The sides should also be smoothed and made even with the straight edged sheet steel tool It then looks like a great frosted cake When the plaster is hard and set the mould is taken from the wheel and reversed so that the clay may be removed To do this dig out the inside of the clay mould with a large sheet steel tool taking care not to come near the plaster which would be injured by the steel The shell of clay remaining can be easily lifted out with the fingers One who does not own a wheel can make a mould by setting the clay bowl bottom up in the centre of a small shallow bread or dish pan which must then be well oiled on its inner surface The plaster of paris is mixed and poured around and over the clay mould as already described Illustration FIG If one uses a great deal of clay plaster basins may be made for drying out the superfluous water from the clay after it has been mixed These are moulded in the form shown in Fig the straight sided circular cavity in the centre being about three inches deep and the whole slab perhaps sixteen inches square The basin part like the bowl shaped mould just described is first formed in solid clay and the mould is made in the same manner Plaster slabs both round and square to hold the pieces of pottery while they are being made and dried may also be moulded Rose Bowl Started in a Mould Materials required A bowl shaped mould of plaster inches in diameter at the bottom and inches at the top About pounds of clay A bag of ground flint The wooden modelling tools The oval tools of sheet steel The sharp pointed steel tool A bowl of slip A small sponge A rolling pin A charming rose bowl may be built up in the plaster mould described in this chapter About three and a half pounds of well worked clay will be needed and the usual tools A small lump of clay is first patted out with the hands on a table or board then rolled smooth with a rolling pin until it is three eighths of an inch thick and about six inches across This is laid into the bottom of the mould which has previously been dusted with ground flint tied in a cotton cloth The clay is pressed lightly but carefully against the bottom and sides and then made even at its upper edge with a wooden tool Strokes of the wooden modelling tool cutting this upper edge criss cross and a touch of slip prepare it for the first roll of clay which is made and attached as described in Chapter II These coils need not be as thick as those used in making the first pieces As the worker gains experience he can make the walls of his pieces much lighter than at first and still keep them strong Subsequent coils are joined in the same way taking care to press each against the wall of the mould as well as upon the coil beneath When the sides of the bowl are covered a coil is attached above the edge of the mould This should be almost vertical instead of flaring and a second coil which is joined after the first has stiffened out of doors for twenty minutes is brought in slightly toward the centre The bowl is then left over night when it will be quite dry and have shrunk sufficiently to slip easily out of the mould It is turned bottom up on a table and the cracks between the coils are wet with slip and carefully filled in with clay of the consistency of the bowl After it has been set away to harden for a few hours it is made smooth and even with the oval tools of sheet steel as described in previous chapters In trimming the walls to an even thickness they may be made comparatively thin a little less than a quarter of an inch Next the bottom is finished and the potter s mark made The edge after it has been bevelled by eye is perfected on the ground glass slab Illustration FIG The piece is now ready for its decoration This is the design shown in Fig The circumference of the top of the bowl is divided into fifths and marks are made in pencil half an inch below the rim Just below each of these marks the design is drawn placing it so that if a line were drawn straight down from the pencil mark one of the oval figures would be on each side of it The centre of the design is pierced as indicated in Fig by the method described in Chapter IV and a deep incised line surrounds it A pale green mat glaze see Chapter V completes the bowl The Making of a Tile CHAPTER VIII THE MAKING OF A TILE The ancient Egyptians were probably the first tile makers Some of their most remarkable pieces of enamel work are clay plaques or slabs made as early as B C Figures of men and animals were drawn upon them modelled in low relief and coated with enamels brilliant and beautiful in colour In other tiles a kind of mosaic was made a combination of fine clay and enamels which were mixed into soft pastes The design was modelled and fitted together in these coloured pastes which when they were fired the heat fixed and vitrified Again these cunning craftsmen left in the clay incisions forming a design Into these settings so to speak small pieces of glass or enamel were fitted and when fused into place by the heat of the kiln suggested jewels Now a days our artist potters are designing and modelling tile for wall and floor decoration whole mantels to match the colour scheme of a library or my lady s boudoir To the uninitiated the making of a tile seems almost too simple to learn just a slab of clay cut square and baked Simple enough it is to be sure yet it has difficulties enough to make it interesting Illustration FIG Suppose we mould a tile and learn by experience just what the difficulties are and how to surmount them Illustration FIG The clay that is used in moulding tiles is the same as that of which the other pieces of pottery are made i e a mixture of fire and ball or blue clay with the addition of a large amount of what is called by potters grog This is fire clay which after baking becomes pale yellow in colour and quite hard It is pounded into pieces the size of a small pea and smaller and mixed thoroughly through the clay to act as a tempering agent Mould in as much of the grog as the clay will hold Too much will make it lose its plasticity and separate into small lumps but short of this the more grog the tile clay contains the better as being baked and shrunken it minimises the chances of cracking by shrinkage In making a tile the following materials will be required About pounds of tile clay A level board about by inches A frame made by screwing a strip of wood of an inch thick by inches wide and inches long on each of the long edges of a board inches wide by inches long pieces of white cheese cloth by inches A rolling pin The rectangular sheet steel tool A T square or a piece of sheet metal by inches A strong sharp knife A bowl of slip The boxwood modelling tools The pointed steel tool The steel tool with flat point To begin with a large piece of tile clay is worked until all the air holes are out of it as already described Illustration FIG A wooden board which is absolutely level having previously been covered with a piece of wet white cheese cloth which is tacked securely upon it the clay is moulded into a square by hand and laid upon the board It is then pounded flat with the thick part of the hand into an irregular square cake and rolled with a rolling pin wet with slip until it is a little less than half an inch thick Illustration FIG A wooden frame made of a board fourteen and a half inches wide by twenty one inches long with a strip of wood the same length seven eighths of an inch thick when planed and two inches wide screwed on to each of the long edges should have been provided beforehand A piece of wet cheese cloth is spread upon this board and the clay square is carefully transferred to it fitting it carefully into the form by patting and pressing with the hand It should then be smoothed with the rectangular tool of sheet steel Illustration FIG Illustration FIG The tile must now be reinforced for the reason that the outer edge which dries and shrinks first would naturally crack when the inside finally dried and shrank and so spoil the tile When reinforced the edges being double thickness dry more slowly making the whole tile shrink evenly Six pieces of clay are rolled into as many rope like strips Five of these strips are patted flat with the hand until they are about an inch and a half wide and not quite half an inch thick They are then laid along the outer edges of the tile which have first been lightly brushed with slip and across the middle see Fig pressing them firmly onto the tile and joining the edges carefully The sixth strip is cut into two short pieces which are laid in at the centre between the three strips crossing the tile see Fig and firmly attached by moulding them against the other strips and working the edges on to the tile upon which a touch of slip has been brushed A damp piece of cheese cloth is laid on the tile and it is again rolled with the rolling pin Next it is made smooth with the sheet steel tool and the four depressions are moulded evenly as shown in Fig It is then set away over night to get in proper condition to cut and finish The following day put a board on the bottom of the tile and reverse the frame so that the tile will slide off on to the board Then with a T square or a piece of sheet metal eight by eight inches the size of the tile laid upon it cut around the edges with a sharp strong knife The tile is then set away to receive its decoration which should be made the day following Care should always be taken to lay the tile only upon an absolutely level board or other flat surface in drying as otherwise it will warp and dry unevenly Illustration THE MAKING OF A TILE The face of the tile For detail of this design see Fig The back of a tile showing the potter s mark and the rough texture of the tile clay Illustration FIG Illustration FIG Having chosen a simple design for example the one shown in Fig draw it upon the tile in pencil Next go over the lines with the pointed tool of boxwood and with a curved pointed wooden tool incise the outline still deeper Make a clean cut firm outline broad and deep with a bevelled edge This is of course supposing that the tile has not become very dry in which case the tool used should be the pointed steel one finishing with the wooden tool The whole design should be deeply incised with firm sure strokes The pieces of grog which the tool will run against now and then will not injure the outline if the hand is firm Should one by mistake cut away more of the design than was intended it can easily be repaired with a touch of slip and a small piece of clay the consistency of the tile worked in with the pointed steel tool The portions of the design which are indicated by dots in Fig are depressed with the flat pointed steel tool according to the method for leaving the design in low relief described in Chapter IV Before setting the tile away to dry for the last time the potter incises his mark on the back A dull yellow mat glaze or a gray green one see Chapter V will finish it attractively A tile such as this eight inches square is rather large for some purposes it is however most effective as a decoration and may do practical service in holding a flower pot or vase of flowers protecting a table or wooden mantel from moisture Fireplace tiles are of course considerably smaller and those for use on a table are lighter as well They are made by the same process only using a smaller frame and rolling the clay thinner Some designs for tiles are shown in Figs and The Kiln CHAPTER IX THE KILN Pottery until it is fired has little or no practical value One who owns a piece of Gay Head ware made in Martha s Vineyard and called by the name of the bluffs of whose clay it is made will appreciate this Though charming in colour a terra cotta background with swirling lines of pale yellow black and white it can only be put in one spot on the highest shelf out of reach of children and others who like to look with their hands If it were baked the colour which is its chief charm would be lost and it is therefore so fragile that a rude touch will break or deface it In the early days of pottery making when utility was everything pots for cooking and domestic purposes were baked either before the fire or covered with bark and other burning fuel which hardened the clay and made it strong enough for service We do not find traces of kilns however among the relics of those early potters Probably the first people to use the kiln were the old Egyptians One which is represented in their mural paintings was a high circular chamber made of brick The floor near the bottom was perforated and beneath it was the fuel which was put in through an opening on the side The kiln used by the early Greek potters had a place for fuel on one side and an upper chamber for the pieces of pottery with a door through which it could be put in and withdrawn This differed from the Egyptian kiln only in having a dome Many of the kilns of the present day are shaped almost exactly like those used by the early Greeks So important a part does the kiln play in perfecting a piece of pottery putting the final touch upon it the touch that shall make or mar that the potter realises he must plan before anything else either to own a good kiln or to know of one where his pieces can be sent to be fired Unless one wishes to make pottery on a large scale as a business the expense and care of owning one s own kiln is unnecessary There are makers of art pottery near the principal cities who for a reasonable amount will fire one s pieces admirably and with much less risk than an amateur could possibly do them that is providing one uses the same kind of clay as is employed by the owners of the kiln where one s pottery is to be fired If not this clay can usually be purchased at the pottery ready mixed at slight expense Even though one may not care to assume the cost and responsibility of owning a kiln it may be of interest to know something of the construction of kilns and how they do their work THE OPEN FIRE KILN Illustration FIG A is the chamber for the pottery BB the fire boxes CC the firebacks DDDDD the passage and outlets through which the heat enters the kiln The open fire kiln is preferred by many potters Such kilns have been used for generations by potters in England and for ware that needs hard firing they have proved most reliable Fig shows the interior of one of these kilns and Fig the ground plan From these diagrams one can get an idea of the principle on which such kilns are run This kiln is built mostly of fire brick and should be under cover for more than one reason First there is no danger from frost if the kiln is inclosed by a wooden building and then it is more convenient for the potter to do his work where he is not exposed to the weather Illustration FIG AAAA are the fire boxes BBBBBBBBBBBB the passages for the hot air CCCCC the outlets for the hot air The kiln is circular built on a foundation of brick or stone and strengthened with bands of wrought iron At all four sides of the central chamber where the pottery is placed are fire boxes where the coal is fed on to a grate below the level of the floor of the chamber The hot air from the fire boxes finds two outlets one through a direct escape close to the box the other through a passage and out at the centre of the floor Within the central chamber are piled the saggers great circular boxes or drums made of fire clay all of which if possible contain pottery but whether full or empty they must fill up the chamber as their clay holds and radiates heat which would otherwise be lost The office of the saggers is to protect the pieces of pottery from direct contact with the flame smoke and ashes of the fire The heat from the fire boxes if it rushed directly into the kiln would fire the pieces near the bottom of the chamber too hard so slabs of fire brick called firebacks are arranged so as to send the heat up see Fig It then passing up between the saggers which stacked one above the other form flues to improve the draught passes off at the top opening This aperture as will be seen in Fig has a slab supported by bricks above it to control the draught The heat escapes through the cone and thus through the chimney The cone is made of ordinary bricks and its office is to help the draught There is another kind of kiln much like this model except that it has a down draught The heated air as it escapes passes down through an opening in the floor along a horizontal passage up and out This keeps the heat in the kiln for a longer time but it also confines the gases which affect the colour of the ware so that it is not practicable for art pottery Seen from the outside on a day when the kiln is being filled its aspect is quite different Inside the great brick chamber workmen are stacking the saggers filled with pieces of pottery some of which not yet packed are standing on tables near at hand They look wan and pale faint grayish green or leaden gray Not until they have felt the fierce heat of the kiln will they glow with living green or will the beauty of their blues appear Yellow that is almost orange seems to be only a deep cream colour before it is fired Then there are pieces of green or unbaked clay to be fired in the biscuit that is without the glaze These are put in another part of the kiln Just a word about the saggers These huge rough boxes of burnt fire clay whose office has already been spoken of are sometimes bottomless simply rings Should a sagger be too low to contain a piece that is placed in it as is often the case one can build up the clay box to the required height with the bottomless saggers Between every two saggers rolls of clay are laid coiled around the edge to hold them together When the kiln is filled at last with its stacks of saggers the doorway is bricked up and the fire started The open fire kiln requires the best part of three days to complete it The first day it is filled with pottery and the fire started In firing a kiln the heat should be raised very slowly All that night the fire is watched and fed as it must be kept at the requisite temperature for if it gets low or as the potters say slips the glaze is spoiled and the pottery must all be reglazed and fired again The weather affects the kiln the draught not being so good on a damp or rainy day as on a fair one and the coal also must be specially chosen for the kiln It takes several tons to fire one kiln so that the success or failure of a firing is no light matter The second day much attention must be given to keeping the fire up and at about nightfall the guides are drawn as follows At equal distances around the kiln are four peep holes small round apertures on a level with the eye which are closed with a cylindrical tube having a transparent asbestos end In the glare of the kiln directly on a line with these peep holes one can see a row of clay rings which were daubed with glaze before the fire was started Having withdrawn the cylinder which closes the hole the potter runs in a long metal rod with a hook on the end catches a ring and draws it out He can tell from the appearance of this ring or guide how the kiln is firing and about when the pieces will be done Usually they are finished that night but the kiln is not opened until it has cooled for many hours THE MUFFLE KILN The muffle kiln is shown in Fig Illustration FIG A is the muffle box or chamber for the pottery B B B B B B B are the arches supporting the box and other parts of the kiln C C The doors where the fuel and pottery respectively are put in D D D The passages for the heated air E The ash pan This fires at a low degree of heat compared with the open fire kiln It is mostly used for under glaze pottery and for glazing In this kiln the fire could not come in direct contact with the ware so that saggers are unnecessary instead there is a system of shelves upon which the pottery is placed The fuel which may be wood is fed through a door on one side of the lower part of the kiln with an ash box below A brick arch supports the muffle box or chamber where the pottery is placed On the opposite side from the furnace door is the opening through which the pieces are put into the kiln This is carefully bricked up before the fire is started The hot air passes through a passage extending around all sides and above the box and the outlet is over the door where the pottery goes in A slab extending nearly across this outlet controls the draught Basket Covered Pottery CHAPTER X BASKET COVERED POTTERY There has always been a close connection between pottery and basketry Those who study Indian handicrafts learn that pottery was evolved from basketry in the long ago Neltje Blanchan suggests that it may have happened in some such way as this Perhaps a hunter returned home hungry one day and his wife anxious to hasten dinner for her impatient lord coated her cooking basket with clay that she might set it directly over the fire without danger of burning Imagine the woman s surprise and joy to find on removing it from the embers after dinner that she had a basket plus an earthenware pot The two crafts have helped each other from that day to this The Indian woman suspends her earthen cooking jar with coils of wild grapevine which ever and anon she smears with wet clay when the flames come too near Japanese craftsmen enmesh their pottery jars with wistaria stems to protect them from breakage or to suspend them against the wall where growing plants or trailing vines may fill them to overflowing Even the little ginger jar one buys for a few cents in Chinatown has its case and handle of pliant cane Charming things may be made for the beautifying of one s own or another s house if one knows something of the two crafts A few of them are described in the following pages Indian Pottery Bowl Suspended with Raffia Materials required An Indian pottery bowl in white and Indian red inches in diameter at the top A bunch of Indian red raffia A curtain ring A tapestry needle No Any one who has made raffia hats with the knots that our mothers used to call macram in the early eighties will see by a glance at the plate how the network of raffia which incloses this bowl is fashioned The bowl is the first consideration It may be bought at an Indian store for about a dollar or if one prefers one can mould one s own bowl of flower pot clay In that case however the white background which is so effective in the Indian ware will be missed Illustration BASKET COVERED POTTERY The straight sided hanging jar on the left was once the pillow of a Chinese woman Beside it is a green bowl of Spanish pottery inclosed and suspended with green rattan The small jar below is a Flemish piece with a covering of pale green rattan Above is an Indian bowl with a knotted raffia covering The three handled plant bowl on the right has a gray green mat glaze It is suspended with raffia ropes To begin with Thread a No tapestry needle with a strand of Indian red raffia Twist the end three or four times around the middle and forefinger of the left hand and cover the small ring thus made with button hole stitches The ring should be about an inch in diameter Illustration FIG Finish off the end of the raffia by sewing several stitches through and through the ring Pin this ring to a cushion on one s lap or to some firm soft object near at hand Take two strands of raffia double them around the ring and with the four ends thus made tie a Solomon s knot as follows Hold the two upper strands straight and taut Bend the under strand on the left across them to the right see Fig and bring the under strand on the right over the end of the left strand back of the middle strands and through the loop made by the left strand in starting Another pair of strands is knotted on in the same way and another until there are thirteen groups around the ring Beginning anywhere on the ring the strands on the right of a group are brought beside the two on the left of the group to the right of it and the middle pair of the four are held straight down while the strands on the right and left are knotted upon them as already described This knot should be about half an inch from those in the previous row Make a double knot this time that is repeat the process already described Take the strand which was on the left after the first knot was tied bring it over the middle strands to the right and after bringing the strand on the right over the end of the left one and back of the middle strands pass it up through the loop made by the left strand in starting The two strands at the right of the right hand group are next knotted in the same way with two on the left of the next group to the right and so it goes on around the net making a double Solomon s knot each time Five rows more of this knotting are made each row being half an inch from the previous one except the fifth which is three quarters of an inch from the fourth Now bring all the strands from three groups together at an inch and three quarters from the last row of knotting Hold the middle one of the three groups taut and tie the strands to right and left upon it in a Solomon s knot Tie another knot close to the first one and another until there are seven one below the other Three more groups are brought together at an inch and three quarters from the last row of knotting and tied in the same way Then another three The fourth bunch will have four groups of strands in it as there were thirteen groups in all at starting Two of these groups the middle ones are held taut and those to left and right are tied upon this double group as the others were Then taking the long ends of one of these bunches tie them again in three Solomon s knots at an inch and three quarters from the seventh knot They are next brought straight down without knotting for two inches more when two knots are made For two and three quarter inches more they are brought without knotting then tied and wound around a large ring an old curtain ring about two inches in diameter will do When all four bunches have been knotted in the same way and the ends of all have been fastened securely to the curtain ring the ring is covered neatly with button hole stitch in raffia and a raffia binding about half an inch wide is made just below the ring where the strands are fastened to it Green Pottery Jar Inclosed and Suspended with Brown Rattan Materials required The Pottery Jar About pounds of clay The wooden modelling tools The rectangular tool of sheet steel The pointed steel tool A bowl of slip A small sponge The Basket Covering About six lengths of No deep brown rattan A piece of fine but strong wire inches long A pair of pliers A bunch of deep brown raffia Around the quaint and attractive hanging jar from which this one is copied is woven a tale as curious as its covering of knotted brown twigs It is this the rectangular green jar which looks like a pottery box was once the casket in which some Chinese lady kept her pomades and perfumes When she slept her head which had been dressed most elaborately with the aforesaid pomades was laid upon this same pottery box for a pillow another instance of the painfulness of pride in China How strange the little Chinese lady would think it of us to use her earthen pillow as we do for a hanging flower jar Who covered it with knotted wistaria twigs I should suspect it was some deft fingered Japanese though the jar was bought in Hawaii It will not be very difficult to copy First there is the box like jar to be made A rectangular bottom is cut from a well worked lump of clay after it has been patted flat with the hand and rolled with the rolling pin It should be five by three and a half inches which allows an inch on length and breadth for shrinkage Upon this foundation coils of clay are built as described in previous chapters making them thinner however than usual not over a quarter of an inch thick As the walls are built they should be finished carefully inside and out keeping them straight and true at the corners as well as on all sides When the jar is seven and a quarter inches high the top is made even by eye and perfected on the ground glass slab as described in Chapter II A rectangular piece of clay is then rolled and cut the size of the bottom an oval piece about two by three inches is cut out of the middle with the pointed steel tool and it is left on a plaster slab to stiffen for half an hour The upper edge of the jar is then criss crossed with the pointed steel tool and wet with slip and this flat top is attached to it deftly and carefully After drying for several hours it may be finished with the sheet steel tool the shape perfected and the surface dampened with a sponge and polished with the fingers When it has dried for several days it is coated with a glossy green glaze and fired Illustration FIG The covering of knotted rattan is made as follows Six pliable lengths of No brown rattan are needed for this covering They must be carefully selected for as they are to be tied they should when wet be almost as pliable as cord It is not difficult to find them as soft as this especially after they have been dyed In starting a length of rattan which has been wet until soft is tied around the jar at about half an inch from the top The long end is twisted once around this foundation ring This may be done off of the jar if it is easier When the ring has been replaced on the jar two pieces of very pliable rattan about sixty inches long are doubled around the ring at the middle of the front of the jar and tied in a Solomon s knot as already described see Fig The second part of the knot however is not tied as the raffia was in making the knotted covering for the Indian bowl Instead the end which is on the right after the first knot has been tied is brought over to the left above the middle strands and the one on the left coming down over its end goes back of the middle strands and up through the loop left in starting the right strand see Fig Another pair of strands of the same length is tied in this way around the ring at the middle of the back of the jar and a pair at either end The strands at the right of the knot in the middle of the front are then brought beside those at the left of the group on the right end and these are knotted as just described at about an inch and three quarters from the first row and at the corner of the jar The remaining strands of the group on the right end are knotted with those at the left of the group in the middle of the back and so on around the jar There will then be four knots all an inch and three quarters from the first row and each at a corner of the jar Three more rows of knotting are made in the same way and then the four ends remaining at the front and back after the fifth row of knots has been made are wet with warm water until very pliable and tied together under the jar Those from the sides are tied in the same manner and at the same place All the ends are bound securely just below these knots with fine wire and over this an inch wide band of raffia The ends are cut irregular lengths the longest not more than fourteen inches from the bottom of the jar A handle is then made as follows A piece of pliable brown rattan No about two yards long is wet until soft and passed around the knot nearest the top at one end of the jar The ends are brought together and twisted for their entire length At the opposite end of the jar they are brought around the knot nearest the top turned up and firmly bound to the handle with a piece of wire which may then be covered with a binding of raffia Take care to make this wire binding secure for this is the place where the greatest strain comes It is in such places as this that the Oriental craftsmen show their superiority Their ends thus bound are bound to stay while ours sometimes slip Jar of Flemish Pottery Inclosed with Pale Green Rattan Materials required A jar of Flemish pottery inches high inches in diameter at the bottom and inch at the top About six lengths of No green rattan A little jar of quaint Flemish pottery charming in form and colour is the foundation of this piece This ware which is just becoming known to us is interesting in many ways First of all for its own sake the attractive shapes candlesticks bowls jugs jars and tiles all have the stamp of individuality rare in any ware that is within reach of the average purse The colours are beautiful deep greens and blues soft browns and dull orange for the most part Some of the pieces are made by Belgian school children others in potteries started by a club of men in Belgium followers of Ruskin who have revived the craft employing only Belgians to design and mould the ware The old methods are carefully followed the pieces are wheel made not formed in moulds Much of the decoration is done by boys who make a charming picture clad in blouses and sabots their young faces all interested and absorbed in the work The open meshed weave of pale green rattan with which this jar is inclosed only slightly veils the colour of the glaze deep green at the base shading through blue to a soft mousy brown at the top The covering is made as follows One end of a piece of green No rattan twenty seven inches long is tied into a ring two inches and a half in diameter Around this foundation ring the long end of the rattan is twisted in and out until it has made the circuit twice three times counting the foundation ring Some very pliable lengths of No green rattan are cut into twenty pieces thirty two inches long They are wet until quite soft and then two of them are doubled around the ring and tied with a Solomon s knot see Fig Another pair is doubled and knotted upon the ring and another until ten groups have been attached at intervals around the circumference Starting with any one of the groups the two strands on the right are brought beside the two on the left of the group to the right of it and knotted together as described on page at three quarters of an inch from the first row of knots The two remaining strands of the right hand group are brought beside those on the left of the next group to the right where another knot is made and so on until the circuit is complete One more row of knots is made in the same way three quarters of an inch from those in the previous row The whole network is then wet thoroughly and fitted over the lower part of the jar tying it if necessary to mould the rattan in to the form At about an inch and a half from the last row of knots a row of pairing is made with a very pliable piece of No green rattan For the benefit of those who may not know this simple basket weave the following directions are given Holding the jar with its partial covering of rattan right side up draw the ends of the strands remaining after the last row of knots was tied close up against the sides of the jar Double the pliable piece of No rattan around a pair of ends which formed the middle strands of one of the knots Taking the upper half of the piece which seems to come from behind the two strands to the left of them bring it over them under the next pair and out in front Hold down with the left hand the end you have just used while with the right bring the other end which was on the right of the first pair of strands over the next pair of strands on the right and under the next It is now held down in front while the process is repeated always taking the end on the left to weave with Illustration FIG The doubled strands or spokes on which these stitches are woven should be drawn close together till not more than a sixteenth of an inch apart so that they will cling to the jar When the circuit of the jar has been made another row is woven At the end of this second row both of the weaving strands are cut so that their ends will come back of the last pair of strands in the circuit For half an inch the strands are drawn up toward the top of the jar without weaving then one row more of the pairing is made and after thoroughly wetting the ends of the vertical strands the following border is woven Bring each pair of strands over the next three on the right under the succeeding two and outside of the jar The entire circuit of the border is made in this way only leaving the first part of it loose and open so that the last strands can be woven in easily When finished the border is again wet and its edge made even and true on a line with the top of the jar or slightly above it The ends of the strands are then cut close to the jar so as to allow each to lie back of the last strand it went under If the covering stands out from the jar does not cling as it ought it should be thoroughly wet and bound around with string or raffia and firmly tied until it is dry Fig shows the completed covering Green Pottery Bowl with Covering and Handles of Green Rattan Materials required A green pottery bowl inches in diameter at the upper edge and at the bottom pieces of pale green No rattan inches long lengths of pale green No rattan This green bowl inclosed with a knotted covering of pale green rattan may be used as a hanging flower pot or for cut flowers The original was a piece of deep green Spanish pottery but if one can make the bowl so much the better as long as the dimensions are those given above In starting fifteen pieces of No green rattan which have been wet until quite soft and pliable are laid side by side in a group which is doubled at its centre and the ends tied securely together about two inches from where it was doubled One group of ends containing fifteen pieces is made flat and even and then separated into three groups of five pieces each and braided in a three stranded plait ten and a half inches long It is then tied securely The other group is separated and braided in the same way keeping the strands flat and the plaiting close and even Fifteen more pieces of rattan of the same size and length which have been wet until pliable are now passed through the loop made by doubling the other pieces bent at the middle and tied as the others were two inches from the place where they were doubled The ends of these pieces are also braided in two plaits for ten and a half inches and then tied firmly Illustration FIG Holding the braids so that the ends of the strands turn up and starting at about two inches from where the braiding stops a pliable piece of No rattan is doubled around the pair of ends on the left of one of the groups and is woven in pairing upon these ends and those succeeding them keeping them about half an inch apart As there is an uneven number of ends in each group the fifteenth one is brought beside the first end in the next group and the pairing woven upon them see Fig Thus it goes on until the circuit has been made when the bowl is fitted into the ring the braided handles of course turning up and the ring about an inch below the top of the bowl If the ring is too loose the stitches may be wet and drawn up a little if too tight they are wet and stretched Two more rows are woven with the handles turning down then the work is reversed so that the unfinished ends shall turn down The ends are wet until soft and pliable and at three quarters of an inch from the last row of pairing they are tied into a row of the knots described on page A second row of knots is made at an inch from the first The case is then fitted over the bowl and wet if it is necessary in order to mould it in to fit the shape Turn the bowl upside down and at half an inch from the last row of knotting double a pliable piece of No rattan around a pair of ends anywhere on the circumference of the covering and weave one row of pairing drawing the ends of the strands in to fit the bottom of the bowl This will bring them about three eighths of an inch apart Another row of pairing is woven and then a base is made as follows After the ends have been wet until pliable start with any one of the pairs bringing it over the first pair on the right under the second over the third and under the fourth taking care to leave the base loose and open where it begins that the last strands may be easily woven in see Fig The next pair of ends on the right is woven in the same way over the first on its right under the second over the third and under the fourth So it goes on around the bowl until the time comes to weave in the last strands which will not be difficult if the caution in regard to leaving the beginning open and loose has been heeded When the base is finished wet it thoroughly and draw up the strands or let them out until the edge is even and on a line with the bottom of the bowl The ends of the strands are then cut so that the tip of each will lie behind the last strand it went under Illustration FIG Three Handled Bowl for Plants or Flowers Materials required About pounds of clay A plaster mould for a bowl The wooden modelling tools The oval tools of sheet steel The sharp pointed steel tool A bunch of raffia This charming bowl for a growing plant or cut flowers may either be used as a centrepiece on a table or suspended by a heavy raffia braid in the recess of a window or on the porch The dull gray green mat glaze with which it is finished harmonises delightfully with the colours of growing things It is formed in a bowl shaped plaster mould in the same way as the rose bowl described in Chapter VII and the bowl for a lamp in Chapter VI but the bottom is made unusually thick three quarters of an inch to allow for cutting away as the form is as nearly a hemisphere as possible only flattened slightly at the bottom When the bowl has been built up to within an inch perhaps of the top of the mould if it is not a deep one make the next coil free from the sides of the mould almost vertical in fact The coil that succeeds it slopes in ever so slightly This will make the shape deep enough It is now necessary to let the bowl harden enough so that it can easily be slipped out of the mould The hollows between the coils after they have been wet with slip are filled in with clay of the consistency of the bowl The bowl is again set away to harden and then smoothed and finished as described in previous chapters aiming to trim it as nearly as possible to the form of a half sphere After the edge has been cut as nearly true as possible by eye it is made absolutely even by the process described in Chapter II Illustration FIG Three handles are cut from a flat piece of clay about three inches wide by sixteen long and half an inch thick in the shape shown in Fig and attached as follows The circumference of the top of the bowl is divided into thirds and marked with a tool or pencil It is then an easy matter to place the handles so that the centre of each shall be just above one of the marks on the top edge At the points where the handles are to be attached the top of the bowl is criss crossed with the pointed steel tool and wet with slip The handles are then placed in position and their edges worked closely against the top and sides of the bowl with the flat of the nail They should be curved in a little to follow the lines of the bowl see Plate After the inside has been glazed with the glossy mixture mentioned in Chapter V a mat glaze of gray green will complete the bowl The three raffia ropes by which the bowl is suspended are made as follows Thirty strands of natural coloured raffia are doubled around one of the handles and the ends are braided in a three stranded plait for twelve inches where they are tied Two other braids are made on the other handles in the same way and when they are twelve inches long the strands from all three braids are united in a thick loop Indian Pottery CHAPTER XI INDIAN POTTERY In no other country can primitive pottery be so conveniently studied as in ours Within our borders he who digs may read the history of clay working from the earliest days Those who are denied this study at first hand will find in museums plenty of material quaint bowls and jars some of them smoke stained and cracked but all wonderfully well preserved when one thinks of their age From the rudest pots made by inferior tribes we can trace the progress of the craft gradually advancing until in the pottery found in or near Mexico we see what may be considered the masterpieces of American ceramic art In the United States the pottery of the Pueblo tribes ranks first and close to that the charming wares of the Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast There are many tribes which are still practising the craft some following the old methods while others influenced by the white man are making ware of little interest to the student of primitive pottery The Indians of the Pueblo country are using almost the same processes as those of ancient days Illustration FIG Illustration FIG The pottery of different sections of the country varies in material form colour and decoration That the ware of a certain tribe was crude and imperfect does not necessarily indicate that the people who made it were inferior in culture but that the natural conditions were not favourable to pottery making A tribe living near clay beds would as naturally make good pottery as one around whose homes materials for basket making grew in abundance would excel in that craft Perhaps on the whole the pottery of the South is more advanced than that of the Northern tribes probably because of the difference in climate While the people of the North were wandering hunters for the most part those of the South were more prosperous and stay at home and would be likely to have more wants than the Northern tribes with leisure to gratify them Illustration FIG Illustration FIG Illustration FIG As to the uses to which the Indians put their pottery most of the pieces show with simple straightforwardness what purposes they served In only a few cases is there any doubt notably some spool shaped articles of clay found in the Ohio Valley At first pottery was chiefly used for the storing cooking and carrying of water and food taking the place in some degree of vessels of wicker horn and stone This has always remained its most important function Earthen vessels were employed in religious and other ceremonies and earthen tools were often made while there are besides the myriads of pipes a host of small clay vessels and figures which were evidently toys or used in games See Figs and It is interesting to note the difference between our cooking pots and those of this primitive people Theirs have almost invariably a round or cone shaped base See Fig which Prof W H Holmes explains was natural as among barbarous nations hard level floors were the exception while those of sand and soft earth were the rule Under those conditions the rounded base would be much the best In putting the pot over the fire the fuel or other supports kept it in position Often cooking vessels were made with short strong handles See Fig or a flaring rim so that they could be conveniently swung over the fire with vines or cords In certain parts of the country where the Indians made salt by evaporating the water from saline springs large vat shaped vessels of clay are found which were evidently moulded for the purpose They are peculiar because of their size and the great thickness of the walls while almost invariably they have on the outer surface markings which seem to have been impressed with a woven fabric Illustration FIG Other Indians made maple sugar using earthen vessels to collect and boil the sap Numbers of the early writers tell of the use of clay vessels for drums and earthen whistles and rattles are common to day see Figs and A curious shaped implement somewhat like a toadstool was evidently a modelling tool to support the walls of a partially stiffened piece of pottery from within while the outer surface was finished with other tools In the lower Mississippi Valley clays were employed in plastering the walls of cave dwellings as well as for the floors Illustration FIG As burial urns pottery bowls and vases were often made use of Not so often however for holding the ashes of the dead as for the skull and other bones which were crowded into a single jar or bowl such as was common in the household This was covered with a smaller vessel see Fig Sometimes several of these bowls surrounded and covered the bones Occasionally an earthen casket seems to have been made especially for the purpose There have been found beside these burial vessels in the Indian graves smaller receptacles for food and even rude toys The latter were usually animal forms figurines images of fish turtles and birds It is surmised that these were offerings made with the expectation of their being of service to the dead in a future life Illustration FIG Unlike the Egyptians the Indians made little use of clay in moulding beads and other personal ornaments They evidently did not find it gay enough in colour not knowing the secret of the brilliant enamels with which the early Egyptian potters coated their clays Pipes while they were often made of stone and other substances were in some parts of the country moulded from clay and ranged in form from a simple tube to curious and grotesque shapes Those made by the Iroquois were particularly elaborate a head of an animal or bird formed the bowl or a snake coiled about it see Fig One would have thought that in making their clay pots which were primarily planned to serve useful purposes and were moreover somewhat perishable no attention would have been given to decoration yet this is far from being the case Bowls cups and cauldrons water jars and bottles see Figs and were often elaborately incised with beautiful and intricate designs The forms too were simple and good Illustration FIG Illustration INDIAN POTTERY The black pitcher on the right is of Santa Clara ware Beside it is a water cooler or tenaja made by a Zu i The clay used at first was such as could be found almost anywhere near the surface and consequently was full of impurities Later however clean clays were much sought after and no pains were spared to grind and work them into good condition This was done with the feet or hands or both As the craft advanced potters began to temper their clay with other ingredients according to the use to which the vessel was to be put For instance the clay for toys and the smaller vessels needed no tempering Pipes were made of such clay or of one tempered with a finely ground substance while cooking pots and cauldrons which were subjected to constant heat were made of clay containing a large amount of coarser tempering ingredients Some of the tempering agents were rock sand pulverised shell bits of baked pottery cinders ashes of bark and even raw vegetal materials The heat at which the pieces were fired was rarely strong enough to change any of the mineral substances in the clay Illustration FIG In shaping the pieces the fingers did the work unaided except where a basket or gourd was used as a mould or where such simple tools as could be fashioned of clay stone or shell were employed A piece of a gourd was sometimes held against the inner wall to support it while the outer surface was being scraped and smoothed with these rude tools The bottom of the piece was formed either from a small lump of clay patted and moulded into proper shape by the fingers or with the end of a clay strip which was coiled around on itself In whichever way the bottom was begun the walls were made of coils of clay The ancient Cliff Dwellers or Pueblos used this method very skilfully Their strips of clay were cut and coiled with great exactness and the edges overlapping on the outside made spiral markings There are no evidences of anything like the potter s wheel the nearest approach being the basket mould which was probably turned with one hand as the coil of clay was applied with the other The markings of cords and weaving which are often seen on the outer surfaces of Indian pots and vases were probably made by pliable fabrics which were used to support the piece as it was formed Woven textures were also wrapped over the hand or a tool to impress the wet clay and cords wound about paddles or other tools made similar impressions In some cases the outer surface was rubbed smooth with the fingers and thumb or with a stone in others the coil structure is plainly seen After the body of the piece was finished the rim was perfected and the handles legs or other parts in relief were applied These were made separately and were attached by pressure and rubbing In decoration the potters of each tribe had different ideas as well as tools and devices for working them out The fingers and nails were used to produce certain effects and tools of various kinds were made for special purposes pointed ones for incising gouge like tools to scrape away the clay and all kinds of stamps for impressed designs Some of the stamps were in paddle form such as we use for making butter balls others were thin disks with indented edges which were rolled over the soft clay surface Incised designs were perhaps the most usual though colour was often employed in decorating the ware Especially was this the case in the Pueblo country and in Arkansas The colours were white brown red and black and they were mostly powdered clay sometimes mixed with ochres The surface of the piece first received a wash of fine paste and afterward the colours ground fine and mixed with water were applied with the finger or a piece of reed grass The designs were generally made by the women Circles and curved designs were most used probably because they could be made with such freedom in contrast to the slow and painstaking process of weaving right angled designs into baskets Illustration FIG The pottery was dried in the shade in the sun or before the fire and afterward baked more or less thoroughly Some tribes the Catawbas for example simply baked their ware before the fire while others covered the pieces with burning bark or other fuel surrounding them evenly with it inside and out The pieces were protected from contact with each other by broken pieces of pottery They were carefully kept from draughts during the firing and the first part of the cooling for fear of cracking Among the Cherokees a glossy black was given to the inner surface of the pottery by what was known as smother firing When the process of baking just described was completed the vessel was turned bottom up over a small hole in the ground which had been filled with burning corncobs From time to time the fuel was renewed until in half an hour the inside of the piece had become glistening black Illustration FIG It is to be regretted that among the Indians this art like that of basketry is passing The coming of civilisation has brought iron and tin cooking vessels and ordinary tableware to take the place of the bowls platters and cups the jars and bottles of clay so full of individual charm Not only to the collector and the student of ethnology is Indian pottery of value the potter of to day finds much that is helpful and suggestive in primitive processes as well as in the forms and decoration Illustration FIG A study of the range of shapes and designs in Indian pottery is a revelation to many who have thought of the Indian as an ignorant savage Aside from its beauty and decorative value the uses to which Indian pottery can be put in our homes are many The great bowl shown in the plate suggests one delightful way of utilising this ware Foliage plants of any size from a tiny cactus which seems to find a bowl with a rounded base the most comfortable of abiding places to a great spreading fern harmonise with the Indian colours So will flowering plants except those which have red pink or purple blossoms and what a relief these plant bowls are to the eye after some of the jardini res one sees Illustration INDIAN POTTERY On the right is a piece of pottery in terra cotta and black made by a Pima Indian Beside it is a dish with a handle moulded by a Zia Indian of New Mexico The bowl is also of Zia ware On the left is a water jug such as the Maricopa Indians make Large bowls are useful too for holding fruit on the porch of a country house while smaller ones serve as nut bowls Low plaque shaped pieces make excellent card trays and the small bowls hold matches There are curious little pieces in the form of shoes made by the Indians of New Mexico These also are useful for matches or cigar ashes see Fig Last and least though only in size is the toy pottery money banks in the form of well fed pigs whistles and toy dishes cups jugs and plates bewitching alike to little girls and big A few of them are shown in Figs and They are Indian red and creamy yellow in colour with designs of black and rarely are two of them alike Fashions change in pottery as well as in other things and freakish forms which please us to day may be ridiculed to morrow but primitive wares have an enduring value Pieces that were moulded for service by potters whose love for nature and its beauties must needs express itself even on the decoration of a cooking pot will last long after the ware that is made only for money has gone back to the ground from whence it came Modern American Pottery CHAPTER XII MODERN AMERICAN POTTERY One of the most encouraging signs of the advance in taste among American people is to be found in their appreciation of the pottery which is now being made in this country Time was when majolica jardini res and Austrian china with their high colours and glassy glazes were things to be desired Happily they are going the way of plush covered suites of furniture and crazy quilts Much of the simplicity of method and design in American pottery comes from the study of primitive processes shapes and decorations Indian ware though of less value than some others to the student of ceramics on account of its softness of body and unglazed surface is nevertheless full of artistic feeling and suggestion to makers of pottery There are many evidences also of French and Japanese influence In various parts of the country true art pottery is being made each ware with its own individuality and more or less characteristic of the section of the country from whence it comes As yet but little tableware has been attempted at these potteries the Dedham being almost the only one where it is made Modern pottery is either moulded by hand thrown on the potter s wheel or cast in moulds After it has been formed it is generally decorated either by the artist potter himself or by some young man or woman who has learned design as applied to pottery The decoration is either painted with colours which have been mixed with clays like some of the Rookwood ware or incised modelled in relief or built up as the Volkmar pottery After it is quite dry the pot is fired in the great kiln this time without glazing or in the biscuit It is then glazed and fired for the second time The philosophical potter and every potter needs philosophy will not despair if in the second firing the piece is not satisfactory He glazes it again with every care in time for the next firing and is often rewarded by having this ugly duckling of one kiln turn out the swan of the next Among the pioneers of art pottery in this country was Mrs Maria Longworth Storer a Cincinnati woman who in opened a pottery called by the name of her father s place Rookwood Mrs Storer had in addition to an artistic temperament the patience and determination as well as the financial resources necessary to such an undertaking The first kiln of the new pottery was drawn on Thanksgiving Day By the pottery had become self supporting Rookwood has always been a distinctively American pottery From the first native clays were used and their possibilities were discovered with the firing of each new kiln Clays that fire at a comparatively low heat were used at first and this necessitated employing the soft glazes Later the yellow or Rockingham ware formed the body of the pieces and now a creamy white body is used which produces a strong and beautiful pottery This is finished with a mat glaze At first the tint of the native clay inclined the colour scheme to warm browns yellows and reds This ware was decorated with flower or figure designs under a brilliant glaze It is known as Standard Rookwood The Tiger Eye and Goldstone are other wares with glaze effects not unlike the Standard Rookwood Both of these have dark grounds with an occasional luminous gleam of gold one of the interesting accidents of the kiln Other varieties of Rookwood in the order of their development were Sea Green in which an opalescent green effect is sometimes relieved with a touch of yellow or red and Iris which has the creamy white body already referred to This enables the potter to produce gray tones in his glazes In Rookwood which is coated with the flowing glaze there is a quality not unlike some of the old Chinese wares It has a richness of texture luminous and beautiful The decorations are painted in relief so simply that the glaze flows charmingly over them There is also a variety of the Rookwood pottery with a mat glaze In this the process is entirely different from that used in making the other kinds of Rookwood The glaze is of the greatest importance the forms are simple sometimes almost rugged and the decorations are subordinate There are even pieces entirely undecorated which depend upon their beauty of colour and texture alone Decorations adapted from Indian designs are often modelled in relief or incised Occasionally metals are applied Mantels wall panels drinking fountains and architectural reliefs are also made of the Rookwood faience Illustration FIG Many are the potters marks that have been used at Rookwood Before there were eight in all At that time the mark shown in Fig was adopted This was used with the addition of a flame mark for every succeeding year until when the mark was like Fig Since that date a Roman numeral has been added below the mark according to the year the piece was made For example the pieces of the present year have the Roman number IV below the mark used in Illustration FIG A comparatively near neighbour of Rookwood is the Gates pottery near Chicago where Teco ware is made The potter s love for his work and the potter s zeal to produce something more perfect and beautiful than he had ever done before led William D Gates who had long made terra cotta for architectural purposes to experiment with clays and glazes until finally Teco ware was evolved It is a hard durable pottery built on simple lines Western artists and architects of note have contributed designs and forms for this ware and for the most part the pieces are beautiful and restful to the eye The few incised or moulded decorations are not made prominent but are suggested rather than sharply defined Over all is a mat glaze of soft wax like texture in green the green that makes one think of weathered bronze Set in a picturesque valley surrounded by flowers and near a little lake the Gates potteries are so situated as to inspire the artist potters who mould the forms and decorate the ware It has been the aim of the makers of Teco pottery to produce a ware that shall be satisfying and beautiful and yet of comparatively slight cost Illustration TECO WARE It is a far journey from these potteries to the three New England cities where are the Grueby Dedham and Merrimac potteries Grueby ware which was first made in Boston in is remarkable for the glaze which was discovered by Mr William H Grueby Although for many years dull finished pottery has been produced by sand blasting ware with a glossy finish or by taking a piece of glazed pottery and treating it with acid to make it dull the Grueby potteries were the first in the history of ceramics to make a dull finished pottery in their kilns The surface thus obtained has a deep velvety look unlike any other finish made such as that which was possessed by old Corean pottery The ware was first exhibited in Paris in where it made quite a sensation and the French Government awarded the Grueby Potteries a gold medal for enamels and glazes as well as a silver medal for design and gave Mr Grueby personally a gold medal for the work he had accomplished in dull finished enamels The forms are simple and good and the decorations which are incised or modelled in relief are planned so that the glaze shall flow well over them Common plant forms such as the mullein leaf blades of grass plantain and the enfolding leaves of the lily are the motives for these designs There is a delicacy one might almost say a reserve in their treatment that is rare and very interesting The pottery is hard and the glaze such as is applicable to a ware which fires at a great heat The colours of Grueby pottery are beautiful and rich ranging from an old ivory tint to golden yellows russet browns and velvety blues and a variety of green shades The texture of the glaze is soft like the bloom of a melon and it has an unusual network of markings No moulds are used in making this pottery it is all thrown on the wheel and as in the old wares no two pieces are exactly alike Besides its beauty and artistic value the fact that the Grueby pottery is made in forms that are useful makes it doubly desirable Among lamp jars particularly there is the greatest variety These are made both for oil and electricity In the Grueby Tiffany lamp two charming products of applied arts are combined the jar being Grueby ware and the leaded or blown glass shade of Tiffany design and workmanship The Dedham pottery is remarkable for many reasons chief among them being the fact that it is as already stated almost the only place in this country where art tableware is made Some of this ware which is popularly known as the Bunny china has lifelike little rabbits on the border other pieces have designs of ducks and others still have borders of fruit The wonderful Oriental glazes that are used on pieces of Dedham ware were re discovered by Mr Hugh C Robertson The best known glaze of this pottery however is the gray crackle ware with designs of blue At the Merrimac pottery in Newburyport an excellent ware is made A few of the pieces are moulded but the majority are thrown on the potter s wheel Little decoration is used the charm of the ware being its form and colour Among the most remarkable of the artist potters of this country is Mr Charles Volkmar of the Volkmar Kilns in Metuchen New Jersey An artist to his finger tips he has a potter s thumb which is the envy of all those who were less evidently born to the craft Mr Volkmar studied not only art but his craft as well in Paris wearing the blouse of a workman in the potteries where he learned so admirably how to work in clay that there are few in this country who approach him The ware made by Mr Volkmar and his son Mr Leon Volkmar is remarkable for the simple beauty of its forms and for the quality of its glazes The body of the ware is pale yellow and it is exceedingly hard and durable Years ago Mr Volkmar made a fine blue and white ware which was decorated with historical scenes His pieces now are for the most part finished with a mat glaze although some have a glossy transparent surface All are beautiful in colour Here is where the artist shows preeminently The deep rich texture of the mat glaze softens but does not hide the simple incised or built up designs The pierced designs of Volkmar pottery are decorative and strong This ware is as practical to use as it is charming to look at The flower jars are in tones that harmonise delightfully with the blossoms that fill them and the jugs have flowing and graceful lines and yet are substantial and of generous proportions The plate shows a few pieces of this ware The piece on the left is a pale yellowish brown with a glossy finish this is suitable for a lamp bowl or for flowers Beside it is a sturdy little mug with a deep green mat glaze The next jar is finished with a dull blue transparent glaze and the taller vase shaped piece on the right has a mat glaze of pale gray green Not far from the Volkmar Kilns at Woodbridge New Jersey is the Poillon pottery where garden ware is made Great tree and plant tubs sun dial stands well curbs and window ledge boxes are a few of the things that come from this pottery The forms of these pieces are substantial and good Some excellent indoor pottery is also moulded candlesticks toilet sets jugs and flower bowls a host of useful and attractive shapes coated with a flowing glaze The ware is finished in a variety of colours yellow being one of the most successful The Poillon potteries have designed special earthenware for country clubs lamps toilet sets ashtrays match bowls all uniform in colour and design and each specially adapted in form to the use for which it is intended Illustration SOME PIECES OF VOLKMAR POTTERY The work of the Brush Guild of New York is more like Indian pottery than any other of the American wares The pieces all have a hand moulded look and the few designs are quite primitive in their simplicity The glossy black finish suggests Indian smother firing It is not unlike the black pottery which the Santa Clara Indians make and the great generous pieces are also suggestive of this ware Unlike any Indian pottery however the bowls and jars of the Brush Guild will hold water perfectly From the far South comes an exceedingly interesting ware this is the Newcomb pottery made by the students of Newcomb College New Orleans It may be seen at exhibitions of arts and crafts guilds here in the North The ware originated in the art department of Newcomb College Here for years teachers of drawing and painting had been educated but it began to be manifest that with the lack of other fields for art workers this department could not be widely useful The establishment of a pottery was the practical solution of this difficulty Many young women have found in the making of this pottery an artistic vocation from which they reap profit and reputation The aim of the originators from the first has been to make a ware that would be individual one that should have a charm all its own This has been accomplished by taking as motives for the designs the unusual and beautiful Southern flowers plants and trees as well as the animal life of that part of the country A charming pitcher has a design of snow drops painted in cream white slip on a yellow gray background Another piece has a decoration of fishes and on still another a high slender flower jar stalks of the sugar cane form the design The methods of decoration are incising painting and modelling used together or singly according to the requirements of the design Great freedom is allowed in the choice of colour as well as in the decoration each worker feeling the responsibility attached to a signed piece of pottery Some of the ware is undecorated save for the unexpected touches of the kiln which give charming and unusual effects Illustration A PIECE OF NEWCOMB POTTERY The mark shown in Fig distinguishes the Newcomb pottery and only those pieces receive it which are approved by the art department Illustration FIG Individual work of merit is being produced every year in this country and it will not be long before the solitary potter of to day moulding his pieces and testing his glazes in some little workshop like a brown chrysalis will perfect his ware so that the tiny workshop will expand into a great building and another beautiful ware will be added to modern American pottery END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOW TO MAKE POTTERY Updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will

CHAPTER I PLAYING TRUANT I declare Frank it is time we were off It is almost nine o clock I wish to goodness there were no such things as school houses and school books in the world I am not going to school to day You re not No sir I m going to take French leave Do you mean that you are going to run away I suppose that is what you country fellows call it Well now you had better take a friend s advice and think twice before you do that You ll get yourself into trouble sure The rule of our school is that you must bring a written excuse every time you are absent That was the rule of our school in Boston too but it didn t keep the fellows from staying away whenever they felt like it Where did you get your excuses We wrote them ourselves and signed our father s name to them that s the way we got them You can t fool our teacher that way He knows our hand writing too well He knows yours too by this time I can disguise it so that he ll not recognize it I bet you Don t let s go Leon I am heartily sick of school and everything connected with it So am I Then suppose we spend the day in the woods The conversation above recorded took place one gloomy autumn morning between Leon Parker and his city cousin Frank Fuller They were about sixteen years of age and were bright honest looking boys but one of them at least was just the opposite of what he appeared to be Leon Parker lived in the little town of Eaton in one of our Northern States His father was a practising lawyer and the boy was given every opportunity to prepare himself for usefulness in after life But Leon was too indolent to study and the consequence was that he always stood at the foot of his class and saw boys younger than himself carry off the honors he might have won if he had been willing to work for them Leon was not such a boy as you would have chosen for a companion He was cross and overbearing and his father was often obliged to take him to task for some of his misdeeds This always made him very angry Other boys seemed to get on without having the least trouble with their parents or anybody else and Leon finally came to the conclusion that his father was a tyrant and that he would be much happier if he could go so far away from him that he would never see him again And yet there were a good many boys in Eaton who would have been glad to change places with him While his father insisted that he should behave himself he was at the same time very indulgent and he had supplied Leon with a good many things which the majority of the boys in Eaton regarded as necessary to their happiness He owned a beautiful little skiff a jointed bass rod and a light fowling piece He had ample opportunity to use them too The country about the village was hilly almost mountainous the woods and thickets were dense and grouse quails and gray and black squirrels could be bagged any day without the slightest trouble Foxes were more abundant than the neighboring farmers wished they were deer were shot within sight of the court house every winter and now and then a bear or wildcat was seen among the hills In summer the river which flowed in front of the village offered black and rock bass pike and perch In the fall it was visited by thousands of wild ducks which stopped there to rest during their migrations and some of them were so well satisfied with the feeding grounds they found there that they remained all winter The most of the boys in Eaton thought it was a nice place to live but Leon as we have said was very discontented and matters were made worse by the arrival of his cousin Frank Fuller who was sent to Eaton because he could not be managed at home It was understood among the boys to whom he had been introduced that he had come there for the purpose of attending the high school of which the village boasted and indeed his father s instructions were that he was not to miss a single day He had been there just two weeks and now he was talking of playing truant Mr Parker already regretted that he had consented to receive his nephew into his house He began to fear that his influence over Leon would be anything but beneficial He had already detected him in numberless falsehoods and had discovered that in spite of his apparent frankness he was as sneaking and sly as a boy could possibly be And Frank too was sorry that he had ever come to Eaton He was disgusted with the quiet life he led at his uncle s house and heartily wished himself back in Boston Let s go up on the hill and look at these snares you told me about the other day continued Frank We may find a partridge or two in them That s so exclaimed Leon I never should have thought of them again But it will be awful slow walking about the woods all day without our guns Oh we ll take them with us But how can we carry them downstairs and out of the house without being seen by somebody We ll do it you may depend upon that answered Frank as he disappeared in a closet opening off the room in which he and his cousin slept When he came out again he carried a light silver mounted rifle in one hand and a game bag and powder horn in the other We must have something to eat too It gives one a fearful appetite to climb over these hills You go and get the lunch just as if we were going to school and then come out to the barn and you will find me there with the guns To this Leon silently assented and went into the closet after his hunting accoutrements which he handed over to Frank While the latter was slinging the game bag and the powder and shot flasks over his shoulders Leon opened the door and ran downstairs In the hall he met his mother I was just coming to call you said she You boys will be late at school if you do not make haste Your lunch is all ready We re just going to start said Leon But not for school We have had quite enough of that he added to himself as he hurried through the hall and turned into the kitchen Cramming the lunch into his pocket he slipped out of the back door and ran toward the barn When Leon reached the barn he found Frank waiting for him He had watched his opportunity and as soon as his aunt went out of the hall he descended the stairs opened the front door and made his way around the house to the place of meeting Give me my game bag and I will put the lunch into it We are all right so far he said with a look of relief Oh there s nothing to be alarmed about answered Frank as he unslung the game bag from his shoulder and handed it to his cousin If you had been in such scrapes as often as I have you would think nothing of it Perhaps not but I almost wish I had gone to school said Leon honestly What will become of us when father finds out that we have played hookey That s what bothers me It needn t bother you for he s not going to find it out was Frank s encouraging reply We ll enjoy ourselves in the woods for a day or two and then we ll go back to our Latin and geometry again I ll write the excuse Don t spoil a good day s sport by worrying over that Having put the lunch in his game bag Leon slung it over his shoulder picked up his gun and opening a back door struck out across a wide field that lay between the barn and the nearest piece of woods closely followed by his cousin They walked rapidly looking back now and then to make sure that they were keeping the barn between themselves and the house and it was not until they had climbed the fence and plunged into the woods that Leon felt safe from discovery Then he drew a long breath of satisfaction and slackened his pace If I stood as much in fear of my father as you do of yours I wouldn t stay with him said Frank who seemed to be perfectly at his ease I d run away from him It was right on the point of Leon s tongue to tell his cousin that he had long ago resolved to do that very thing but he didn t say it for he was not sure that it would be quite safe to trust Frank with his secret I have often thought I should like to go out West and live as those hunters and trappers do continued Frank Wouldn t it be jolly to have a snug cabin somewhere in the mountains and nothing to do but attend to your traps every day and hunt the big game that is so abundant out there This very thought had often suggested itself to Leon s lively imagination and he had made up his mind that some day he would live in just that way I shall see that country before long Frank went on Father is going to California on business next year and he has promised that if I will behave myself while I am here in Eaton he will take me with him If I like the looks of things as well as I think I shall you ll never see me among civilized people again Will you stay out there and become a hunter asked Leon Yes sir But what would you say to your father I shouldn t say anything to him When I found a place that suited me I would slip away from him and let him come home without me But you have lived in the city all your life and what do you know about the Western country I could learn all about it couldn t I I am a pretty good shot with a rifle and I should try to work myself in somewhere as post hunter Others have done it and I don t see why I couldn t What is a post hunter asked Leon Why he is a man whose business it is to keep the garrison supplied with fresh meat If the soldiers go out on an expedition to explore the country or hunt Indians he goes with them and shoots all the game they want to eat He is regularly employed and paid by the government If I couldn t get a position like that I d hunt buffaloes for their hides Why only the other day I read in the paper that one old hunter out there had killed twelve hundred buffaloes in a single season He sold their skins for a dollar apiece too Twelve hundred dollars a year exclaimed Leon Oh some of them make more than that And then just think of the fun they have Leon had often thought of that very thing and he had thought of it in school when his mind ought to have been fully occupied with his books Nothing suited him better than to ramble all day over the hills with his double barrel in his hands making double shots at the game birds with which the woods abounded He generally spent every Saturday during the hunting season in this way and he had finally come to believe that he would rather do that than anything else The only drawback to his enjoyment was that when the day drew to a close the hunt came to an end and he was obliged to go home That was a place where he never saw any pleasure especially in the evening His father was always deeply engrossed with his paper his mother was busy with her needle and until Frank came Leon had no one to whom he could safely confide his secret hopes and longings When he became a hunter with a nice little cabin of his own in some secluded valley where game of all kinds was abundant things would be very different he often told himself After he had spent the day in attending to his traps and fighting with the grizzlies he would return to his snug harbor well loaded with the spoils of the chase and while his venison steaks and corn bread were turning to a crisp brown under the influence of a cheerful fire he would recline at his ease upon a pile of soft buffalo robes and think over the events of the day while he listened to the howling of the wolves and the sifting of the snow upon the roof of his cabin Leon always grew excited when this agreeable picture arose before his mental vision and he longed for the day when the dream would become a reality Frank as may be supposed had a good deal to say about the joys of a hunter s life and while he talked and Leon listened they pushed their way rapidly through the woods and finally after crossing several deep ravines and climbing two or three fences they found themselves on Mr Parker s hill farm where Leon had set his snares The latter led the way toward the thicket in which the snares had been placed and when he reached it he stopped suddenly dropped the butt of his gun to the ground and uttered an exclamation indicative of great rage and astonishment What s the matter asked Frank Why just look at that and tell me if you ever heard of a more contemptible trick exclaimed Leon Frank looked but could discover nothing to excite his cousin s anger All he saw was a low fence built of twigs which stretched away on each side of him as far as his eyes could reach At intervals of a dozen feet or more were little openings about six inches wide and it was in these openings that the snares had been set The last time Leon was there the snares were all in perfect order and ready to catch any luckless grouse or hare which might attempt to pass through the openings before spoken of But now there was not a single snare to be seen The strings of which they were made had all been removed It s the meanest piece of business I ever heard of continued Leon backing toward a fallen log and seating himself upon it That meddlesome Oscar Preston has been up here and destroyed all my work I wish I could get within reach of him for about two minutes I d teach him to mind his own business Leon struck his open palm with his clenched hand and looked very savage indeed CHAPTER II THE BUSHWHACKERS Who is Oscar Preston asked Frank as he seated himself on the log beside his cousin Oh he s the village pot hunter Leon answered throwing as much contempt into his tones as he could Pot hunter repeated Frank Yes He s a market shooter He doesn t hunt game for the fun of it as you and I and all other decent fellows do but he does it to make money out of it He is too lazy to earn a living in any respectable way and besides as he comes of a dishonest family no one in town will employ him You see he and his brother used to work in Smith Anderson s grocery store Oscar was one of the clerks and his brother was book keeper and cashier Just before you came here his brother disappeared all of a sudden and has never been heard of since After he was gone his books were examined and it was found that he was a defaulter to the amount of three thousand dollars Smith Anderson didn t like that very well and believing that if there was one thief in the Preston family there might be another they thought it was best to give Oscar his walking papers Does he make any money by shooting for the market asked Frank I should say he did There is a mortgage of five hundred dollars on his mother s place his father is dead you know and Oscar has paid off a hundred dollars of it since he left the store He s got a leaky old scow a double barrel blunderbuss that you and I wouldn t pick up in the street and a half starved hound The scow he uses for hunting ducks on the river and with the hound he runs foxes and rabbits When summer comes I suppose he will fish all the time He can catch black bass where nobody else would ever think of looking for them and he can sell every one of them for ten cents a pound But what right had he to destroy your snares He had no right to do it for he is not game constable What sort of a constable is that asked Frank Why you know there is a law in this State which says that game shall not be shot except at certain seasons of the year and a game constable is a man whose business it is to see that the law is obeyed It is against the law to trap partridges and quails and if we had a game constable in town I shouldn t have set these snares for I should have rendered myself liable to prosecution but the office is vacant now for there was no one elected to fill it last year I think Oscar was taking a good deal upon himself said Frank So do I and the reason he did it was because every partridge or rabbit that I catch leaves just one less for him to shoot for market But these are my father s grounds and I shall give him to understand the first time I meet him that I want him to keep away from here You and I can shoot all the birds there are in these woods I wouldn t take the trouble to say a word to him replied Frank I d pay him back in his own coin If he wouldn t let me snare birds I wouldn t let him hunt foxes Do you ever see that hound of his running about the woods Oh yes I often see him Well the next time you put eyes on him just bushwhack him and send a charge of shot into him I can do that can t I exclaimed Leon growing excited at once But what if Oscar should find it out he added after he had taken a second thought Very likely he will find it out He will know that somebody has shot his hound when he finds him dead won t he But I mean suppose he should find out that I did it I don t see how he can do it The hound if he is following a trail will probably be some distance in advance of his master and all you ve got to do is to knock him over and dig out It isn t at all probable that Oscar will ever find out who did the shooting but if he does you can tell him that you did it to square accounts with him for destroying your snares I d like to do it but it would be sure to raise a storm in the village said Leon shaking his head in a very significant manner All the folks used to like that boy and he s got a good many friends yet Then show me the hound and I ll shoot him said Frank impatiently I thought you had more pluck I am not afraid of that fellow or his friends either Now let s set these snares again and go on and see if we can find some birds But in the first place explain one thing to me What did you build that fence for To stop any rabbit or partridge who might come this way answered Leon I shouldn t think it would stop them They could easily jump over it for it isn t much more than a foot high But they won t do it said Leon Whenever they come to an obstruction of this kind they never attempt to cross it that is they are not alarmed but run along by the side of it to find some way to get through or around it When they reach one of these openings they try to squeeze through it and that is the time they get caught Now I ll show you how the snares are set Leon placed his gun against the log on which he was sitting and producing a piece of fine strong twine from one of the pockets of his game bag he made a running noose in one end of it The other he fastened securely to a small hickory sapling which grew near one of the openings in the fence This done he bent the sapling over and placed the noose in the opening and confined it there with a short notched stick which he cut from a neighboring bush Then in order to show his cousin how the snare operated he pushed the notched stick out of its place by giving it a gentle tap with his finger whereupon the sapling straightened itself up with a jerk and the running noose was fastened firmly about his wrist Oh I see exclaimed Frank When a bird or rabbit tries to pass through one of these little gates he knocks out the stick and is pulled up by the neck before he knows what is the matter with him That is just the way the thing works replied Leon and the noose is drawn together so quickly when the sapling flies back to its place that nothing can get out of the way of it Nine times in ten when you find one of your snares sprung you will find game in it Give me some of that string and I ll help you set them said Frank leaning his rifle against the log beside his cousin s double barrel I know how it is done now The boys had a good hour s work before them The fence was nearly a hundred yards long there were a good many openings in it and the person who destroyed the snares whoever he was had made sure work of it He had not only carried off all the strings and thrown away the notched sticks but in some places he had broken down the saplings to which the strings were tied Leon had a good many hard things to say about Oscar while he was engaged in repairing damages and when he found how completely all his care and patient labor had been undone by the despised market shooter he grew angrier than ever All the foxes he catches with that hound this winter he can carry in one of his vest pockets declared Leon as he trimmed the branches off a sapling with his knife The very first time I get within range of him I ll fill him so full of holes that he will answer for a window I don t care if Oscar sees me when I do it either At length the repairs were all completed and the snares were set in readiness to snatch up anything in the way of small game that might chance to come within their reach The work had given Frank an appetite and he proposed that they should go further back in the woods shoot a couple of squirrels if they could not find any birds roast them over a fire and eat them with their lunch His cousin readily falling in with the idea they shouldered their guns and before setting out turned to take a survey of their work and make sure that nothing had been left undone At that moment the bugle like notes of a hound rang through the woods There he is now exclaimed Leon in great excitement Isn t it lucky Keep perfectly quiet until we find out which way he is going Are you sure that is the dog you want to see asked Frank Of course I am There s not another hound about the village If he comes in sight of us you will see that he is a large tan colored animal with ears like an elephant s Everybody says he is just splendid He has brought his owner many a dollar to go toward paying off that mortgage but I ll bet he ll not bring him many more if I get a fair chance at him Again the deep toned bay rang out on the frosty air awakening a thousand echoes among the hills and this time it sounded nearer than before The hound had evidently struck a warm trail and Leon told his cousin in a suppressed whisper that the trail led directly toward them A few seconds and even the inexperienced Frank became satisfied of this fact The hound now gave tongue almost continuously the melodious notes grew louder every moment and presently a rustling in the bushes told the boys that he was close at hand and coming nearer with every bound Leon cocked one barrel of his gun planted his feet firmly upon the ground and just then a hound which answered to the description he had given to his cousin except in one particular emerged from the thicket He ran along with his nose close to the ground wagging his tail vigorously and so intent was he upon his work that he did not immediately discover the boys When he did become aware of their presence however he merely lifted his head long enough to give one look at them and then took up his trail again He was not at all afraid of them Bugle that was the name of the hound knew everybody in the village and everybody knew him and liked him too That is the last trail you will ever follow my four footed friend Leon exclaimed as he raised his gun to his shoulder and waited for the animal to come out from behind a fallen log which just at that moment concealed him from view Mind what you are doing Frank whispered laying his hand upon his cousin s arm That isn t the dog you want Yes it is was Leon s reply Why you said Oscar s hound was half starved and this one is as plump as a quail protested Frank I guess I know what I am about answered Leon impatiently He shook off his cousin s hand drew his gun closer to his face and just then the hound came in sight around the end of the log Leon took a quick aim at his head and pulled the trigger There was a commotion among the leaves a howl of anguish and when the smoke cleared away the boys saw Bugle running at full speed through the woods yelping loudly at every jump He was out of sight in an instant There exclaimed Leon Go and hunt up your master and tell him to keep his hands off my snares in future Let s dig out said Frank hastily Oscar can t be far away and you don t want him to find you here No Leon had not the slightest desire to meet Bugle s master after what he had done He had talked very glibly about teaching Oscar to mind his own business if he could only get within reach of him for a few minutes but he knew very well that that was something he could not do Oscar was a young athlete even if he was nothing but a market shooter Although he was a few months younger than Leon he was a good deal larger and stronger and it would have been no trouble at all for him to take Leon by the collar with one hand and Frank with the other and give them both a hearty shaking Probably Leon was afraid he would do it if he caught them for he lost no time in acting upon his cousin s suggestion to dig out He ran so swiftly that he very soon left Frank behind and the latter who was quickly out of breath begged him to hold up What makes you take to this rough ground panted Frank as he toiled up a high hill which his cousin had climbed in his rapid flight Because the woods are thicker up here and afford us better hiding places was Leon s answer Well there s no need that we should run ourselves to death said Frank as he seated himself on a huge bowlder and drew his handkerchief across his forehead and I ll not go another step There s no need of it for we are safe now It is lucky there is no snow on the ground for if there was Oscar could follow us all day We ll have a few minutes rest and then we ll see if we can shoot something for our dinner Leon took his seat upon another bowlder a short distance away and during the ten minutes he remained there he never said a word to his cousin The latter did not speak to him either Frank had no breath to waste in words and Leon was busy with his own thoughts He was by no means proud of the act he had just performed He was a bad boy but he was not wholly depraved and his conscience smote him when he reflected that he had in a moment of anger deprived an industrious hard working youth of almost the only means he had of earning a livelihood and keeping a roof over the head of his widowed mother He knew very well that the ambitious and high spirited Oscar was not a market shooter from choice He followed the business for the same reason that a good many others follow a business they do not like because he could find nothing else to do and he was not the one to stand idly by and see his mother suffer for the want of the necessaries of life Father says he deserves a good deal of credit and that there isn t one boy in a thousand who would do as well as he has done thought Leon and then he grew angry again What do I care for what father says he added mentally He is always ready to praise other boys while for me he has nothing but scowls and cross words I am glad I killed that old hound and I am only sorry that Oscar hadn t got a dozen so that I could shoot them all He needn t think he owns all the birds in the country simply because he makes a living by shooting them for market Are you rested now Frank If you are we ll go on The young hunters did not have far to look to find the dinner of which they were in search The squirrels were busy gathering their winter s supply of nuts and on almost the first hickory tree they saw they found three plump little fellows and bagged them all two falling to Leon s double barrel and the other coming down with one of Frank s bullets through his head As soon as they had secured their game Leon led the way to the bottom of the deep ravine where they found a stream of water beside which they built their fire The squirrels were roasted on forked sticks over the flames and when the bones had all been picked clean and the last morsel of the lunch had disappeared the truants stretched themselves at full length beside the fire and listened to the howling of the wind which shook the leafless branches of the trees on the summit of the hills above them and watched the little flakes of snow that now and then found their way into the ravine The snow storm that all the weather wise people in the village had been predicting for several days past was now raging above their heads but it did not reach them in their sheltered camp for the thick screen of evergreens which lined the foot of the high hills on both sides of the stream effectually protected them from its fury It is of no use to think of hunting as long as it snows and blows like this said Leon so we may as well stay here I was just thinking of something said Frank Suppose we had found your snares all in order and a partridge or rabbit in each one of them What would we have done with the game It wouldn t have been safe to take it home with us Of course it wouldn t answered Leon We should have exposed ourselves at once What could we have done with it I never thought of that before but there s one thing I have been thinking about all day What are we going to say to father when we go home to night We ll not say anything to him We ll hide our guns in the barn and walk into the house as we do every night when we come from school I wish I needn t go home at all said Leon spitefully I could have enjoyed myself to day if I hadn t been continually haunted by the fear that something is going to happen I declare it is growing dark already What time is it Three o clock replied Frank consulting his watch Is it as late as that cried Leon jumping to his feet Where has the day gone We mustn t stay here a minute longer We have four miles to go and if we are not at home within fifteen minutes after school is dismissed we shall hear of it I tell you Leon noticed that Frank did not appear to be quite so indifferent to the consequences of playing truant as he did when they started out in the morning He sprang to his feet with all haste and after throwing his game bag and powder horn over his shoulder assisted his cousin to put out the fire When this had been done the two boys clambered up the hill and struck out at a rapid walk for the village where a great surprise awaited them CHAPTER III OSCAR AND HIS TROUBLES Preston as soon as you get those goods tied up Mr Smith wants to see you in the office The speaker was Mr Anderson junior partner of the firm of Smith Anderson the leading grocery and dry goods merchants of Eaton and the person addressed was one of the clerks who was engaged in putting up some groceries that had just been ordered by a customer He was a sturdy handsome boy of sixteen years of age and until within a few days had been one of the most cheerful light hearted fellows about the store but he had changed wonderfully of late and the expression of melancholy his face always wore deepened as the junior partner leaned over the counter and whispered these words into his ear Very good sir he replied It has come at last he added to himself as the junior partner walked away I can t say I am surprised for I have been expecting it It is all up with me now I don t care for myself but what will become of mother The clerk s hands trembled as he went on tying up the groceries and when the last article the order book called for had been weighed out and all the bundles had been placed on one end of the counter and marked with the owner s name so that the man who drove the delivery wagon would know where to take them he called all his courage to his aid and walked into the office the door of which was open As he entered a gray headed hard featured man who was sitting on a high stool in front of the desk turned and looked at him over his spectacles Mr Anderson says you want to see me sir said the clerk Yes I sent for you replied the gray headed man There is the money we owe you fifteen dollars We shall not need your services any longer Am I discharged sir asked the boy as he took the bills that were handed him Yes Times are hard and trade dull as you know and we must begin to cut down our expenses You are the youngest clerk in the store and so you must go first May I ask you for a letter of recommendation to assist me in obtaining another situation asked the clerk I am sorry you ask me for it Oscar for I can t consistently give it to you replied Mr Smith The boy seemed to be utterly confounded His face grew pale and red by turns and as soon as he could speak he said with more spirit than his employer had ever seen him exhibit before Then you may as well acknowledge that your plan of cutting down expenses is merely a subterfuge I know why I am dismissed and I think you ought not to hold me responsible for my brother s rascality nor punish me for it I regret it more than you possibly can but I am in no way to blame for it We ll not argue the matter answered Mr Smith turning to his desk and picking up his pen All I have to say to you is that we do not need you any longer And all I have to say to you sir is good day returned the clerk He took his cap from the rack behind the door walked out of the store like one in a dream and turned down the street He went on by the hotel crossed the long bridge that spanned the creek and hurried along the road as if he were trying to leave behind him all recollection of the scene through which he had just passed I can t go home yet he kept saying to himself I haven t the heart to tell mother that I have lost my situation for she has had so much trouble already that it is a wonder how she bears up under it as well as she does For two hours Oscar tore along the road as if he were walking a match against time but fast as he went his gloomy thoughts kept pace with him The wind came down keen and strong from the hills stripping the withered leaves in showers from the shade trees on either side of the road and causing the boy s hands and face to turn to a deep purple but he never knew it He was so completely wrapped up in his troubles that he did not see any of the teams that passed him nor did he hear a single one of the invitations to ride that were shouted at him by the kind hearted farmers He could think of nothing but Mr Smith s refusal to assist him in obtaining another situation and he was only brought to his senses at last by the measured strokes of the town clock which came faintly to his ears followed almost immediately by the shrill whistle of the lock shop Then the boy stopped and looked about him He was standing on the summit of one of the highest hills and the village of Eaton could be dimly seen in the distance It s twelve o clock said he to himself I had no idea it was so late Now I ll go home I must go some time and I might as well go now as an hour later Besides mother will be uneasy if I am not there in time for dinner Let s look this matter squarely in the face and see what is to be done about it Oscar had just found out that he was completely chilled through He buttoned his coat pulled his collar up around his ears thrust his hands deep into his pockets and set out to retrace his steps to the village Oscar Preston could remember the day when he was as popular among the boys of his native town as his father during his life time had been among them Mr Preston had been a contractor and builder and was at one time thought to be well off in the world He owned the house in which he lived and had a small balance at the banker s but one day he fell off the very church whose bell had just aroused Oscar from his reverie receiving injuries which confined him to his bed for more than a year and finally resulted in his death During his long illness his savings rapidly dwindled away and at last he found it necessary to mortgage his home in order to obtain money to support his family and pay his heavy doctors bills At the time this happened Oscar was a student at the high school and his older brother Tom was cashier and book keeper in Smith Anderson s store His salary was small but still he might have saved something to assist his father in his extremity if he had been so inclined Tom however was wholly devoted to himself and cared for nothing but his own pleasure He thought more of horses and good clothes than he did of anything else and his money as fast as he earned it went into the pockets of the tailor and the proprietor of the livery stable Oscar was the only one who could be depended on and he was prompt to do what he could He left school and through the influence of friends obtained a situation as clerk in the same store in which his brother was employed He worked faithfully and every dollar of the pittance he earned was placed in his mother s hands he never spent a cent of it for himself Mr Preston s death was a severe blow to Oscar s mother but she had another hard trial in store for her In less than six months after he died Tom suddenly disappeared taking with him three thousand dollars that did not belong to him He had now been gone two weeks and his employers had just completed the work of examining his accounts During these two weeks a great change had taken place in Oscar He noticed that a good many of the village people who had had a smile or a nod for him in happier days never noticed him now One or two of the clerks in the store would hardly speak to him and at last his employers had discharged him because they were unwilling to allow any of their money to pass through his hands This was the worst part of the whole miserable business Oscar had never told his mother how he was shunned by some of his former friends for she had trouble enough of her own to bear but this was something he could not keep from her Mr Smith has been down on me ever since Tom ran away said Oscar to himself after he had thought the matter over I have seen it plainly enough and if I could only step into another situation somewhere I should be glad to leave him But when I ask a man for work and he wants to know why I was discharged what shall I say That s what hurts me Here you are Oscar exclaimed a cheery voice breaking in upon his meditations It is easier riding than walking Jump in An elegant top buggy drawn by a stylish high stepping horse dashed up beside the boy and the gentleman who was driving drew his reins with one hand while with the other he threw back the heavy lap robe so that the boy could get in It was Mr Parker Leon s father I am obliged to you but I believe I would rather walk was Oscar s reply But I am not going to let you walk said the gentleman almost sternly Jump in here Oscar was forced to smile in spite of himself but it was a sickly smile that did not fail to attract the lawyer s attention Now then he continued after the boy had seated himself by his side and tucked the lap robe about him what brought you so far into the country this cold day without your overcoat and what is the matter with you You look as though you had lost your best friend And so I have Mr Parker replied Oscar sadly Mr Smith gave me my walking papers this morning He did exclaimed the lawyer opening his eyes What reason did he give He says he is going to reduce expenses because times are so hard answered Oscar But I know that there is something back of that for he wouldn t give me a letter of recommendation He wouldn t No sir he wouldn t I asked him for one and he said he couldn t give it to me He has looked crossways at me ever since Tom has been gone He thinks that because my brother abused the confidence the firm placed in him I may abuse it too Whew whistled the lawyer My discharge could not have come at a worse time said Oscar I shall have to make a payment on that mortgage before long and how am I going to do it now that I am thrown out of employment If there were a dozen storekeepers in town who wanted a clerk they would not hire me under the circumstances Mr Parker fastened his eyes upon the little gilt ball on the top of one of the church spires in the distance and made no reply I have been told more than once that old Simpson is a sharper and that I had better look out for him continued Oscar He is always ready to lend money on mortgages to people who he thinks will never be able to repay it and as soon as it becomes due he forecloses and sells them out of house and home He owns a dozen farms about the village and he has got them all in that way When father died he told two or three men in town that he would own our house some day It is worth four thousand dollars with the lot on which it stands and the mortgage is only five hundred The lawyer kept his gaze directed toward the distant spire and said not a word until he drove into the village and reached the street in which Oscar lived Then he drew up beside the curbstone and as the boy was about to get out of the carriage he laid his hand upon his shoulder and said impressively Remember this Oscar Heaven always helps those who help themselves Don t give up Oh I ll never give up was the quick reply There must be something in this town for me to do and if there is I ll find it before I sleep soundly I hope you will believe me Mr Parker when I assure you that I have not done one single thing since I have been in that store that I am unwilling my mother should know I do believe you Oscar said the lawyer encouragingly I have all faith in you Mr Smith may find out one of these days that he has made a great mistake Keep up a good heart and you will come out all right in the end The accents of kindness touched the boy s heart His eyes filled with tears and without stopping to thank the lawyer for his words of cheer he turned about and hurried toward home while Mr Parker reined his horse away from the curbstone and drove on down the street He stopped in front of Smith Anderson s store and made his way into the office where he found the senior partner seated on his high stool busy with his books The two men exchanged greetings made a few remarks concerning the weather and then Mr Parker told the grocer why he had come there I understand that you paid Oscar Preston off this morning said he Now I am somewhat interested in that boy for it was through my influence that he obtained a place in your store and I d like to know what is the matter with him What is he guilty of We haven t been able to fasten any guilt upon him answered Mr Smith We only suspect him Of what asked the visitor Now see here Mr Parker exclaimed the grocer suppose you had a clerk working for you for twenty dollars a month out of which he was obliged to support his mother and pay taxes on a property worth four or five thousand dollars and that clerk should come to your office every day dressed in better clothes than you wear and looking as though he had just come out of some lady s band box what would you think Oho cried the lawyer Because Oscar takes pains to keep himself as neat as a new pin you suspect him of till tapping do you I can set your fears on that score at rest In the first place his mother makes all his clothes and the boy has no tailor s bills to pay In the next place I have known him to make more money in a single week in a little work shop he s got at home than you paid him for a month s services He is the most expert taxidermist I ever saw I have a case of birds in my house now for which I paid him forty dollars If he is making money as fast as that why can t he keep his hands out of my drawer demanded the grocer Do you mean to tell me that he has been stealing exclaimed Mr Parker I mean to tell you that somebody has been stealing was the reply Perhaps it was Tom A young man who will make false entries in his books would not be above taking money out of the drawer No it wasn t Tom We have missed money since he went away I don t see how you can look into Oscar s face and think him dishonest said Mr Parker who was very much surprised I would suspect any of your clerks before I would suspect him Well I wouldn t They have all been with me for a number of years and I have never seen anything wrong with them I watch my clerks pretty closely too Then I don t suppose it would be of any use for me to ask you to take Oscar back said the lawyer as he rose and drew on his gloves It would be of no use whatever was the prompt and decided reply I can t trust him and I don t want him to touch any more of my money I am certain that some of it has stuck to his fingers That settles the matter But mark my words You will one day discover that you have done that boy very great injustice Good day sir If I do I shall make him all the reparation in my power said the grocer Good day Mr Parker The lawyer was disappointed but he was not discouraged He did not get into his carriage again immediately but walked the whole length of the business portion of the street entering several stores and calling upon some of his professional friends He had a good word to say for the discharged clerk wherever he stopped and the result was made apparent that very afternoon Meanwhile Oscar all unconscious of the efforts that were being put forth in his behalf was making all haste to reach home It was long past the dinner hour and he knew that his mother would wonder at his absence She opened the door for him as he stepped upon the porch and although he tried to smile and look as cheerful and happy as usual she saw in a moment that there was something the matter with him CHAPTER IV THE YOUNG TAXIDERMIST What is it Oscar said Mrs Preston while an expression of anxiety settled on her pale face Oscar what has happened Nothing much mother replied the boy I am discharged That s all Is dinner ready O Oscar exclaimed his mother It s a fact Mr Smith wants to bring down his expenses and as I was the youngest clerk of course I had to go He said nothing about the grocer s refusal to give him the letter of recommendation for which he had applied That was his own trouble and he would not burden his mother with it Don t look so sober We have funds enough in the bank to support us for a few months and there are fifteen dollars more he added handing out the money he had received from Mr Smith But you know we were saving that to make the first payment on the mortgage said Mrs Preston anxiously Yes I know and perhaps we will use it for that purpose yet I shall start out as soon as I get something to eat and hunt up a situation Is dinner ready I have brought home a good appetite And Oscar thought he had But when he found himself seated at the table in the cosey little dining room with a substantial and well cooked dinner before him he discovered that he did not want anything to eat He forced down a few mouthfuls then put on his overcoat kissed his mother good by and went out But where should he go That was the question There were but three grocery stores in town and he knew that they were supplied with all the clerks they needed If the truth must be told he did not expect to obtain another situation But it would never do he told himself to give up without making an effort and besides he felt much better while he was stirring about in the open air than he would have felt if he had remained at home and mourned over his hard luck When he reached Main Street he could not muster up courage enough to enter a single one of the stores at which he had determined to apply for work Who would hire a boy that had been refused a letter of recommendation by his last employer While he was turning this question over in his mind someone called out Hallo there You re just the boy I want to see Come in here Oscar turned and found that he had been hailed by Mr Jackson the village druggist a fat jolly man who seemed to carry an atmosphere of cheerfulness with him wherever he went He gave the boy s hand a tremendous grip and shake after which he led him through the store into the office pushed him into a chair and seated himself in another Well Oscar said he I haven t seen you for a long time How does the world use you The world uses me well enough replied Oscar but some of the people in it might treat me a little better if they were so inclined Yes there are a good many people about us who seem to be of no earthly use here except to get themselves and others into trouble said the druggist and when we meet any of them the best thing we can do is to attend to our own business and pay no attention to them But what shall a fellow do when he has no business of his own to attend to asked Oscar Mr Jackson laughed so loudly and heartily that the boy was obliged to laugh too I know what you mean by that said the former I heard this morning that Mr Smith had discharged you and if I were in your place I should be glad of it I guess he didn t pay you much No sir but the little he did pay me was very acceptable In fact I don t see how I can get on without it I must find another situation to day if it is a possible thing Well you might as well give up the idea for it isn t possible answered the druggist I ll warrant that Smith has had half a dozen applications for your place already Now while you are waiting for something to turn up why can t you do a little job of work for me I want a case of birds to put in my dining room something like the one you sold Parker only different you know that is different birds and different groupings if that s the way to express it Oscar straightened up in his chair at once It was astonishing what a change these few words made in his feelings I believe Parker paid you forty dollars for that case of his didn t he continued the druggist Well I m willing to pay the same price for one equally as good How long will it take you to put it up for me About a week I have all the birds I need they are a fine lot too if I do say it myself but I must make the case you know All right Go to work as soon as you please When it is finished take it to my house Mrs Jackson will show you where to put it and come here for your money Remember now that I want nothing but game birds I don t care for snow birds and canaries like those you put in Parker s case They were not canaries said Oscar who could hardly help smiling at the jolly man s ignorance of natural history They were gold finches the little fellows you sometimes see picking the seeds out of thistles Oh said Mr Jackson Well I don t want any of em I want nothing but game birds I am sorry to say that I can t fill the order that way replied Oscar The bottom of the case won t hold all the birds I intend to give you You needn t put them all on the bottom Stand them up in a tree the way you did Parker s The wood cock snipe and plover are small birds and they could go up there as well as not It was now Oscar s turn to laugh I can put a grouse in the tree said he but who ever heard of a snipe or wood cock in such a situation Those birds are not perchers or climbers they are waders and live wholly on the ground Oh ah said Mr Jackson settling back in his chair with an air which said that Oscar had not made matters much clearer to him by his explanation But I ll tell you what s a fact he added straightening up again as a bright idea struck him I know I have seen quails in trees So have I but it was only when they were pursued by some animal such as a dog or fox If I should put any quails in your tree I d have to account for their presence there by putting a fox on the bottom of the case and he would take up too much room Well Oscar said the druggist after thinking a moment I guess you understand your business better than I do Fix up the case to suit yourself and I shall be satisfied Just then the front door opened and a couple of ladies came in Mr Jackson hurried out to wait upon them while Oscar who was in a great hurry to earn those forty dollars buttoned his overcoat and left the store His face was fairly radiant with joy and so completely was he wrapped up in his own thoughts that he did not see the gentleman who after trying in vain to avoid a collision with him finally seized him by the arm and held him fast Why Oscar I thought it was you exclaimed the gentleman How do you do By the way he added without giving the boy a chance to reply have you any more of those horned owls that you stuffed last winter No sir they are all sold answered Oscar What did you get apiece for them Three dollars Well now I want one of them to put into a little niche at the head of my stairway continued the gentleman If you will shoot one for me and mount it I ll give you three dollars for it I am afraid I can t do it Mr Shaw They are very scarce and those I shot last winter I found by accident Then get up a little earlier in the morning and hunt a little later at night and I ll give you five dollars If you succeed bring the bird around and your money is ready I ll do my best Now I ll just tell you what s the truth said Oscar to himself as he pulled his collar up around his ears and once more turned his face toward home I ve got some friends yet I can make the first payment on that mortgage interest and all and have a little money left to keep us in fuel and provisions until I can earn more Two orders in one day They came in just at the right time too I haven t had a chance to sell a bird before for six months Oscar did not know that the orders he had just received had been obtained for him that morning through the influence of Mr Parker If he had known it he would have lost no time in hunting up his benefactor and thanking him for the interest he took in his welfare But attributing his unexpected stroke of fortune to his good luck which he believed had not yet wholly deserted him he walked homeward with a light heart and the smile he carried into his mother s presence was instantly reflected from her own face Yes I have found work said he in reply to her inquiring look I ve a chance to make as much money in a week as I could have made in the store in two months Mr Jackson wants a case of birds something like the one I sold Mr Parker and Mr Shaw wants a horned owl I am not certain that I shall be able to fill the last order for an owl is a bird you can t find every day but I shall do my best for a five dollar bill is worth trying for Oscar ran upstairs to his room and when he came down again he was dressed for work Taking a bunch of keys from a nail in the kitchen he hurried through the wood shed and paused in front of the door leading into his workshop As he inserted one of the keys into the lock a loud bay of welcome arose from the inside and when he opened the door Bugle the finest fox hound that had ever been seen about Eaton crawled out from his warm bed under the work bench and after lazily stretching himself jumped up and placed his forepaws on his master s shoulders Bugle was a well trained hunting dog and so fond was he of following his favorite game that his master was obliged to lock him up in the shop every morning The hound would stay about the house in perfect contentment so long as Oscar was there but when the latter went to school or to the store Bugle would soon grow lonely and then he would hunt the town over to find someone with a gun on his shoulder If he succeeded in his object he would stick close to that man s side and if the man went to the woods Bugle would go also and run foxes for him with as much zeal and perseverance as he exhibited in working for his master If he could not find anyone who was going hunting he would start out alone and sometimes he would be gone two or three days He could not hunt foxes to any advantage by himself for there was need for someone to stand on the runways and shoot the game as it passed but sometimes he succeeded in digging a hare out of a rotten log in which it had taken refuge and he always brought the game home to show that his day s work had not been thrown away Oscar did not like this roving disposition on the part of his favorite and as two or three attempts had been made to steal the hound he thought it best to keep him under lock and key Oscar s work shop was a clean well lighted apartment and in it the boy had spent many a stormy Saturday while he was a student at the high school but since he had been employed in the store he had done but little work there for his time was fully occupied from seven in the morning until nine and sometimes ten o clock at night He was glad to find himself there once more for he felt as if he were among friends from whom he had long been separated The side of the room opposite the door was occupied by a carpenter s bench on which were several specimens of Oscar s handiwork such as jointed bass rods models of yachts both sloop and schooner rigged and also a neat little centre table which needed only the staining and polishing to make it ready to take its place in his mother s sitting room At the lower end of the bench was a curtain reaching from the ceiling to the floor Oscar drew aside this curtain revealing a little recess about ten feet square two sides of which were fitted up with shelves At the end opposite the curtain was a wide window and under it was a table filled with little boxes containing glass eyes and an assortment of tools such as taxidermists use The shelves were filled with stuffed birds and animals The most prominent object in the collection was a magnificent gray eagle which leaned forward on his perch with his wings half raised his neck stretched out and his eyes fastened upon a plump mallard standing on one foot in the corner below him with his bill buried under his wing and his eyes closed as if he were fast asleep and so life like did the eagle look that one almost expected to see him leap from his perch and bear the duck off in his talons There were hawks blue jays crows snow buntings grouse quails snipes cedar birds and gold finches upon the shelves in fact almost all the varieties of the feathered creation which were to be found in the woods about Eaton were here represented And they were all arranged with artistic taste too Oscar had carefully studied the habits of every bird and animal he hunted and in his collection there was not one that was awkwardly mounted or that was placed in a position which the bird or animal would not have assumed during his life time A red fox on the lower shelf was creeping along in a crouching attitude evidently meditating an attack upon a wild goose which stood a little distance away engaged in arranging its plumage a snowy owl watched with wide and solemn eyes a gray squirrel sitting upon its haunches and gnawing its way into a hickory nut which it held between its fore paws a butcher bird was engaged in its usual occupation of impaling an insect upon a thorn a hawk was about to begin a meal upon an unfortunate quail it had just captured a mink had its eyes fastened upon a hare which was sitting comfortably in its form a ruffed grouse the last object Oscar had mounted was standing up as straight as an arrow evidently watching the boy as he came in This is the position the grouse always assumes when it is sitting in a tree and sees a hunter approaching It draws itself up so stiffly and remains so motionless that the sportsman often mistakes it for a part of the limb on which it is sitting and passes on without trying a shot at it The birds were all mounted on temporary perches made by nailing two short pieces of wood together in the form of the letter T the standard being set into a block about three inches square to enable them to retain an upright position They were fastened to the perch by the wires that came down through the legs and feet and as the wires extended into the body and assisted to keep the birds in shape the positions of the specimens could be changed in an instant at the will of the taxidermist Oscar had killed and mounted every one of them himself and took no little pride in showing them to his friends CHAPTER V OSCAR RECEIVES A LETTER The young taxidermist walked over to the table and picked up the grouse It was a perfect specimen of his work and he held it off at arm s length and admired it I ll put this in Mr Jackson s case said he as he arranged some of the plumage with a pair of pliers Then I ll put in a pair of quails two English snipes two wood cock that young heron over there and they will be as many as I can stand on the bottom of the case without crowding them too much Then in the tree I ll put an imperial wood pecker and hold on I ve got another gamebird that I can put in the tree The boy was so well pleased with the thought that had just passed through his mind that he laughed outright He put the grouse back upon the table and took from one of the shelves a beautiful bird which was mounted on a board instead of a perch because it was web footed He looked at it closely and found that it was in as good order as when it first came out from under his hands Yes I ll put that in the tree too said he with another laugh and we ll see what Mr Jackson will say when he finds it there Oscar passed along the shelves taking down one specimen after another and when he had selected as many as he thought he could use he went into the shop dropped the curtain to its place and after lighting a fire in the stove took some well seasoned boards from the corner where he had placed them for safe keeping and went to work upon the case During the next few days Oscar toiled early and late Under his skilful hands the case grew in size and shape and when at last it was put together Oscar thrust his hands into his pockets and stood off to make a critical examination of it The front was composed of double glass doors hung on silver plated hinges the joints were tight and taken altogether it was a piece of work with which any cabinet maker would have been entirely satisfied But it was not yet completed The inside was to be ornamented with a painting of a woodland scene and the outside was to be stained in imitation of black walnut Having satisfied himself that his work could not be improved in any way Oscar put on his coat took a small hand saw from the bench and turning the key upon the sleeping Bugle who lay behind the stove dreaming of foxhunts past and to come he bent his steps toward the nearest piece of woods When he came back again an hour later he carried over his shoulder a bundle of small branches which he had cut from hickory saplings Of these he intended to make the tree that was to be put up in the case for the accommodation of some of the specimens He dropped into the post office as he passed by on his way home not because he expected to find anything there but for the reason that it had become a confirmed habit But there was a letter in his mother s box and when the clerk handed it to him he found that it was addressed to himself He opened it as he walked along and the first thing he took out of the envelope was a business card bearing these words CALKINS SON No Court St Yarmouth Poultry Fish Game and Furs sold on Commission Liberal advancements made on consignments A share of the public patronage solicited Humph said Oscar as he thrust the card carelessly into his pocket I don t see what they sent that to me for I can shoot all the game I want and more too And as for fish if I can t supply any three families in town during the season I ll give it up Oscar next took the letter out of the envelope and began reading it in the same careless indifferent way in which he had read the card but before he had gone far he stopped went back to the beginning and read it over again with more interest The letter ran as follows DEAR SIR We intend during the coming winter to make a specialty of small game of all kinds and we wish to engage a competent person in your neighborhood where as we understand partridges quails and rabbits are abundant to shoot for our Yarmouth market We will take all you can send us and you need have no fear of overstocking us The accompanying price current will show you how the market rules at the present date and by examining it carefully you will be able to make an estimate of your probable earnings which ought to be something handsome You have been recommended to us by a gentleman living in your vicinity and we hope you will find it to your interest to return a favorable reply at an early day and begin work for us at once We should like a shipment from you immediately The partridges we are now selling come principally from Michigan and the demand far exceeds the supply Yours etc CALKINS SON Well I declare thought Oscar after he had read the letter over twice in order to fully master the business terms it contained here s another windfall They don t want me to buy of them as I thought they did but they want a chance to buy of me They shall have it I wonder what gentleman it was who was good enough to recommend me to them While Oscar was turning this question over in his mind he glanced at the price current which had been inclosed in the letter and after noting the prices paid for the various kinds of game that were in demand in the Yarmouth market he replaced it in the envelope and began a little problem in mental arithmetic with a view of ascertaining about how much his earnings would amount to each day if he consented to shoot for Calkins Son He based his calculation upon the amount of game he had bagged during some of his previous hunts and in this way he obtained a tolerably fair idea of what his profits would be While he was thus engaged he ran into the outstretched arms of his particular friend Sam Hynes who had been home to dinner and was hurrying back to school Hallo here exclaimed Sam You re just the fellow I want to see What s that on your back Something of which to make a tree to put in a new case of birds I am setting up answered Oscar after he had returned his crony s cordial greeting Say Oscar continued Sam glancing up at the town clock to see how many minutes he could spend in conversation and still reach the school house before the last bell rang what are you going to do next Saturday I shall be quite at your service on that day replied Oscar who knew very well what the question meant Are they coming in yet By hundreds exclaimed Sam with great enthusiasm I have been making inquiries of some farmers who live down the river and they all tell the same story Hang that string out of your window and I ll have you up at half past three We must be on the water at the first peep of day you know Good by This was all that passed between the two friends but they understood each other perfectly Almost every boy has his own way of enjoying himself and Sam Hynes found all his recreation in wild fowl shooting He went fishing sometimes because he liked to be on the river but he could see no fun in jerking a string up and down in the water all day and he preferred to lie back in the boat and watch the clouds as they floated over his head He could see no sport either in tramping about the woods carrying a heavy gun on his shoulders but when it came to shooting over decoys Sam was wide awake and perfectly at home He was the best fellow in the world to go hunting with too If a sudden shower drenched him to the skin and wet his powder so that his gun could not be discharged if the birds flew wild and he returned at night with no more game than he had when he started out in the morning it was all the same to Sam No one ever heard a word of complaint from him He knew how to roast a duck over the flames on a forked stick and could get up so tempting a dinner from the contents of his lunch basket that he was in great demand among the young Nimrods of the village and could have accepted invitations for every Saturday in the year if he had been so disposed But he preferred to hunt with Oscar The latter owned some very fine decoys which he had made and painted himself and he knew how to use them too More than that he was a very lucky young sportsman and those who went with him seldom returned empty handed After taking leave of his friend Oscar continued his walk toward home and before he got there he had finished his problem in mental arithmetic and arrived at the conclusion that he was in a fair way to extricate himself from his financial difficulties and that if the good luck that had followed him ever since he was discharged from the store would only continue for one short year he would be all out of debt and have something in the bank to draw on in case of emergency When Oscar reached home he showed his mother the letter he had received and after spending a few minutes in conversation with her on the subject of market shooting and his chances for making money out of it he went into his work shop and resumed his work On Friday afternoon the case was completed and it was only necessary to wait until the paint on the inside should become dry so that he could put up the tree he had made and place the birds upon it It will be dry to morrow night thought Oscar as he stood with his brush in his hand surveying the woodland scene which ornamented the interior of the case and on Monday morning I will take it over and see what Mr Jackson has to say about it Well boys I am glad to see you Just then the door was thrown open and Sam Hynes came rushing in he was always in a hurry followed by Miles Jackson the nephew of the gentleman for whom the case of birds was intended Sam had dropped in to make sure that the arrangements for the duck hunt on the morrow were fully understood and Miles had come with him to see how Oscar was progressing They did not immediately reply to Oscar s words of greeting for they were too much interested in what they saw before them They looked at the case on all sides admired the picture Oscar had just finished and then they turned their attention to the tree which they examined closely You have got a good fit on these joints said Sam who was himself very handy with tools If you stand a little way from it you would take it for a natural tree It is almost as good a job as I could have done myself What made you drill all these little holes in the branches The wires which support the birds go through those holes and turn up on the other side so that they can t be seen answered Oscar Oh yes I understand Now when do you think What in the world sent that miserable fellow prowling around here I wonder said Sam in an undertone looking at his friend Miles and scowling fiercely This exclamation was called forth by the opening of the door and the entrance of a boy for whom Sam had of late conceived a violent dislike His name was Stuart and he was one of the clerks in Smith Anderson s store The reason Sam disliked him was because he had heard from several sources that Stuart had treated Oscar very rudely ever since Tom ran away with his employers money He would not speak to Oscar at all or even look toward him if he could help it but he had a great deal to say in his presence concerning thieves and defaulting book keepers and cashiers Stuart had better not talk that way in my hearing declared Sam one day when a lot of school boys were talking about Oscar and his troubles and as he said it he doubled up a pair of fists that were pretty large and heavy for a boy of sixteen Oscar is my friend and any fellow who says a word against him can just scratch my name off his good books Mark my words If there was a dishonest clerk in that store he s there yet and if money was missed from the drawer while Oscar was employed there it will be missed now that he is gone Oscar Preston never had a dishonest penny in his hands If Sam had owned the shop he would have ordered Stuart out of it on the instant but as he had no right to do that he simply returned the clerk s bow scowled savagely at his friend Miles and felt like giving Oscar a punch in the ribs because he greeted Stuart so cordially The new comer seemed surprised to find so many boys in the shop and for a minute or two he did not speak He stood with his hand on the latch evidently undecided whether to go out or come in Finally he made up his mind that he would come in I was out delivering goods said he as he closed the door behind him and I thought I would run in for just a moment and see what a taxidermist s shop looks like I have a curiosity to see a bird before it is put up ready for sale All right said Oscar laying down his paint brush I think I can show you some fine specimens Come in here As he spoke he drew aside the curtain and conducted his visitor into the recess while Sam showed what he thought of such a proceeding by picking up a block of wood and hitting the work bench a savage blow with it CHAPTER VI THE AMATEUR DETECTIVE Oscar is too good for any use said Sam turning to Miles and speaking in a low whisper If Stuart had talked about me as I know he has talked about him I d never make up with him in that fashion never Let s go home Oh no whispered Miles in reply I haven t seen any birds yet and neither have you said a word to Oscar about that duck hunt Sam pulled out his knife and hunted around on the bench until he found a pine stick which he proceeded to cut up into the smallest possible pieces while Miles after listening to some explanations that Oscar was making for the benefit of the clerk went into the recess Sam was standing with his back to the three boys but he could distinctly see every move they made On the wall opposite the curtain hung a broken mirror which had once held an honored place in Mrs Preston s parlor Sam glanced into this mirror now and then while he was engaged in cutting up his stick and saw that Stuart was paying very little attention to what Oscar was saying to him He appeared to be very uneasy for he was constantly stepping about and most of the time he kept his eyes fastened intently on Sam When Miles came in and began questioning Oscar about the specimen he was holding in his hands Stuart walked to the other side of the recess ran his eye over the stuffed occupants of the shelves and then he came out into the shop and examined the tree on which Mr Jackson s birds were to be mounted After that he looked at Sam again The latter was standing a little to one side of the mirror with his hat drawn down over his forehead and seemed to see nothing but the stick he was whittling In the work bench directly under the tree was an open drawer in which Oscar kept his paints brushes and various odds and ends Stuart moved up close beside this drawer looked first at Sam then at Miles and Oscar who were still talking earnestly in the recess and as quick as thought pulled something out of his coat pocket raised a sheet of sand paper that lay on the bottom of the drawer and placed the object whatever it was under it This done he backed up against the drawer and pushed it to its place He leaned on the bench for a few seconds looking toward Oscar as if he were listening to what he was saying and then suddenly straightened up I must be going said he starting toward the door I hope I haven t put you to any trouble Oscar None whatever replied the latter And Sam noticed with no little satisfaction that he did not ask the clerk to call again When Stuart closed the door behind him Sam shut up his knife and slammed his stick down in the corner The noise attracted the attention of Miles who looked over his shoulder and was surprised to see Sam holding one forefinger upon his lips and beckoning eagerly to him with the other Miles came out into the shop with an inquiring look on his face while Oscar lingered in the recess to arrange the plumage of one of the specimens which had become rumpled while he was handling it Sam walked over to the drawer of the work bench and opened it standing with his back toward Oscar I know now what that rascal came here for said he in a scarcely audible whisper and I want you for a witness What s that asked Miles in his ordinary tone of voice as his companion raised a sheet of sand paper and brought to light the article Stuart had placed there a few minutes before Say not a word cautioned Sam but come with me and I ll tell you all about it Don t you fellows know that it is very rude to whisper in the presence of a third party said Oscar gravely I am surprised at you You did it while Stuart was in here and I should like to know what you mean by it We didn t want either of you to know what we were talking about answered Sam I wouldn t have treated him as well as you did and I don t think you would have been quite so cordial if you knew as much as we know he added with a significant glance at Miles Oh that s the trouble is it Never mind We were not put here in this world to quarrel with everybody who doesn t like us If we did that we d have time for little else You are not going said Oscar as Sam started for the door with Miles close at his heels Yes we are We have some business that must be attended to at once I ll see you again before I go home Sam banged the door as he ceased speaking and walked through the yard so rapidly that Miles could hardly keep pace with him When he had closed the gate behind him he turned down the sidewalk and hurried on faster than ever Hold up here protested Miles You said you would tell me all about it and how are we going to talk if you go ahead with railroad speed What was it you took out of that drawer and what business had you to touch it I thought it was a pocket book Sam stopped abruptly and drew the article in question from the inside pocket of his coat It was a pocket book and quite a large one too It was made to carry bills at full length It was filled with papers but Sam did not know whether or not there was any money in it for he had not opened it and he did not intend to do so He placed his finger under the silver clasp with which it was fastened and held it up so that his friend could see it What name is that he asked Erastus Smith replied Miles Exactly You saw me take this pocket book out of that drawer didn t you Of course I did Well I know who put it there for I saw him do it Sam brought the pocket book down into his open palm with a sounding whack and looked at his companion as if he thought he had made everything perfectly clear to him but Miles only seemed bewildered I should think you might see through the matter after I have explained it to you said Sam with some impatience But you haven t explained it answered Miles That s so admitted Sam after reflecting a moment I ll do it now while we walk along slowly Stuart put this pocket book in the drawer for as I told you I saw him do it He came into the shop for that very purpose He is the fellow who has been stealing Mr Smith s money but he is trying his level best to fasten the guilt upon Oscar Oh I begin to understand the matter said Miles his face flushing with indignation Now the credit for the discovery I have made does not belong to me continued Sam who was as truthful and honest as he was blunt and fearless I never should have thought of it if it hadn t been for something Mr Parker said to me He told me the other day that if there had been any stealing going on in that store since Tom Preston left Stuart was the guilty one and the reason Mr Parker suspected him was because he has had so much to say against Oscar He has told everybody in town who would listen to him that Oscar was discharged for till tapping and there were a good many who would listen to him for there are people everywhere you know who take unbounded delight in hearing others slandered I had two reasons for watching every move Stuart made while he was in the shop I thought it would be a good plan to keep an eye on him and I was impatient to see him start for the door I didn t want him there It was a wonder he didn t see that you were watching him observed Miles Do you remember that broken looking glass that hangs on the north wall of the shop asked Sam I looked in there and saw everything he did Miles was astonished at his companion s shrewdness and could only look the admiration he felt for him But what made you rush out of the shop in such a hurry he inquired at length Why didn t you tell Oscar all about it and relieve his mind at once Oh it will not hurt him to wait a day or two longer rejoined Sam and his vindication will be all the more welcome when it comes as I am determined it shall come through the man who has injured him Mr Smith has done Oscar a great deal of harm and he must lose no time in undoing it Now then here we are Sam stepped upon the threshold of Smith Anderson s store seized the latch with a determined grip as if he were trying to break it in two threw open the door and walked in The first person he met was Stuart who started back in surprise at the sight of him He was greatly alarmed Sam could see that plainly and he tried to conceal it by stepping briskly behind the counter and drawing the order book toward him What can I do for you boys he asked as he held his pencil poised over the book Nothing growled Sam who could not possibly have spoken civilly to one whom he had caught in the act of trying to ruin his friend He kept on his way toward the office and Stuart as if divining his intention said hurriedly and in a low tone of voice There s no one in there Sam Mr Anderson has gone to the depot to see about some freight and Mr Smith has just stepped out In fact he has gone home and won t be back to night Any word to leave for either of them Sam shook his head and walked right on That s a little too transparent said he to Miles who kept close at his side What did he want to whisper for and why did he turn so red in the face I ll warrant Mr Anderson isn t near the depot and that we shall find Mr Smith perched on his high stool He s always there since Tom went away At that moment as if to confirm his words the back door opened and Mr Anderson came in He was bareheaded and had no overcoat on Moreover he carried a number of packages in his arms and that was all the proof the boys needed to convince them that he had been busy in the warehouse When they entered the office they found the senior partner right where Sam said they would find him on his high stool He laid down his pen and looked at the boys over his spectacles just as he had looked at Oscar on the day he discharged him Mr Smith said Sam may we have a few minutes private conversation with you I suppose so was the reply Is it very private Well we would rather you alone should hear what we have to say If you choose to repeat it that is your own affair As Sam spoke he closed the door behind him and turned the key in the lock Bless my soul exclaimed the grocer what s the matter Mr Smith said Sam without replying to the question have you lost any money lately Not a cent since Oscar went away was the prompt reply Now let me tell you what s a fact exclaimed Sam We didn t come here to listen to any hard words against Oscar Preston and if you are going to use them we ll not stay We ll tell you that much to begin with We will tell you further that you have made no friends by the slanderous reports you have circulated regarding that boy I have circulated no slanderous reports about him replied the grocer who could scarcely believe his ears I said that I didn t think he was honest and I say so yet Yes the story is all over town that you discharged Oscar because you thought he had taken money out of your drawer but all the best people here know that he never did it You say you have lost nothing lately Do you happen to own a pocket book about so long and so wide said Sam placing his hands upon the desk and indicating by them the length and breadth of the article he was describing Mr Smith started as if he had been shot and got off his high stool with such haste that he would have gone headlong to the floor if Miles had not caught him and placed him fairly on his feet again He opened the door of a large safe that stood in one corner of the office and unlocking a little drawer on the inside pulled it out and looked into it Great Moses he ejaculated it is gone I thought so said Sam Was there anything of value in it Was there shouted Mr Smith trembling all over with excitement There was a hundred and fifty dollars in money in it and negotiable paper to the amount of eight hundred dollars more Have you seen it Sam Have you got it Hand it out here Now don t try to rush matters said Sam whose cool deliberate way of talking and acting so exasperated the excited grocer that he could hardly refrain from laying violent hands upon him and searching his pockets This thing must be done decently and in order or it can t be done at all I certainly have a pocket book in my possession but I want to be sure that it belongs to you before I hand it over to you Here Miles look at it while Mr Smith describes it That s it that s it cried the grocer catching a momentary glimpse of the pocket book as Sam handed it to his companion I would know it among a thousand It s mine Give it to me He made an effort to snatch it but Sam was too quick for him He succeeded in placing it in Miles s hands and the latter held fast to it Sam cried the angry and astonished grocer picking up a heavy ruler and banging it down upon his desk do you think I would tell you a falsehood Do you take me for a thief All I have to say about that is if we want people to put implicit faith in us we must be careful how we accuse others of wrong answered Sam boldly Now what sort of a pocket book is it Miles had moved up close to the window and stood with his back toward the grocer holding the pocket book in his hand and waiting for him to describe it He thought he was well acquainted with Sam Hynes but he told himself now that he had never before known what sort of a fellow he was He was astonished at Sam s impudence Mr Smith was one of the oldest business men in Eaton and although he was so close in his dealings and thought so much of a dollar that he had never gained the respect or good will of the majority of the people he had never been suspected of dishonesty or untruthfulness And Sam did not by any means suspect him now He simply wished to show Mr Smith that he had been handling a two edged sword that was liable to cut both ways CHAPTER VII OFF FOR THE RIVER What sort of a pocket book is it repeated Sam Look for my name on the clasp said Mr Smith who was so nervous and impatient that he could not stand still I see it said Miles Then it is my property and you might as well hand it out here at once said the grocer I want to know how much I have lost without any more trifling There s no trifling about this replied Sam There is more than one Erastus Smith in the world who is able to own a pocket book like that Go on Open it and look for a hundred dollars in paper money and fifty dollars in gold said Mr Smith with an air of resignation I find no such sum here answered Miles after he had looked through the pocket book All I see is a single five dollar note Mr Smith groaned Almost thirty two hundred dollars in clean cash gone out of the firm in less than eight months said he with a long drawn sigh That cuts down the profits fearfully fearfully I find here some bills receivable Good exclaimed the grocer I am glad the thief left them There ought to be between eight and nine hundred dollars worth of them Mr Smith then went on to give a description of the bills which were endorsed and filed in nearly the same order in which he referred to them So retentive was his memory that he could recall the dates of a good many of them give their exact wording and tell the color of the paper and ink that were used in writing them After he had gone through half a dozen of the bills in this way Miles turned and looked at Sam Are you satisfied asked the latter I am replied Miles Then hand it over Mr Smith snatched the pocket book as it was extended toward him and climbed to his place upon the high stool Where did you get this said he In a drawer in Oscar Preston s work bench replied Sam Ah said the grocer in a very significant tone of voice Now the next question is How did it come there The answer almost took Mr Smith s breath away Your favorite clerk Will Stuart put it there for I saw him do it said Sam And then he went on to describe in as few words as possible what Stuart had done while he was in Oscar s shop and explained the object he had in view in taking the pocket book out of the drawer without Oscar s knowledge Mr Smith pushed his spectacles over his forehead and listened intently to all the boy had to say and when Sam ceased speaking he brought his hand down upon his desk with a ringing slap I wondered why Stuart was so eager to drive the delivery wagon this afternoon and this explains it said he I see it all now Stuart knew that I do not often have occasion to open that little drawer in the safe and he probably took the book a day or two ago I know it was there last Saturday for I saw it thinking that if he placed it in Oscar s bench where it would certainly have been found if we had taken out a search warrant we would believe that he stole it before he was discharged You have no objection to facing Stuart I suppose None whatever Sam promptly replied that is just what we came here for Mr Smith climbed down from his high stool unlocked and opened the door and looked out into the store The only person he saw there was the junior partner Send Stuart here will you said he Stuart has gone home was the reply He had a sudden attack of sick headache Oh he did did he exclaimed Sam It must have been very sudden for he was well enough ten minutes ago Mr Anderson came into the office in obedience to a sign from his partner and was speedily made acquainted with the object of the boys visit He was almost overwhelmed with astonishment and declared that he never would have believed it of Stuart Now Mr Smith said Sam when there was a little pause in the conversation we will leave this matter in your hands I am ready to be a witness at any time if you decide to prosecute but I shall not spread any damaging reports about Stuart and neither will Miles We don t believe in hitting a person when he s down We have one favor to ask of you and that is that you will make Oscar all the amends in your power for the great injustice you have done him I know what my duty is under the circumstances young gentlemen said Mr Smith shortly He had got his pocket book back and eight hundred dollars worth of bills and he felt a little more independent The boys picked up their caps and left the store while Mr Smith mounted his high stool and mopped his face vigorously with his handkerchief The exciting scene through which he had just passed had brought the perspiration out on his forehead in big drops I had no idea that Sam Hynes was such a bad boy said he to his partner He wouldn t give up that pocket book until I proved its contents and I have done business right here in this town for almost half a century He had the impudence to tell me in effect that if I didn t want to be suspected of dishonesty myself I must not be in such haste to suspect others I declare he s a wonderful bad boy wonderful Meanwhile Sam was walking down the street with his hands in his pockets whistling merrily and taking such strides that Miles after trying in vain to keep up seized him by the arm and held him back Sam said he how dare you talk that way to a grown man If I had been Mr Smith I would have boxed your ears for you Sam looked up at the clouds and laughed heartily You might have got your hands full said he What will your father say when he hears of it continued Miles He ll hear of it as soon as he comes home to night replied Sam I make it a point never to do a thing that I am afraid or ashamed to have him know and I shall tell him of it myself He ll give me a good going over for not being more respectful to gray hairs but I deserve it and I ll never do the like again never added Sam who wished now when it was too late that he had remembered that Mr Smith was the grandfather of two of the members of the ball club to which he belonged I knew well enough that he wouldn t lay claim to any but his own property but he thought I was suspicious of him and it cut him didn t it Perhaps he ll know now how Oscar felt to be unjustly accused Going to turn off here Well good by I promised to see Oscar again you know I ll drop around to morrow night and leave a brace of ducks for your Sunday dinner Now Miles Sam finished the sentence by shaking his finger at his friend and then placing it upon his closed lips I understand and I ll bear it in mind too was the reply Good by and good luck to you When Sam entered the shop where Oscar was still at work the latter had a good many questions to ask regarding his abrupt departure a few minutes before but Sam being all ready for him gave his inquiries prompt replies which although they satisfied Oscar s curiosity did not let him into the secret of the matter The young taxidermist thought his friend appeared to be very jubilant and well he might for he had done something to be proud of Suppose a constable had come up there with a search warrant and found Mr Smith s property in the place where Stuart had left it Oscar would have been in trouble indeed The latter did not know what a narrow escape he had had that day and it was no part of his companion s plan to enlighten him Sam never talked about his exploits He sat on the bench with his hands under his legs school boy fashion pounded with the heels of his boots against the drawer in which the pocket book had been concealed and talked incessantly about the duck hunt that was to come off the next day When all their plans had been discussed Sam said good night and left the shop As soon as Oscar had eaten his supper he went up to his room and when he came down again he carried a game bag powder flask and shot pouch in one hand and a double barrel gun in the other Oscar s gun was not just the weapon that one would expect to see after listening to the description of it which Leon Parker had given his cousin It was a good deal larger and heavier than the little bird gun which held so prominent a place in Leon s estimation but it was not a blunderbuss and there were several boys and men too in the village who would have been glad to purchase it at any figures the owner might have put upon it But it had once belonged to his father and Oscar would not have parted with it for any consideration It was known all over the country as a brag shooting gun and among all the young hunters in the neighborhood there were but few who could show as many birds at the end of a day s hunt as Oscar could Its weight was no detriment to him for his strong muscles enabled him to handle it very easily and quickly and he seldom missed a double shot when the opportunity to make it was presented to him Having received a thorough rubbing inside and out the weapon was set away in one corner with a couple of corks in the muzzles and an oiled rag over the tubes to keep out the dust and two hours later Oscar was snug in bed wrapped in a dreamless slumber One of his windows was raised about three inches and through this opening ran a stout cord one end of which was tied to a chair standing at the head of Oscar s bed the other reached down to the ground and was securely fastened to a rose bush Shortly after four o clock in the morning Bugle who always slept on the front porch when the weather was warm enough to permit it challenged someone who came into the yard and soon thereafter the cord began to saw up and down over the window sill The chair moved but Oscar slept on all unconscious of it The person below waited and listened a few seconds and then renewed his pulls at the string putting considerably more strength and energy into them This time the chair was upset with a loud crash and Oscar jumped up and hurried to the window It was too dark to see anybody but he knew who was there We ll have to make haste for I overslept myself said Sam Hynes s well known voice Did I do any damage up there I heard something come down pretty hard Oh no was the reassuring answer Have you had any breakfast Of course not I intend to get it here All right I ll be down in five minutes Oscar dressed himself with all haste and when he went downstairs he found Sam waiting for him at the back door Bugle entered when Sam did he always kept as close to a gun as he could and frisked about in high glee thrashing the boys with his heavy tail and continually getting in their way Splendid morning said Sam as he leaned his gun up in one corner Warm and foggy more like spring than fall The ducks always fly low during a fog What can I do to help you Nothing at all Just sit down and make yourself comfortable The fire is laid and it will take but a few minutes to make a cup of coffee You think it is going to be a good day do you Then I ought to make some money before night Calkins Son of Yarmouth have written me a letter offering to take all the game I can send them You don t say so exclaimed Sam I am glad to hear it He did not tell Oscar that he knew all about it but such was the fact He knew that Mr Parker had been down to the city to attend to some legal business for that very firm and it was when he was looking about their store and listening while Mr Calkins expressed his regrets that he could not secure game enough to supply the demand which was unusually great just then that the lawyer happened to think of Oscar whom he recommended as the best person Mr Calkins could engage to shoot for him The latter seeing that his visitor was interested in the boy said he would try to secure his services and if he succeeded he would pay him for his game as soon as it was received and not wait to sell it on commission Mr Parker gave the merchant Oscar s address and that was the way our hero came to be a market shooter Sam we repeat knew all about it but he listened while Oscar talked of the offer he had received and acted as though everything he heard was news to him The fire was soon cracking away merrily and while waiting for the kettle to boil Oscar busied himself in setting the table Bugle finding that he was entirely neglected called attention to himself by uttering a deafening bay Silence exclaimed Oscar That will never do He will disturb mother We must shut him up Bugle is no good for ducks I ll fix him said Sam Take your gun with you suggested Oscar as Sam took the key of the shop down from its nail You ll never get him in there if you don t Bugle was quite ready to accompany Sam when he saw the boy pick up his double barrel that is he was ready to accompany him to the woods but he would not follow him to the shop He ran out of the wood shed and thrusting his head in at the door looked at Sam but he could not be induced to go near him Oscar could hear his friend coaxing and scolding and finally a suppressed whine from Bugle told him that Sam had been obliged to collar the animal and drag him into his prison A hearty breakfast having been disposed of a lunch was stowed away in Oscar s game bag and the boys were ready for the start In the wood shed they found a light wheelbarrow which contained the decoys they were to use during the hunt and also the sail and oars belonging to Oscar s boat Sam took his friend s gun under his arm Oscar set the wheelbarrow in motion and with Bugle s farewell ringing in their ears they set out for the river at a rapid walk Illustration BUGLE RECOGNIZES HIS ENEMIES CHAPTER VIII A FORTUNATE DUCK HUNT The young hunters found Oscar s skiff where the owner had left it drawn high and dry upon the bank and fastened with a lock and chain to a tree that stood a short distance below Mr Peck s boat house Mr Peck who made a business of fishing and renting sail and row boats for the accommodation of the village pleasure seekers was standing on his wharf when the boys came up Going ducking said he Well I ll tell you what I wish you would do for me he added upon receiving an affirmative reply I let one of my boats yesterday afternoon to a stranger to go down to Cottonwood He was to have been back before dark but I aint seen no signs of him yet Didn t look to me like a man who would be likely to run off with a boat because he wore a gold watch and gold spectacles and that showed that he was able to buy a boat if he d wanted one How long has this fog been on asked Oscar Ever since midnight Then perhaps he became bewildered and tied up somewhere to wait for the fog to lift continued Oscar If he is a stranger of course he doesn t know the river I don t see how in the world he could get bewildered observed Sam If he had rowed over to this bank and come straight up stream he would have found the village without any trouble He certainly knew enough for that Well I aint so certain of it neither Sam said Mr Peck Pears to me now that I think of it that he didn t know much of anything I give him my best boat too for he looked as though he was able to pay for it I wish you d kinder keep an eye out for him and set him right if he has missed his reckoning We ll do it Mr Peck said Sam Oscar unlocked his boat turned it right side up with his companion s assistance and pushed it into the water Here again Leon s description was at fault Oscar s craft was not a leaky old scow it was a light easy running skiff As he had built it himself of course it was not as finely modelled as some of Mr Peck s costly boats but it answered the purpose for which it was intended Leon had seen it come up to Mr Peck s wharf almost filled with wild ducks It had more than once beaten his nice little boat in a fair race up the river from Squaw Island It was named after Sam s sister Katie the prettiest girl in the village who seemed to prefer Oscar s company to Leon s and perhaps these were the reasons why the latter could not speak well of it The skiff having been launched the sail was put into it The game bags were stowed away in a little locker in the bow the guns were carefully loaded and put in their proper places one in the stern and the other on the midship thwart and then Sam shipped the rudder while Oscar got out the oars and rowed away into the fog In five minutes Mr Peck s wharf and boat house were out of sight and the boys found themselves enveloped in a cloud which concealed everything that was more than twenty yards distant from their boat How will this do Sam said Oscar resting on his oars Do you hear that asked his companion in reply I think we had better go a little further out Oscar thought so too He dipped the oars into the water again and the boat moved deeper into the fog The sound that had attracted Sam s attention was made by a solitary whistle wing as he pursued his way down the river Oscar pulled steadily for five minutes longer and then the oars were allowed to swing around by the side of the boat and each boy picking up his gun squared about on his seat and waited for a quarter of a minute only They had scarcely taken their positions before a flock of mallards suddenly emerged from the fog flying so close to the water that the young hunters could have knocked them down with their guns if they had continued on their way but of course they did not The ducks arose in the air and sheered off the instant they discovered the boat and the boys sprang to their feet at the same time As the flock flew over their heads they turned away from each other and when the birds had passed the boat discharged their double barrels in quick succession They pulled the triggers so nearly at the same instant that the four reports sounded like two Learn two things here in regard to shooting on the wing if you do not know them already Never fire at a wild fowl as he is coming toward you The thick feathers on his breast will glance the shot and if some of them do not chance to hit him in the head he will continue on his way unharmed Wait until he has passed you then aim low and a little in advance of him keeping both eyes open and holding so that you can see daylight between him and the muzzle of your gun then the shot will pass under his feathers and in a few seconds more you can put him in your game bag If you are hunting with a companion don t turn toward him when you are getting ready to shoot but turn away from him Then if you accidentally discharge your gun in your excitement but remember that you must not allow yourself to become excited the shot will go up into the empty air and no one will be injured That will do for a beginning said Sam when the smoke had cleared away so that the boys could see the effect of their shot How many ducks were there in that flock About thirty said Oscar and they were all mallards too Well we ve got two four hold on there Sam fell to reloading his gun with all possible haste while Oscar quickly resumed his seat picked up the oars and turned the boat s head down the stream Three of the ducks had come down with broken wings and were now swimming rapidly away into the fog It did not take Sam much longer to charge his old fashioned muzzle loader than it would take you to charge your new fashioned breech loader He never used loose shot during a hunt On rainy days when he had nothing else to do he put up a lot of cartridges He first made a number of paper bags a little smaller than the bore of his gun and glued a wad fast to one end of them When they became dry he filled them with different kinds of shot putting bird shot in one and duck shot in another closed the bag and fastened another wad at that end Then all he had to do when he wanted to load his gun was to pour in the powder from his flask drive home a couple of these cartridges which he carried loose in his coat pocket put on the caps which he carried loose in his vest pocket and the weapon was ready to be discharged All this he did in the same space of time that Oscar occupied in turning the boat around He made sure work of two of the wounded ducks and the other which seemed too badly hurt to dive was knocked on the head with an oar They secured seven ducks that time and twelve more out of three other flocks which passed over their heads within the next twenty minutes Now let me row awhile said Sam when the last bird had been picked up You are doing all the work and I am having all the fun Yes you have had all the best of it answered Oscar as he exchanged places with his companion It is going to blow now and this fog will all be gone in ten minutes I think we had better go down to the head of the island and put out our decoys It turned out just as Oscar said it would The breeze which had sprung up since they left the shore grew stronger every minute the fog rapidly faded away and in a quarter of an hour the young hunters had a clear river before them The village was out of sight behind the point and Squaw Island their favorite camping and shooting ground was in plain view and about two miles away Oscar directed the boat toward it and Sam after taking off his coat laid out his strength on the oars The wind came up the river in strong but fitful gusts and finally raised a sea that made the little boat dance about right merrily I don t think we are going to have such a splendid day after all observed Sam who had grown very weatherwise during his numerous excursions down the river I wish this wind would hold up and let the fog settle down again I don t like it Neither does that fellow answered Oscar looking over his companion s shoulder toward some object further down the river The wind must be cutting up some strange shines down there or else he doesn t know what he is about Just look at him Sam released his hold upon the oars allowing them to swing back alongside the skiff and facing about on his seat directed his gaze down the river Off the head of Squaw Island he discovered a sail boat which was acting in a very singular manner The wind was blowing straight up the river and it would have been no trouble at all for one who understood his business to make rapid headway against the current But it soon became plain to Oscar and Sam both of whom were as good sailors as boys ever get to be who have had no opportunity to try their skill on deep water that the man who was seated at the helm of the sail boat did not understand his business Instead of letting out the sheet as he ought to have done he had drawn it taut at the same time holding the bow of his boat up the river The consequence was that the sail was shaking violently and he was making no headway at all That s the boat Mr Peck is looking for said Sam and if that is the way she has been handled ever since she left the village I don t wonder that she didn t get back last night Perhaps we had better go down there replied Oscar That man doesn t seem to be quite up to my gracious There he goes Give me an oar quick Before the words had fairly left Oscar s lips one of the oars was unshipped and placed in his hands The sail boat had been upset through the ignorance or carelessness of her skipper The latter becoming dissatisfied with the very slow progress he was making had brought his craft around upon the other tack but he did not change his own position He pushed the boom over his head as it swung around and instead of moving over to the windward side he kept his seat on the leeward gunwale and his own weight added to the weight of the sail and the pressure of the wind against the canvas overturned the boat before he could think twice If you ever pulled in your life pull now exclaimed Oscar as he shipped his oar and tugged at it until he fairly made things snap You re stroke do your level best cried Sam You ll not drive your end of the boat ahead of mine I ll promise you that Oscar s skiff had never travelled so rapidly under the white ash breeze before The boys being both good oarsmen knew how to make every stroke tell and they brought all their strength and skill into requisition Guided by Sam who sat in the bow and looked over his shoulder occasionally to make sure of her course the Katie flew over the waters like a wild fowl on the wing and in much less time than the boys had expected she came up with and passed the overturned boat which was floating bottom up with the current The young hunters ceased rowing and springing to their feet looked in every direction They could see nobody and the fear that after all their efforts they had arrived too late to save the luckless skipper of the sail boat was already half formed in their minds when a shrill piping voice called to them from the water This way if you please I have met with a most untoward accident and I believe I am in need of a little assistance Well he is a cool one whoever he is said Sam in a low tone If I were in his situation I should think I stood in need of a good deal of assistance Illustration JUST IN TIME Sam quickly shipped the oar which his companion handed to him and pulled toward the disabled boat while Oscar threw off his coat pushed back his sleeves and jumping upon the stern sheets showed Sam by signs how to guide the skiff A few of the latter s long sweeping strokes brought them around the stern of the sail boat and there clinging to the swaying rudder with both hands and apparently so nearly overcome by his sudden immersion in the cold water that he was on the very point of letting go his hold was a bald headed old gentleman in spectacles As the boys came up he extended one hand toward them and at the same instant the other slipped off the rudder He went down like a piece of lead and in a second more would have been out of sight had not Oscar dashed forward plunged his arms into the water up to his shoulders and seized him by the collar This action on his part would have overturned the skiff in an instant or else Oscar would have gone overboard had it not been for an equally prompt action on the part of Sam Hynes The latter who never lost his head under any circumstances threw himself as far as he could over the opposite side of the boat to counterbalance Oscar s weight at the same time bracing his feet firmly and seizing his friend by the waistband of his trousers Hang on to him he shouted and I can trim the boat and heave you both in Sam was noted among his fellows for his strength but on this occasion it seemed that he had undertaken more than he could accomplish The skipper of the sail boat was so completely benumbed with the cold and so nearly strangled that he could not help himself Oscar was pretty large and heavy for a boy of his age and Sam found that it was not so easy to haul them both into the boat But after pulling and tugging until he was red in the face he succeeded in bringing Oscar to an upright position so that the latter could use some of his own strength and then the work was quickly done The old gentleman was pulled over the side and placed on the bottom of the skiff where he would be somewhat protected from the wind Sam s hat was put upon his head and Oscar s coat was snugly wrapped about his shoulders He had had a very narrow escape but to the great amazement of the boys who had saved him he did not seem to be at all disconcerted He wiped the water from his face coughed once or twice and said in a shrill voice addressing himself to Oscar This is neither the time nor the place young gentleman to thank you for the gallant service you have rendered me but I assure you it shall not be forgotten I have to day received a new insight into meteorological phenomena of which I have been a close student for a life time Winds as I now know are How long the rescued man would have continued to talk in this strain it is hard to tell but just then he began to shiver all over and his teeth chattered so violently that he could not utter a word The boys who had listened to this speech with the greatest astonishment exchanging significant glances the while were recalled to themselves by these signs of suffering CHAPTER IX THE CAMP ON THE ISLAND Give me an oar exclaimed Oscar We must get back to the village without the loss of a moment Then hoist the sail said Sam and we ll go up flying It would be of no use The wind is dying away and that fog will be down on us in a quarter of an hour thicker than ever Oscar who pulled the stroke oar kept his friend Sam exceedingly busy during the next forty five minutes and tested that young gentleman s endurance and muscle in a way they had never been tested before They were both tired and quite out of breath when they reached the wharf where they found Mr Peck and Mr Hall the miller waiting for them The boys were glad to see Mr Hall there His grist mill was located but a few rods away and they knew that there was a good fire in the office in front of which their half frozen passenger would soon be thoroughly dried and thawed out The two men had seen the skiff coming up the river and knowing by the way the oars were handled that there was something wrong they had waited to see what it was When they discovered the rescued man sitting on the bottom of the boat they knew what had happened and there was no need of inquiries Give us your hand sir said Mr Hall as the boys lifted the old gentleman to his feet and I ll take you right over to my office I ve got a red hot stove there Just catch hold of his other arm Sam and help him along Where did you find him asked Mr Peck when he was left alone with Oscar And where s my boat We saw him capsize off the head of the island replied the boy Didn t I tell you that he didn t seem to know much of anything exclaimed Mr Peck in disgust There s no excuse for upsetting that boat in this wind None whatever was Oscar s answer When he jibed the sail he didn t move over to windward and it was his weight and the sails that overturned the boat The wind wasn t to blame for it at all We left the boat as we found it keel up and going down the river as fast as the current could take it Our passenger was so nearly exhausted that we couldn t stop to pick it up Mr Peck remarked that he would go down after it himself and charge the bald headed old gentleman a good round sum too for his carelessness and just then Sam came back wearing one of Mr Hall s old caps and carrying Oscar s coat over his arm He had left his own cap he said for the gentleman to wear for of course he couldn t let him walk to his hotel bareheaded While Sam was speaking he jumped down into the boat which was at once pushed out into the stream and headed toward Squaw Island The young hunters had lost more than an hour and a half of the best part of the day but still there was time enough for them to double the size of their bag if the ducks would only be accommodating enough to come within range of their double barrels Contrary to Oscar s predictions the breeze which had so suddenly sprung up and driven off the fog continued to blow steadily for three hours Within twenty minutes after leaving Mr Peck s wharf they reached the island but they did not add a single duck to their bag on the way They saw plenty of birds but every flock flew wild Oscar at once put Sam and his double barrel on shore and then pulled back into the stream a short distance to set out his decoys While he was thus employed Sam was engaged in cutting branches from the willows that grew near by and filling up the gaps the winds had made in the blind they had put up there the year before It was built upon the top of a little knoll about thirty yards from the place where the decoys were anchored and so completely was it concealed by the tall weeds and grass which grew on every side that anyone who did not know just where to look for it would have hard work to find it When their preparations were all completed the skiff was hidden in a little bay surrounded by the thicket of willows before spoken of and the boys with their guns in their hands sat down behind their blind opposite two loopholes which commanded a view as far up as the point and talked over the incidents of the morning while waiting for the first flock of ducks to swing to their decoys They came to three conclusions concerning the man they had saved from going to the bottom of the river He was well to do in the world judging by his appearance he knew something about physical geography and he was not a proper person to be entrusted with the management of a sail boat Thus far they agreed and then they began to differ in their opinions Sam declared that there was something wrong with his upper story No man with a level head on his shoulders would talk as he did immediately after being rescued from a watery grave Oscar however had other ideas and as it happened they were correct He is completely wrapped up in his books said the boy Perhaps he does not know much outside of them but you take him there and he is perfectly at home There s more knowledge in that little bald head of his than you and I can ever hope to acquire Sam shrugged his shoulders with an air which said Perhaps there is and perhaps there isn t and just then the discussion was cut short by the appearance of a flock of mallards which drew to their decoys They circled around them once or twice and were on the point of alighting among them when one wary old fellow in the flock not liking the looks of the wooden deceptions mounted higher into the air with a warning quack Some of the flock followed him and others tried to do so but could not Even the wary old fellow himself did not go far for Oscar brought him down in company with two others before his warning note was fairly uttered The volley was not as effective as the boys intended it should be for only five ducks fell The current carried them to the shore in a few minutes and Oscar brought them in and placed them behind the blind The sport continued for two hours and a half and then the breeze having died away the fog settled down again this time bringing rain with it When the decoys were shut out from view the boys laid aside their guns and Oscar after placing his game bag within easy reach of his friend s hand arose to his feet and walked off toward the willows while Sam began to cut up some dry branches with his knife By the time Oscar returned with an armful of wood he had found in the thicket Sam had raised a good sized pile of shavings and kindling wood and a roaring fire was under way in short order While Oscar continued to make regular trips between the thicket and the fire bringing his arms full of wood each time Sam selected a duck from the pile behind the blind plucked and cleaned it with skill that would have done credit to any professional cook and having impaled it upon a forked stick thrust the stick into the ground beside the fire and left it there while he proceeded to overhaul the contents of his game bag and Oscar s The dinner being well under way and all the firewood they were likely to need having been placed close at hand the young hunters sat down to take a rest for the exertions they had made to rescue the skipper of the sail boat and carry him to the village before he froze to death had wearied them not a little Now and then a hoarse quack quack came to their ears through the thick mist followed by a loud splashing in the water as a flock of ducks settled into if and occasionally they heard a lonely whistle wing flying down the river but the fog concealed everything from their view outside of a radius of twenty yards and they were reluctantly compelled to allow the birds to pass unharmed They had made themselves comfortable in spite of the moist condition of things The branches that Oscar had spread over the ground kept their feet out of the mud the high blind behind which the fire was built served to protect them from the gusts of rain that came out of the fog and the boys were well contented and were prepared to enjoy their dinner as heartily as though they had a tight roof over their heads The dinner was well worth eating as all Sam s dinners were and when ample justice had been done to it Oscar brought up the ducks that were in the boat and placed them with those that were piled behind the blind Sam said he when he had counted them we ve got just forty two A pretty good day s work replied Sam I want six of them You take the rest and ship them to Yarmouth I guess not answered Oscar promptly We ll divide as we have always done Twenty one of these ducks belong to you and if you want any of them shipped to the city you can attend to the matter yourself So I can I didn t think of that Sam spoke as though he did not care what was done with the ducks but there was something in his tone that caused Oscar to sit up on his knees and look at him very sharply He knew well enough that if Sam sent any of the ducks to Yarmouth they would be sent in his Oscar s name and that his friend would expect him to receive the proceeds and apply them to his own use Sam did not need the money himself for he had a rich and indulgent father but that made no difference to Oscar who wanted to earn every cent he spent Sam said he earnestly if you do that I shall be very angry at you If I do what returned Sam innocently Oh you can t fool me If you do it I ll never go hunting with you again Then I ll not do it of course but I don t know what you mean all the same Now as we have nothing else to do let s draw these birds Our shooting is over for the day And so it proved The boys remained behind their blind until it was three o clock by Sam s watch but not another duck showed himself They heard them splashing in the water on both sides of the island but the mist shut them out from view The rain having by this time put out their fire and the birds having been cleaned and made ready for the market the skiff was launched the ducks were packed away in the bows the guns and empty game bags were stowed in the stern and after the decoys had been picked up the boys pulled through the fog toward the village When they came alongside the wharf they found Mr Peck and Mr Hall there as before The former was hard at work upon the wreck of his sail boat which he had found near the foot of the island and towed home after infinite trouble and Mr Hall stood by with his hands in his pockets looking at him Well boys said the miller your crazy man is all right He stayed by my stove until he was warmed and dried and then he started for his hotel There exclaimed Sam turning to Oscar with a triumphant air What did I tell you Didn t I say he was cracked That accounts for his upsetting the boat remarked Mr Peck I knew well enough that no man who had any sense into his head could capsize in such a breeze as he did There is something wrong with him continued Mr Hall While he was standing there shivering in front of my stove he discovered my pet squirrels and canaries and he walked over to their cages and talked to them in the strangest language I ever heard I took it to be Greek or Latin He said he had been down the river after what did he call those things he was looking for Peck Blessed if I know was the answer I never heard of any such things before He s got an idea that he is connected with some college continued Mr Hall and that somebody has given him a lot of money to spend in some foolish way He didn t think until he got ready to start for his hotel that he had lost his gun when his boat upset The only sensible thing he did while he was in my office was to give me ten dollars to pay Mr Peck for his trouble and take down Oscar s name and street I told him that you had a fancy for shooting birds and animals and he said he would make it a point to drop around and see you As the miller ceased speaking he walked off toward his office Mr Peck resumed his work upon the wreck Oscar went into the boat house after his wheelbarrow and Sam began unloading the skiff When everything had been taken out of it the boat was drawn up on the bank turned bottom upward and made fast to a tree with a chain and padlock The sail and the oars belonging to it as well as the decoys were stowed away in one corner of Mr Peck s boat house where they were to remain until Oscar could find time to come after them The ducks made as large a load as he could take to the village in his wheelbarrow When all this work had been done Sam selected six of the finest ducks from the pile and after tying their feet together with a piece of stout twine placed them by the side of the boat house out of the way and began to assist Oscar in packing the others away in the wheelbarrow Hold on there exclaimed the latter How many did you put in then Don t know answered Sam depositing another armful on top of the first Didn t count em But I want you to count them I own just twenty one of these ducks Don t you want the others Of course not We re going to divide Those ducks will all have to come out of that wheelbarrow again so that I can count them All right exclaimed Sam out they come And suiting the action to the word he overturned the wheelbarrow spilling the ducks upon the wharf Now count them yourself said he and then you ll know that you have got what you want Oscar proceeded to count out his share of the birds which he packed away in the wheelbarrow and having placed his gun game bag and powder and shot flasks on top of them he stopped and looked around for Sam He was standing near the shore end of the wharf with his double barrel on one shoulder and his bunch of game slung over the other If you are all ready come on said he But what are you going to do with the rest of those ducks I am not going to do anything with them If it is too much trouble for you to ship them to the city and make forty cents a pair out of them you had better leave them where they are I ve got all I want Oscar looked first at his friend then at the ducks and finally began packing them away in the wheelbarrow with the others while Sam struck up a lively whistle to keep from laughing outright He had done his best shooting that day on purpose to make a large bag fully intending that Oscar should ship the surplus birds and receive pay for them and this was the way he took to accomplish his object Indeed he almost always found a way to make Oscar do just as he wanted him to do Having placed the game in the hands of the express agent at the depot and sent a notice of shipment to Calkins Son the two boys started for home well satisfied with their day s sport CHAPTER X AN ASTOUNDING OFFER Oscar was very tired when he reached home that night but he spent some hours at his bench before he went to bed He was anxious to have his case of birds ready for delivery by the time it had been promised So as soon as he had eaten his supper and answered all the questions his mother had to ask regarding the man he and Sam had saved from drowning he lighted the lamp in his shop and went to work Everything being ready to his hand he made rapid progress and when he locked his shop at ten o clock he told himself that by Monday at noon if nothing unforeseen happened the case would be safely mounted in Mr Jackson s dining room And so it was It was finished at eight o clock and Oscar who was a good judge of such matters declared with no little satisfaction that he had never seen a finer piece of work There was one thing about it that did not look just right and the boy wondered what Mr Jackson would say when he saw it The wheelbarrow was again brought into requisition and the case having been placed upon it and covered with a sheet to protect it from the dust Oscar trundled it off toward Mr Jackson s house His pull at the bell was answered by that gentleman himself who not being an early riser had not yet eaten his breakfast He assisted Oscar to carry the case through the hall and place it upon the little side table on which it was to stand and when the sheet had been removed he stood off and looked at it critically Then he called Miles and all the rest of his family in to pass judgment upon it It is just what I wanted Oscar said Mr Jackson at length and you could not improve it in any way It is splendid and I am entirely satisfied Hold on here what s this He walked close up to the case and placed his finger on one of the panes of glass opposite a bird in resplendent plumage with a green and purple crest marked with two narrow lines of white That s a very pretty bird continued Mr Jackson but what is he doing up there You wouldn t put any woodcock or snipe in the tree because you said they didn t belong there and now you ve gone and put a duck in it What sort of work is that That bird does belong there said Oscar I shot him out of a tree Mr Jackson was well posted in drugs but he knew nothing of natural history He looked toward Miles for an explanation but as the latter was no better acquainted with birds and their habits than his uncle was he could give him no information I ll take him out of there if you wish me to do so and put a grouse in his place said Oscar Oh no replied Mr Jackson quickly If he belongs there let him stay but I never saw a duck in a tree Sit down and have some coffee with us Thank you sir I had my breakfast three hours ago You did exclaimed Mr Jackson as he followed Oscar through the hall toward the front door Well I never could see any sense in eating during the night You will have the dyspepsia some day if you don t stop it There s your money and good by if you must go Miles he continued as he came back into the dining room where the rest of the family were seated at the table what sort of work would you make of it if you were turned loose in the world as that boy is and had no one to depend on but yourself I am sure I don t know replied Miles I hope I shall never be in that situation So do I said his uncle I hope you will associate with Oscar all you can for his influence and example will help any boy If you hear anything said against his honesty I hope you will have pluck enough to resent it on the spot Oh I don t think that anyone will ever hear another word said about his stealing money exclaimed Miles recalling the exciting interview which he and his friend Sam had had with Mr Smith on the previous Friday Then believing that he ought to give some reason for thinking so he added It wouldn t be safe to slander Oscar for Sam Hynes says he will thrash any fellow who does it He s another good one a little too blunt sometimes but as true as steel observed Mr Jackson I can t quite understand why Oscar put a duck in that tree I believe he has made a mistake and I am going to find out about it And he did While he was on the way to his store he met a tall dignified gentleman who stopped to exchange a few words with him It was Mr Chamberlain the principal of the High School The two men had met on that very street at that very hour and near that same spot every day except Saturdays and Sundays for more than a year The principal was the best educated man in town and a good many hard nuts were brought to him to crack You know everything professor said Mr Jackson after the usual greetings had been exchanged but you never knew of a duck being shot out of a tree did you Certainly was the unexpected answer The wood duck of Audubon commonly called summer duck It is the most beautiful species of the duck family and reflects all the colors of the rainbow It never makes its nest upon the ground but always in some hollow tree that hangs over the water As soon as the young are hatched they throw themselves down into the stream below without the least injury There goes the first bell Good morning Mr Jackson I ve learned something thought the druggist as he continued his walk toward the store Oscar was right when he put that duck in the tree It beats me where that boy found time to pick up so much information about birds and things Meanwhile Oscar with his forty dollars in his pocket was trundling his wheelbarrow merrily over the sidewalk toward home He wanted first to place his money in his mother s hands he thought it would be safer there than in his pocket and then he intended to go down to Mr Peck s boat house after the decoys sail and oars he had left there on Saturday He placed his wheelbarrow in the front yard but when he tried to open the door he found it was locked Mother has gone over to visit some of the neighbors thought he I ll stay here until she comes back I ve got the key of the shop in my pocket and I can find plenty to do there During the time Oscar had worked in the store the shop had not been kept as neat and tidy as it usually was The tools he had found time to use now and then were scattered about over the bench the shavings and dust had accumulated everywhere and it was a good hour s work to straighten up things But it was work that Oscar liked to do and he whistled merrily as he set about it Bugle meanwhile stationing himself in the open door and keeping a close watch over everybody that passed along the street Presently he uttered a loud bay and sprang out into the yard Oscar knowing that somebody was coming hurried to the door to see who it was and discovered the hound following at the heels of a little dried up man who was coming around the house toward the shop It was the same man he and Sam Hynes had found clinging to the rudder of the wrecked sail boat Oscar knew him at once for he still wore Sam s cap on his head Come here Bugle shouted Oscar Don t be afraid of him sir He is friendly even to strangers Good morning exclaimed the visitor I knocked at the front door but no one answered my summons I heard someone whistling however so I made bold to come around here Mother went out while I was absent replied Oscar I am glad to see you again sir and hope you did not suffer any inconvenience from your cold bath on Saturday Will you walk in I have a fire in here I am sorry I can t take you into the house The visitor made no reply whatever He came into the wood shed stopped in front of the door that gave entrance into the shop and said I believe your name is ah is ah He thrust his hand into the inside pocket of his coat and pulled out a small notebook Opening it he began turning over the leaves to find Oscar s name which the miller had given him on Saturday The book was filled with writing and on every page the visitor seemed to find something that he wanted to remember for he stopped to read it over in a half audible tone before turning to the next one Oscar stood there in the door of the shop with the broom in his hand for fully five minutes waiting for him to say something Your name is Oscar Preston said the visitor at length and you are the boy who rendered me a very important service two days ago I am the one who caught you as you were sinking but I never could have brought you into the boat if it hadn t been for Sam Hynes replied Oscar He did not want all the honor himself for the absent Sam who was at that moment puzzling his brains over his Vergil was entitled to a good share of it and Oscar intended that he should have it The visitor however seemed to think that the boy who had kept him from sinking was the one who deserved all the credit and he did not act as though he heard Sam s name mentioned I am greatly indebted to you my young friend he continued and I regret that I cannot reward you as you deserve My name is Potter and I am president of the Yarmouth University I was down the river in search of some specimens of the Fuligula Valisneria which I am told are now and then to be found here Oh that s what he went after is it thought Oscar Well I am no wiser than I was before I don t know what those things are and it is no wonder that Mr Hall and Mr Peck didn t understand him I became bewildered and was obliged to pass the night alone upon an island without food or fire continued the visitor In the morning I attempted to reach the village but the wind overturned the boat and I lost a valuable gun and all the equipments belonging to one of the faculty who had kindly loaned it to me Perhaps it was just as well after all for I was afraid to use it having never fired a gun in my life although I hoped to gain courage enough to discharge it if I saw an opportunity to secure a specimen or two Your name is here he consulted his notebook again Oscar Preston and I am informed that you are an expert taxidermist I am an amateur taxidermist sir answered Oscar I do not claim to be an expert I have a few specimens which I shall be glad to show you if you are interested in such things Will you walk in Oscar deposited his broom in one corner and drew aside the curtain concealing the recess in which his birds and animals were placed The professor entered and instantly seemed to become entirely unconscious of Oscar s presence so engrossed was he with what he saw before him He stopped in front of each bird and talked to it in an undertone and finally he began to speak his words aloud so that Oscar could understand them Ah said he a very fine specimen of the order Rasores family Tetraonid vulgo partridge the Tetrao Umbellus of Linn us and the Bonasia Umbellus of Bonaparte which is incorrect This is a specimen of the order Insessores family Ampelid genus Bombycilla Carolinensis Very finely mounted I should say much better than some of the specimens we have at the university All these hard words were rolled off without the least hesitation and it was evident that the professor had them at his tongue s end Oscar listened in genuine amazement and then seizing a piece of pine board that happened to be lying near him on the bench hastily wrote something upon it with a pencil he drew from his pocket and moved up a little closer to his visitor so that he could catch every word he said Young man said the latter do you know anything about comparative anatomy No sir replied Oscar who had never heard this expression before You ought to study it continued the professor for it belongs to your business If you will give a scientist a single bone he can build the skeleton of the beast or bird to which that bone belongs although he may never have seen it The species may even be extinct Some of my students once brought me a bone they had found in the woods and which they thought was the bone of a mastodon of the order Pachydermata but it proved to belong to one of the order Ruminantia being the bone of an ox Oscar wrote two words more on his board and waited for the professor to go on and when he did go on Oscar heard something for which he was not at all prepared and which astonished him beyond measure I think you are the person we want continued the visitor He stood with his hands behind his back and his spectacles on the end of his nose looking up at the specimens on the shelves and he seemed to be talking more to himself than to Oscar A generous and public spirited citizen of Yarmouth has given to our university a hundred thousand dollars which is to be expended in founding as fine a museum as that amount of money will pay for The birds and animals of our country are to be represented first mounted in a life like manner and looking if possible as natural as they do in their wild haunts Those of other countries are to be taken in hand afterward We have already gathered a few specimens though in a desultory way and some of them are declared by experts to be very imperfect Of the order Ruminantia family Cervid we have obtained but one species the Cervus Virginianus Oscar wrote these words on his board He could easily do it for his visitor did not seem to be paying the least attention to him We have the Alces Americanus and the Cervus Tarandus as well as the hollow horned ruminants of which there is but one species in this country as you are no doubt aware yet to procure Of the Digitigrades family Canid we have but one the red fox We should be willing to give something handsome for a gray cross or black fox Of the Plantigrades we have two Ursus Americanus and Procyon lotor We should like a specimen of the Ursus horribilis and the Ursus maritimus and also of the cinnamon bear which seems to be gaining some notoriety for voracity and fierceness but I don t suppose that a boy of your years would care to face animals of that description We have been trying to engage an accomplished taxidermist who is at the same time a successful hunter to work for us for a term of years at a stated salary but thus far we have not succeeded in our object for the reason that those to whom we have applied demand more money than the committee in whose hands the matter is placed think they can afford to pay We are quite willing to give a hundred dollars a month and expenses provided the collector is willing to go where we want to send him but more than that we could not promise under the terms on which the money was given to us Ah here s a Digitigrade he exclaimed when he discovered the fox which was one of Oscar s first specimens Now if you think you can afford to work for us for that amount of money we shall be glad to employ you I know that the committee will indorse any bargain I may make with you but in order to make assurance doubly sure perhaps I had better consult with them before we come to any definite understanding Oscar had stood with his board in one hand and his pencil in the other ready to note down as many of the visitor s hard words as he could catch but while he listened his hands gradually fell until they rested by his side and when the professor ceased speaking he backed up against his work bench and leaned heavily upon it The astounding offer of a hundred dollars a month and expenses almost knocked him over CHAPTER XI MR SMITH MAKES AMENDS You are not engaged in any regular occupation now I believe continued the professor No sir I am not answered Oscar as soon as he could speak Then I suggest that you keep yourself at liberty until you hear from some of us I shall return to the city by the first train and as soon as I can see the committee our secretary will drop you a line I am confident that I can put you in the way of making a name and a living for yourself Good morning The professor disappeared through the door and Oscar having seen him close the gate behind him drew a long breath thrust his hands deep into his pockets and walked up and down the shop thinking over what had transpired He was so highly excited that he could not have kept still to save his life It hardly seemed possible that the art of taxidermy which he had taken up simply as a recreation should be the means of making him rich and famous and he could not bring himself to believe that such was the fact There was one thing that stood in his way Everybody who came in contact with his late visitor seemed to think that there was something wrong with him and Oscar himself had seen and heard enough to prove that the professor was a very strange man Perhaps his name wasn t Potter and perhaps too he had no connection whatever with the Yarmouth University I ll not build any hopes upon it said the boy as these thoughts passed through his mind and neither will I say a word to mother when she comes home She would be very much disappointed if it turned out to be a hoax and I don t see how she can stand any more trouble Sam will be around some time to day most likely and I ll ask him what he thinks about it He has good sound sense and besides he knows how to keep a secret Oscar picked up his broom again but very soon found that he had lost interest in everything except Professor Potter and his astonishing proposition He could not keep his mind on anything else nor could he calm his excitement and believing that a brisk walk in the open air would be more agreeable than working in the dusty shop he locked the door picked up his wheelbarrow as he passed through the yard and set out for Mr Peck s boat house Bugle leading the way He found his decoys sail and oars where he had left them and having packed them away in his wheelbarrow he turned his face toward home As he was passing across the park he heard someone calling to him He stopped and looking across the street saw Mr Anderson running toward him and beckoning with his hand What does he want I wonder thought the boy I don t care to see him but if he wants to see me he can come where I am He set down the wheelbarrow and taking his seat on one of the handles looked at Mr Anderson who stopped in the middle of the street and waved his hand to him Come over here he shouted I can t see it said Oscar to himself I have been insulted in that store once and I never want to see the inside of it again If he has anything to say to me we ll have the interview right here for this is neutral ground Oscar kept his seat on the wheelbarrow and resting his elbows on his knees looked up and down the street in an indifferent sort of way as if he meant to show that Mr Anderson and his movements did not interest him in the least The junior partner finding that the boy paid no attention to his words and signals came across the street and hurried up to him Our hero was astonished at his greeting He thrust out his hand and Oscar placed his own within it I am glad to see you again said Mr Anderson cheerfully It looks natural to see you around Come over to the store Mr Smith has something very particular to say to you I guess I had better not go replied Oscar I am not in your employ now and I may say something I shall be sorry for No you won t for the opportunity will not be given you exclaimed Mr Anderson earnestly You ll have no cause for saying hard things Be guided by me just this once and come in You will never regret it Oscar took a few minutes in which to think about it Finally he arose to his feet and pushing his wheelbarrow off the walk out of the way he followed the junior partner across the street and into the store When they entered the office Mr Anderson closed and locked the door Mr Smith occupied his usual place on his high stool but he scrambled down from it with great haste and gave his former clerk a most cordial welcome Oscar said he I find that I have done you very great injustice and I am sorry for it The boy s face relaxed on the instant Knowing Mr Smith as well as he did he had never expected him to make such a confession as this Then perhaps you wouldn t mind telling me why I was discharged and why you refused to give me the letter of recommendation for which I asked said Oscar Mr Smith cleared his throat two or three times and climbed back to his high stool again It was hard work for him to answer that question and when he met the gaze of the clear honest eyes that were looking straight into his own he wondered how he could ever have suspected their owner of being a thief Well the amount of it is that somebody has been robbing our till systematically said he when he had mustered up courage enough to give utterance to the words All our clerks except you had been with us for a long term of years We had the utmost confidence in their honesty and and And you suspected me exclaimed Oscar his face reddening with indignation Well yes that s the plain English of it But we have since found out that we made a woeful mistake The guilty one has been discovered and has made a full confession in which he took particular pains to clear you of all suspicion Now we are anxious to make all the amends in our power Do you want to come back here at thirty dollars a month No sir replied Oscar promptly The two grocers seemed very much surprised at this answer They looked at each other and at Oscar as if they were waiting for him to say something more but as he did not speak Mr Smith continued Then we ll say thirty five and that is almost double the amount we paid you before I am very much obliged to you but I cannot accept the offer answered Oscar You do not bear us any ill will I hope said Mr Anderson None whatever I assure you I am overjoyed to know that you no longer believe me to be dishonest and I shall think of you with as kindly feelings as I ever did but I can t come back to the store for I have something better in prospect For your sake I am very glad to hear it for my own I am sorry said Mr Smith and the words came from his heart If the time ever comes when we can advance your interests in any way do not hesitate to call upon us You are at perfect liberty to use the firm s name whenever it will be of benefit to you We know you to be an honest capable boy and we shall take pleasure in recommending you as such I am greatly obliged to you sir and I may some day be glad to take advantage of your kind offer Now I will bid you good by Just one word more Oscar said Mr Anderson as the boy laid his hand upon the door knob if you don t secure that better thing of which you were speaking remember that your old position is open to you At thirty five dollars a month chimed in Mr Smith Thank you I ll bear it in mind Oscar s excitement which had been worked up to almost fever heat by the conversation he had had with the professor in his work shop that morning was greatly increased by this interview but still he managed to keep a few of his wits about him and when he passed out into the store he ran his eyes hastily around to see if any of the clerks were missing They were all there except one I m glad to see you Oscar cried Hudson the oldest clerk in the store You look as happy as a clam Coming back It is hardly probable was the reply Where s Stuart Stuart has been sick in bed ever since Friday something like brain fever I think answered Hudson He works here yet I suppose Oh yes he ll be back as soon as he gets well And I ll tell you something Preston which surprised me when I first found it out Mr Smith s got a heart I heard him say that Stuart s wages would go right on It is very strange thought Oscar as he closed the door behind him None of the clerks have been discharged so the till tapper whoever he is must still be in the store I was dismissed when there was not the least proof against me and now a confessed thief is allowed to retain his situation I don t see much justice in that Well perhaps the guilty fellow is one of their trusted men and Smith Anderson don t want to make any stir about it Morning Oscar exclaimed the post office clerk who just then hurried by with his face buried in the collar of his overcoat Letter in your box Oscar thanking him for the information turned down the street and crossed over to the post office and all the while he seemed to be treading on air so light and buoyant were his spirits He had heard good news from two sources that forenoon and there was something else agreeable in store for him as he found when the letter was placed in his hands It proved to be from Calkins Son who acknowledged the receipt in good order of the eighteen brace of ducks that had been sent to them on Saturday asked for a shipment of grouse quails or hares at once and enclosed their check for made payable to Oscar s order After reading the letter he put it into his pocket seized the wheelbarrow which now seemed as light as a feather and trundled it home in much less time than he had ever consumed in making the journey before He let himself into the shop and while he was busy putting away his decoys a lively whistle sounded in the yard and Sam Hynes came rushing in O Sam exclaimed Oscar Hallo What s the matter with you demanded the visitor who saw that his friend was greatly excited about something I ve had the best luck in the world to day answered Oscar In the first place the fellow who got me into all that trouble with Smith Anderson has been discovered and has made a full confession No cried Sam opening his eyes and looking very much surprised It s a fact Mr Smith informed me not an hour ago that he had done me great injustice and he was sorry for it You don t tell me so cried Sam seating himself on the bench and looking the very picture of amazement and delight Who was the guilty rascal I don t know and I couldn t find out I didn t ask Mr Smith and he didn t volunteer the information The clerks were busy in the store to day and they were all there except Stuart He is ill and will come back as soon as he gets well so the thief whoever he is still holds his position Sam was really astonished now and the delight he feigned became genuine when Oscar continued Mr Smith told me that my old situation was open to me at thirty five dollars a month Good exclaimed Sam jumping off the bench and extending his hand When do you go back I am not going back at all I have something better Sam opened his eyes again and listened attentively while Oscar went on to describe the interview he had had with Professor Potter and to tell him of the liberal offer the latter had made him He did not forget to inform his friend that the professor still wore his Sam s cap on his head and that he had probably carried it to the city with him As Oscar proceeded with his story the look of astonishment on Sam s face gradually gave way to an altogether different expression and when Oscar ceased speaking he seated himself on the bench again and gazed down at the floor in a brown study Now then what s the matter with you demanded Oscar If I answer your question at all I shall say just what I think replied Sam That is what I want you to do Speak out I will You have missed it If you are wise you will lose no time in telling Mr Smith that you will take those thirty five dollars a month But Sam I can t do it I promised the professor that I would keep myself free until I heard from him Professor exclaimed Sam with great disgust He is about as much a professor as I am If you had heard him talk this morning you wouldn t think so I tell you he is educated That may be but a man who will go on as he did when we pulled him out of the water and who hasn t sense enough to know when he is wearing a cap belonging to somebody else can t have much wit Professor He never saw Yarmouth University and you ll never hear from him again either What have you got there added Sam glancing at a piece of wood which his companion just then took from the work bench I wrote down some of his hard words replied Oscar passing the board over to Sam You are fresh from your books and I d like to have you translate them for me I ll tell you what s a fact I have come to the conclusion that I don t know anything about natural history He talked in a regular scientific style didn t he said Sam after he had run his eyes over the board The animal kingdom as you know is divided into branches classes orders families genera and species The branch Vertebrates is divided into five classes fishes batrachians reptiles birds and mammalia The class birds is divided into seven orders two of which you have put down here The Rasores are scratchers such as the turkey and grouse and the Insessores are perchers To this order belong all our songbirds Well he went down the river after some specimens of the Fuligula Valisneria said Oscar What are they That s a conundrum replied Sam What s a Bombycilla Carolinensis I give it up There are only a few words more here that I can understand and Oscar I ll say this much for you your spelling is simply fearful The Pachydermata are thick skinned animals such as the elephant and rhinoceros the Ruminantia are those that chew the cud like the cow and sheep the Digitigrades walk on their toes the cat and dog belong to this family and the Plantigrades walk on their heels To this family the bear belongs That is as far as I can help you But I ll tell you what we will do added Sam jumping down from the bench and pulling out his watch I ll be around here to night within fifteen minutes after school is dismissed and you go home and take supper with me In the early part of the evening I ll beat you playing a game of chess and then we ll go over and call on Mr Chamberlain He will make everything clear to you I don t believe you have been near him since you left school No I haven t answered Oscar I was obliged to neglect everybody while I was in the store I ll be ready for you Sam rushed out slamming the door behind him and hurried toward the gate but just then Oscar happened to think of something so he ran to the door and called him back CHAPTER XII AN EVENING WITH THE PRINCIPAL I will detain you but a moment Sam exclaimed Oscar I have received a check from Calkins Son for to pay for the ducks we killed on Saturday Good for Calkins Son replied Sam If they are always as prompt as that they are the men we want to deal with Half of it belongs to you you know Yes I know it answered Sam once more turning his face toward the gate You act as my banker and when I want my share I ll make out a draft for it Hold on Sam shouted Oscar who knew very well what this meant I ll do nothing of the kind Oscar you are the most stubborn fellow I ever had anything to do with said Sam shaking his finger at his friend and utterly ignoring the fact that he had never been known to give up to Oscar in a single instance I never saw so obstinate a boy you want your own way all the time Now put that check in your pocket and keep it there If it is too much trouble for you to do that give it to the poor Good by and be ready for me at a quarter past four Sam turned down the street and set off at a rapid trot He had just time enough left to eat his dinner and reach the school house before the last bell rang If there is a confiding fellow in the world it is that Oscar Preston said he to himself as he ran along That crazy man has bamboozled him completely I was sorry to dash all his bright hopes to the ground but I thought he ought to be waked up to the real facts of the case I never saw a boy look so sorrowful and downhearted as he did when I told him what I thought about it I wish from the bottom of my heart it was an offer he could depend on Wouldn t he be in clover though A hundred dollars a month and expenses for travelling about the country shooting birds and animals Just think of it Oscar watched his friend as long as he remained in sight and then leaning his elbows on the work bench he rested his chin upon his hands and looked thoughtfully out of the window toward the evergreen screen behind the house He was by no means as cheerful and hopeful as he had been a short half hour before His crony s visit had depressed his spirits wonderfully but Sam was not to blame for that He had asked him what he thought of the president s proposition and Sam as he always did had answered his question promptly and in language that could not possibly be misunderstood Perhaps Sam was right and he would never again hear of the man who had called himself President Potter Oscar had resolved more than once that day that he would not build any hopes upon the offer he had received but in spite of all his efforts his thoughts would dwell upon it and every little while he found himself indulging in some rosy dreams of the future Would it not be a good plan to take Sam s advice and tell Mr Smith that he would go back to the store for the wages he had of his own free will offered to give him The thirty five dollars a month he was sure of the larger sum he was not sure of While he was thinking about it his mother came to the door and called him to dinner The first thing Oscar did when he entered the dining room was to place in his mother s hands the money he had been paid by Mr Jackson and the check he had received from Calkins Son but he said not a word to her regarding the interviews he had held with Professor Potter and Mr Smith He could not describe these interviews without telling of the propositions that had been made him and he did not want to do that until he had determined upon something He wanted time to look at the matter from every possible standpoint and he found ample opportunity to do it that afternoon for he spent very little time in work He went back to the shop as soon as he had eaten his dinner but he could find nothing there to interest him He finished sweeping out and rearranged his specimens on the shelves but it was all done by snatches He would work a few minutes and then he would walk up and down the shop with his eyes fastened upon the floor When four o clock came his chores were all done and having exchanged his working clothes for a neat business suit he was ready to accompany Sam to his home where he passed a few hours in the most agreeable manner Everybody who visited there said that Mr Hynes s house was one of the pleasantest and happiest in Eaton and Oscar had always found it so It was just the place to go when one was troubled with the blues as our hero had been all that afternoon Sam s father and mother were very jolly people and his sister besides being a fine singer and pianist played chess so well that Oscar who was sometimes given to boasting of his own skill was often badly worsted Seven o clock came almost before the boys knew it and then they put on their caps and set out to visit the principal of the High School Ringing the bell at his door they were ushered into the library where Mr Chamberlain sat with his slippered feet on the fender and the evening s paper in his hand He greeted Oscar very cordially for the latter had been one of his favorite pupils He had never been known to break one of the rules of school and had never been reprimanded He went to school to learn and for no other purpose Do you know such a boy If you do you know one whom all his teachers like I am glad to see you again Oscar said Mr Chamberlain as he shook his visitors warmly by the hand and placed chairs for them and I must congratulate you on your good fortune I knew it would come after awhile Thank you sir replied Oscar wondering how the gentleman had heard of it It never does any good to allow ourselves to get discouraged continued Mr Chamberlain sinking back into his easy chair It is always darkest just before daylight you know I must say that I am surprised as well as delighted So am I sir returned Oscar I never expected that he would make an acknowledgment even though he received the most positive proof that he had been mistaken Acknowledgment repeated Mr Chamberlain Who made any acknowledgment What are you talking about Oscar Why I thought you referred to what passed between Mr Smith and myself to day replied the boy I hadn t heard anything about that Has Mr Smith found out that he did you injustice I am glad of it said Mr Chamberlain upon receiving an affirmative nod from Sam I knew that would come too You may have the satisfaction of knowing that not a single one of your friends ever believed anything wrong against you I may also say he added with a smile looking toward Sam who blushed to the roots of his hair that some of your acquaintances hold very strong opinions on that point and that those opinions have been enforced with the aid of a ball club But I was speaking of the offer you received from President Potter He called on you this morning did he not Do you know him Mr Chamberlain exclaimed Sam Certainly I do He was my old preceptor and my guest while he was in Eaton But is he really president of the Yarmouth University He certainly is What else did you take him for I took him for a crazy man replied Sam bluntly A crazy man Sam I am surprised at you Well now Mr Chamberlain if you had been in our boat and had heard him talk when we pulled him out of the water you would have thought so yourself if you had been a stranger to him With this introduction Sam went on to repeat the speech the professor had made while he was lying on the bottom of Oscar s skiff He had paid particular attention to it and could recall it word for word That is just like him said Mr Chamberlain If he were lecturing a class in this room to night and the house should catch fire he wouldn t leave off until the smoke or flames drove him out He becomes so completely absorbed in his subject that he doesn t seem to hear or see anything and I have known mischievous students to steal out of the class room one after another until there were not more than three or four left and he never missed them If I had not called his attention to the fact that he had Sam s cap on his head he would have worn it to Yarmouth when he went away this afternoon Sam you will find the article in question on the hat rack when you go home I d like to ask one question before I forget it said Oscar Is it possible that there are men who by looking at a single bone can give you the name of the beast or bird to which that bone belongs Mr Potter told me to day that some of his students once brought him a bone they had found in the woods and which they supposed to be the bone of a mastodon but it proved to be the bone of an ox Mr Chamberlain leaned his head against the back of his chair looked up at the ceiling and laughed until his eyes were filled with tears I wonder if the professor still remembers that little incident said he If my memory serves me I used to be pretty well acquainted with that same student He knew very well that the bone did not belong to a mastodon but he thought he would test the old gentleman s knowledge It is hardly necessary to say that he was entirely satisfied with the result of the experiment and had the laugh turned on him completely by the other students who were in the plot There was something in Mr Chamberlain s tone that made the two boys smile at each other They believed that if the principal had given the name of that student he would have given one that sounded very much like his own name The professor told me to day that he had offered you a hundred dollars a month and all expenses to procure specimens for the university museum continued Mr Chamberlain addressing himself to Oscar and you may rest assured that you will get it Mr Potter has a hundred thousand dollars to spend in that way and I see no reason why you should not earn a good portion of it You have a number of years of steady employment before you at more than living wages if you are inclined to accept this offer The boys listened to these words with the greatest amazement and it is hard to tell which of the two was the more delighted thereat Sam was overjoyed to learn that he had been mistaken in the opinions he had formed and could hardly refrain from jumping up and tossing his cap into the air As for Oscar he blessed his lucky stars that he had not accepted Mr Smith s offer as he had more than once been tempted to do that afternoon Mr Chamberlain said Sam as soon as he had controlled his excitement so that he could talk intelligibly what is a a where s that list Oscar The latter produced a piece of paper on which he had copied the hard words he had written on his pine board that morning that is all that Sam had not been able to translate for him and handed it to his companion who passed it over to the principal Mr Chamberlain glanced at the first words on the list and shook his head Perhaps I haven t spelled them correctly observed Oscar They are the things the professor went down the river after on Saturday chimed in Sam Oh the Fuligula Valisneria exclaimed Mr Chamberlain That is the canvas back duck Ah said both boys in concert The family Canid is the dog family said Mr Chamberlain turning again to the list The family Tetraonid is the grouse family and Tetra Umbellus is the ruffed grouse which almost everybody calls a partridge In the South the quail is called a partridge and the grouse is called a pheasant I hope you boys will never allow yourselves to fall into such habits You can t begin too early in life to call things by their right names To the family Ampelid belong the chatterers Bombycilla Carolinensis is the cedar bird The Cervid comprise the deer family and Cervus Virginianus is our common red deer the hollow horned ruminants are the antelopes There is only one species in the United States and that is the pronghorn of our Western plains If you should go out there to hunt him you would see no end of sport Oscar and I suppose no end of hard times I hope you will not expect to find it all plain sailing simply because you have stepped into an agreeable and profitable situation Ursus Americanus is the American black bear Ursus horribilis you mustn t have anything to do with him that s the grizzly bear the most dangerous and dreaded animal in the country Ursus maritimus that s the polar bear is almost as bad The names on that list include the animals they want in their museum said Sam and Oscar will be obliged to hunt them if they tell him to do so Would you dare do it asked Mr Chamberlain looking at Oscar I don t know sir My courage has never been put to the test But I will say this If they will give me a chance to work around home until I can earn money enough to support my mother while I m gone I ll start for the plains or for Africa within twenty four hours after I receive their order I like that spirit said Mr Chamberlain If you are going into a thing go into it as though you were alive and wide awake By the way The principal laid down the list and arose to his feet Opening his bookcase he took from it two large and finely bound volumes which he placed upon the table at Oscar s elbow When you go home take these books with you said he Keep them as long as they are of any use to you and they will tell you everything you want to know about birds and animals scientific names and all I have the best of reasons for saying that you will be summoned to Yarmouth in the course of a few days to pass a sort of examination before the committee and I want you to acquit yourself with honor so if I were in your place I would spend all my spare time in cramming CHAPTER XIII THE BLACK FOX Oscar thanked the principal warmly for his advice and for the interest he took in his affairs and just then the little clock on the mantle chimed the hour of nine The boys having promised to be at their respective homes by that time bade Mr Chamberlain good night and hurried out Sam taking possession of his cap as he passed through the hall What do you think of the situation now inquired Oscar when the gate had been closed behind them Sam stopped and by way of reply seized his companion s hand giving it a grip and a shake that would have made almost any other boy double up with pain I never wanted to yell so badly in my life as I did when Mr Chamberlain told us that that crazy man was just what he represented himself to be said Sam I ll hold in until we have our next practice game of ball or until you and I go down the river again and then won t I make things ring Say Oscar when you are knocking over that big game right and left you ll think of a fellow won t you Indeed I will Sam How much I wish you could go with me if I go Oh you ll go you need have no fears on that score exclaimed Sam with great enthusiasm I should like to be hanging on to the sleeve of your jacket about the time you catch sight of your first antelope but it isn t to be thought of I must be in Harvard by a year from next fall if I have brains enough to get there Father has set his heart upon it and as he is the very best father any boy ever had I wouldn t disappoint him for the world Of course not said Oscar Now Sam I want to ask you a question What have you been doing Nothing nothing whatever said his companion promptly I have read somewhere Oscar that the way those fellows on the plains hunt the pronghorn is to That won t do Sam interrupted Oscar I want to talk about another matter You have been hitting somebody with a ball club No I haven t honor bright exclaimed Sam with a great show of earnestness I never in my life hit anything with a ball club except the ball and the home base Why man alive I d be afraid to do it The boys had by this time reached Sam s home which was but a few steps from Mr Chamberlain s house As Sam was about to open the gate Oscar shut it with a bang and placed his back against it After that he put his books upon the top of the gate post and stood ready to resist any attempt his companion might make to pull him away from his position Hallo here cried Sam with well feigned astonishment What do you mean by that performance Won t you let me go in No sir I won t not unless you can pull me away from here and I don t know whether you can do that or not I don t either replied Sam backing off and putting his hands in his pockets so I ll not try But it is after nine o clock and I ought to be in bed and fast asleep Some of the folks might come out here to look for me I know they might but they won t Now what have you been doing with that ball club I know you have been up to something for your face got as red as a beet when Mr Chamberlain spoke about it I never saw so obstinate and persistent a fellow as you are when you once get your mind set on a thing said Sam leaning his elbow on the fence and trying to look like a boy who was very badly persecuted I punched him with it if you must know There I told you that you had been hitting somebody But I say I didn t hit him protested Sam I only poked him in the ribs with the end of it Him Who Leon Parker And got yourself into trouble by it for Mr Chamberlain kept you after school and gave you a good talking to Well I guess that was about the way of it said Sam reflectively What did you poke him in the ribs for Because he had too much to say about well he had too much to say Look here Sam said Oscar stepping up and laying his hand upon his companion s shoulder I am proud of your friendship and I know it will continue as long as you and I live I wouldn t say or do anything to hurt your feelings and I wish you would be equally careful of mine Now don t get yourself into trouble for me any more Oh it wasn t the least trouble in the world answered Sam purposely ignoring Oscar s meaning he thought his friend was becoming altogether too serious I poked him just as easy and I never hurt him a bit either Oscar was obliged to laugh in spite of himself Well promise me that you won t poke any more boys in the ribs with ball clubs because they talk about me for I know that was what Leon did said he I promise I ll never do it again assured Sam earnestly And whatever you do don t touch Leon Parker continued Oscar I owe a great deal to his father and I wouldn t have Leon hurt for anything He hasn t injured me by his talking and neither has anybody for not one of those whose friendship I prize has turned against me That s so assented Sam Well I suppose I must say good night Shall we take another trip down the river next Saturday I ll tell you what I d like to do replied Oscar I d like to make an effort to recover the gun the professor lost when his boat upset He said it was a borrowed piece and a very valuable one too I am with you We ll take the decoys along and then if the ducks happen to come our way we shall be all ready for them Good night I think I was quite safe in saying that I wouldn t trouble Leon anymore said Sam as he opened the front door and entered the house for the lesson I gave him a few days ago will teach him that he had better keep his slanderous tongue still A ball club is a pretty hard thing to push against a fellow s ribs that s a fact and I ll not do it any more I ll use my fist next time If Oscar had overheard this soliloquy he would have been compelled to acknowledge that he had not gained much by the promise he had extorted from his friend Sam The young taxidermist walked homeward with a light heart There was nothing now to prevent him from taking his mother into his confidence which he proceeded to do as soon as he had entered the house Mrs Preston listened attentively to his story and when it was finished she said with something like a sigh If that committee should decide to send you away from Eaton I should be very lonely for you are all I have now but if you and Mr Chamberlain think it is to your interest to accept this offer I have nothing to say against it I shall not throw a single obstacle in your way The boy was overjoyed to hear this He had been afraid that his mother might not be quite so well pleased with his prospects as he was and it would have been a sore disappointment if she had raised any objections to the plans he had determined upon Oscar did not settle down into a state of chronic inactivity as many boys would have done who had a clear hundred dollars a month in prospect Money was needed at once to pay part of the principal and all the interest that was due Mr Simpson and Oscar went manfully to work to earn it in the only way that was open to him He spent four days of that week in the woods with Bugle and every night a good sized bunch of grouse quails and hares was shipped to Calkins Son who on every second day sent him a check for his money The young hunter had never known game to be so abundant as it was that year and it was no more trouble for him to secure it than it would have been to sit in the house and do nothing He read and studied diligently every evening and made regular visits to the post office hoping to find there the letter the professor had promised to write him but it did not come When Friday afternoon arrived Oscar walked down to Mr Simpson s office and paid him one hundred dollars on the mortgage and thirty dollars for interest at six per cent He felt better after that and told himself that the old sharper s chances for gaining possession of his mother s house and lot were by no means as good as they had been As he was about to enter the gate he found the farmer who supplied his mother with wood just driving out of the yard Howdy Oscar exclaimed the man drawing up his team with a jerk Folks say you know all about varmints and things and I d like to have you tell me if a black fox is wuth more n any other kind I should say he was answered Oscar Have you got one Got him No I aint and that there is just what s the matter of me and my hens He won t leave one of em that there feller won t if you and Bugle don t come up to my house and shoot him We aint got no dogs wuth their salt and my boys can t somehow do nothing with him They ve tuk after him a time or two but laws they can t somehow get him to stick his foot into a trap nuther cause he s smarter than chain lightnin that there fox is Oscar became interested at once He was always on the lookout for such chances as this for they gave him an opportunity to try his skill and Bugle s He knew there were many good hunters and dogs in the farmer s neighborhood and an animal that could outwit them all must be cunning indeed And then he was a black fox Oscar remembered hearing the professor say that he would be willing to give something handsome for one of that species Have you ever seen him Mr Bacon he asked Seen him every morning fur a hull week was the reply and shot at him a time or two but laws he s blacker n that there nigh hoss of mine that fox is all except the tip end of his tail and that s whiter n snow He must be a beauty exclaimed Oscar I wish I had him Well come up there and shoot him you and Bugle why don t you Save the rest of my hens by knocking that there feller over and I ll give you as good a dinner as you ever eat in a farmhouse I ll try him on Monday if nothing happens to keep me at home but if he can get away from such hunters as I know your boys to be no doubt he will get away from me too Do you know anything about his runways What s them asked Mr Bacon Why a fox has regular courses which he always follows when he is started by a hound and they are just as plain to him and to a hunter who knows the country and understands the habits of the animal as this road is to you Those courses are called runways You can t keep up with a fox when he is running before the dogs and so you must get ahead of him and shoot him as he passes along one of these runways Mebbe there s sunthin in that there idee of your n said Mr Bacon after reflecting a moment I have always noticed that fox when he crosses from one side of the holler to the other takes to my medder and jumps the brook about thirty yards below that bridge in my lane The dogs always start him on that sugar loaf hill east of my house I reckin he s got a den up there and when he gets tired of foolin around that hill he crosses over to the west side of the holler jumpin the brook where I told you and that s the end of the hunt for them wuthless dogs of our n can t never find that fox agin that day I thank you for the information replied Oscar You have given me a start and I can find out the rest for myself All right Don t you forget to come up to my house and get sunthin to eat Mr Bacon cracked his whip and drove off and Oscar went into the house He put the string out of his window before he went to bed and at an early hour Sam awoke him by upsetting the chair Everything was ready for the start and as soon as Oscar had made a cup of coffee and a hasty breakfast had been disposed of the boys set out for the river As before they took the wheelbarrow with them and this time it contained in addition to the decoys sail and oars an iron drag with four long curved teeth which Oscar had ordered made at the blacksmith s This drag was made fast to a strong rope forty feet in length and was to be used in recovering the gun the professor had lost in the river just a week before The boys could not have wished for better luck than they had that day They shot several ducks on their way down the river and when they arrived off the head of Squaw Island and had made up their minds where it was that the professor s boat had been capsized Sam who sat in the stern threw the drag overboard while Oscar pulled the skiff about in circles The water was only about twenty feet deep the boys wished the weather was warmer so that they could dive for the lost fowling piece and the bottom was composed of smooth flat rocks over which the sharp teeth of the drag passed almost as easily as they would have passed over a floor Of course they would catch hold of something occasionally and stop the progress of the boat and then Sam would overhaul the rope very carefully only to find when the drag came to the surface that there was nothing on it At the third cast however his efforts were rewarded The drag struck against some object that offered but a very feeble resistance as Sam tugged at the rope He hauled in slowly and cautiously and in a few seconds brought to light the missing gun suspended by its trigger guard from one of the teeth of the drag Sam greeted it with a series of frightful yells flourishing it in triumph over his head then rubbed it briskly with an oiled rag which he drew from his game bag all the while making running comments upon the general appearance of the weapon and finally he passed it over to his companion Isn t it a beauty cried Oscar holding it off at arm s length and giving it a good looking over If it shoots as well as it looks it is certainly a valuable gun We have saved somebody a hundred and fifty dollars Yes and more remarked Sam It was made by Joe Manton the fashionable gun maker of England you can see his name on the barrels and never cost a cent less than three hundred When Oscar had admired the gun to his heart s content he picked up the oars again and pulled toward the island There were still a powder flask and shot pouch somewhere on the bottom of the river the professor had told Oscar that with the gun he had lost all the equipments but these articles could be replaced for so little money and the chances of picking them up with the drag were so few and far between that the boys did not think it worth while to waste time in looking for them They had recovered the gun and the owner would certainly be satisfied with that CHAPTER XIV WHO DESTROYED THE SNARES Arriving at the head of the island the decoys were set out and the boys took their positions behind the blind where they remained until three o clock that afternoon The shooting was all they could desire and when they returned home that night Oscar had thirty one and a half brace of ducks to ship to the city after Sam had taken out all he wanted for his own use The extra duck Oscar carried home for his next day s dinner and the others were duly forwarded to Calkins Son The first thing Oscar did after he had eaten his supper was to take the recovered shot gun into his shop and give it a thorough overhauling The loads were drawn Oscar laughed when he saw how small they were they would scarcely have ruffled the feathers of a mallard at ten paces the breech pins were unscrewed the locks taken to pieces and every part was oiled and rubbed until it shone like silver He worked upon it until ten o clock and when he put it together again no one would have supposed that it had lain for a whole week at the bottom of the river It could not have been in better order when it first came from the hands of the man who made it Oscar was up long before daylight on Monday morning and having eaten breakfast he set out with his gun on his shoulder and Bugle at his heels to try his luck with the black fox Now Reynard be on the alert Bring all your cunning into play and make use of every artifice known to you for you have no tyros to deal with to day Mr Bacon s farm was eight miles from the village by the road but by following a short cut across the hills three miles of this distance could be saved Of course Oscar took the nearer way for his experience had taught him that in foxhunting when one is sometimes obliged to run a mile or two through a thick wood in order to reach a runway before the game passes every step counts Bugle much to his disgust was kept at heel all the way for his master s heart was set upon securing a black fox and he had no time to waste with hares grouse or common red foxes Just as the sun was rising the young hunter came to a standstill upon the brink of a high bluff and saw below him the hollow in which Mr Bacon s farm was situated He had no difficulty in finding the sugar loaf hill for he knew right where to look for it When he reached it the hound was ordered to hunt em up and he was only too glad to do it He disappeared in the bushes while Oscar climbed slowly up the hill for a short distance and walked leisurely around it in a direction opposite to that taken by the dog Finally as he did not hear from Bugle he stopped in a little open space where he could command a view of an acre or two of the hillside and sat down to rest and await developments Ten minutes passed and then a long drawn bay which was so faint and far off that it was scarcely audible and which was repeated by the echoes until it seemed to sound from the hills on the other side of the hollow came to his ears whereupon Oscar arose to his feet placed his back against a tree and cocking both barrels of his gun held the weapon across his breast in such a position that it could be brought to his shoulder in an instant He did not get behind the tree and look around it for he knew that if he did he would surely be discovered by the fox should he chance to come that way He stood out in plain sight and that was the proper thing to do The hill proved to be a great deal larger than Oscar thought it was for more than an hour passed before Bugle came around to him but that he had struck a trail and a warm one too was evident judging by the way he gave tongue At last his deep toned bays began to ring out louder and clearer and then Oscar brought his gun to his shoulder and standing as motionless as a figure carved out of stone kept his eye moving about the clear space below him but the fox did not break cover He must have passed that way however for in a few minutes more Bugle dashed around the base of the hill giving tongue at every jump and started for another hour s run around the sugar loaf As soon as he was out of hearing Oscar put down the hammers of his gun and ran across the open space at the top of his speed I was on the right track thought he but not quite far enough down the hill Now I wish I knew where that fellow turns off when he makes up his mind to cross the hollow and go over to the hill on the other side Ah Here is where he passed If he tries that trick again he is my fox The exclamations were called forth by the discovery of a well beaten path which ran diagonally toward the summit of the hill A short examination of it showed the hunter that it had been made by Mr Bacon s sheep and his experience told him that the fox had followed that path in the hope of throwing off the hound Crossing newly ploughed fields where the scent will not lie walking on the top rail of fences wading in shallow brooks and running about among a flock of sheep or following a road along which they have recently passed are stratagems to which a cunning old fox will frequently resort to throw off the dogs that are pursuing his trail but Bugle was much too smart to be deceived by any such tricks and he had followed the fox up the path without the least trouble Being fully satisfied that he had found the right place at last Oscar stationed himself in front of a large tree that stood a short distance up the path and in such a position that he could look over the tops of the bushes that surrounded it and command a view of the trail for twenty yards on each side and patiently waited for Bugle to drive the fox around to him again It was a long time before he heard from the hound longer than before and then he heard but a few faint bays after which all was silent again The fox had left the sugar loaf and taken to another hill standing half a mile further down the hollow After playing around there for half an hour he came back to the hill he had left and started around it in a direction opposite to that he had at first followed Oscar s ears told him all this he could distinctly hear the hound whenever he rounded the base of the hill nearest the hollow and he prepared to act accordingly He moved a little further around his tree and keeping his gaze directed up the path cocked both barrels of his gun and drew it to his shoulder He had not occupied this position more than five minutes before the fox came in sight It was the one he was looking for as sure as the world for there was that white tip on the end of his tail and the rest of him was as black as jet He was taking matters very coolly trotting down the path as though he had no particular business on hand and the first thing that told him of the hunter s presence was the report of the gun which sent a charge of heavy shot into his head and breast He bounded high into the air and when he struck the ground again he rolled rapidly down the hill sending the twigs and withered leaves in every direction He struggled desperately to get upon his feet and continue his flight but he was too hard hit Oscar dashed down the hill after him and when he came up with the fox he found him lying motionless on a little pile of leaves which the winds had heaped against the side of a fallen log He had robbed his last henroost The boy picked him up and looked at him It was the first black fox he had ever seen but he had read and heard enough about the species to know that they were very rare and valuable and he was not a little elated over the success that had attended his hunt After loading his gun Oscar placed his prize on the ground where he could have a fair view of him and sat down on the log to admire him and wait for Bugle It was an hour or more before the hound appeared and his long absence accounted for the slow and deliberate movements of the fox The cunning animal had doubled on his trail and by making use of extra speed had placed such a distance between himself and his pursuer that haste was no longer necessary If left to himself he would probably have curled up in some warm spot and rested until the hound came within hearing when he would have jumped up and continued his flight When Bugle arrived on the ground he did not attempt to bite the fox as he generally did He simply smelt it wagged his tail vigorously in response to his master s caresses and words of praise and then stood off and looked up at him as if awaiting further orders We ll have something to eat old fellow before we do any more hunting said Oscar who always talked to his favorite as if the animal could understand every word he said We have earned a good dinner by this morning s work and we ll go and get it I declare it is ready now I had no idea it was so late Let s hurry up Oscar knew that dinner was ready because he heard signals exchanged between Mr Bacon s house and the field First a shrill female voice shouted Hooppee The call was repeated two or three times and then an answering Yeep uttered in deep masculine tones arose from the field below Oscar followed by Bugle hurried down the hill clambered over the fence and joined Mr Bacon and his two broad shouldered sons who had been at work repairing a stone wall They were on their way to the house but they stopped when they saw him coming and Mr Bacon discovering the prize he carried over his shoulder brought his hands together with a loud clap and shouted out a cordial welcome Well you done it didn t you he exclaimed That s the feller cause I d know him two mile off if I could see him that fur I told the boys I reckoned mebbe that was you a shootin up there an I had half a notion to send one on em up to see Come on now and get the dinner I promised you you and Bugle We ll fill him so full of meat that he won t do no more huntin this day that there hound dog won t Not meat please said Oscar it spoils a dog s nose Bugle has little besides corn bread and vegetables at home and he is entirely satisfied with his diet Well I reckon mebbe Johnnycake ll do him won t it Wife always has Johnnycake on Monday cause it s wash day you know When the farmer and his sons had examined Oscar s prize to their satisfaction and had told some remarkable stories of the skill he had exhibited in eluding his former pursuers Mr Bacon led the way toward the house His wife was loud in her praises and made Oscar laugh by declaring that she knowed that there fox was gone up when she heard that him and Bugle was goin to get after him Having performed his ablutions Oscar was shown to a seat at the table which fairly groaned under the weight of the good things that were piled upon it Mrs Bacon was sorry she hadn t something better to offer the successful sportsman but Oscar could see no necessity for any apologies It was not a picked up dinner if it was washing day He thought the farmer must have an idea that fox hunters were blessed with more than ordinary appetites for the plate that was passed over to him was filled so full that not another thing could have been placed upon it The meal was enlivened with conversation on various topics and when it was finished and the farmer had smoked his after dinner pipe Oscar picked up his fox and gun thanked Mrs Bacon for the good dinner she had given him and accompanied the three men to the field There he took leave of them and struck out across the hills toward home He was in no hurry now so he walked along very leisurely and picked up quite a respectable bag of game on the way Bugle drove three hares around to him and twice as many grouse fell to his double barrel At length when the increasing gloom of the woods told him that the day was drawing to a close Oscar tied his game together in a bunch with a strong cord he always carried in his game bag for that purpose called Bugle to him and set out at a brisk walk As he was working his way through a dense thicket on Mr Parker s hill farm he came suddenly upon two boys who just as he appeared in sight disappeared dropped a bundle of something behind a log and took to their heels One of them glanced over his shoulder as he ran and finally halted and faced about Don t be afraid Jeff he shouted to his retreating companion it s nobody but Oscar Preston Jeff stopped as soon as he could check his headlong flight and when he had satisfied himself as to the identity of the approaching hunter he came slowly back Oscar knew the two boys but he never had had anything to do with them They lived near the river and belonged to what the order loving portion of the villagers called a hard crowd What have you been up to asked Oscar as soon as he came within speaking distance Something mean I ll warrant No we haven t answered both the boys in concert We haven t been up to anything It was only necessary that Oscar should use his eyes to detect the falsehood One glance around explained everything The snares which Leon had worked so hard to build were all ruined Oscar knew that they were Leon s snares for no one else would be likely to build them on his father s grounds You are a contemptible couple said he indignantly although I don t know that one can expect you to be anything else What made you do it Well what made Leon shoot my tame pigeons the last time he was down to the river whined one of the boys He knowed they was mine but he plumped em over all the same I said I d spile something of his n some day to pay for it and I ve done it That s a pretty way to get even with him isn t it said Oscar I ve the best notion in the world to take you both by the neck and knock your heads together Did you find any birds in these snares Nary one and no rabbits neither What did you do with the triggers and strings We heaved em into the bushes as fur as we could and it s too dark to find em again Say Oscar you won t tell nobody about this will you That s a good feller No blarney now I ll tell you this much was Oscar s angry reply if I catch either of you in an act of this kind again I ll give you a shaking that will do your hearts good Now remember it So saying he walked past the young vandals who took care to give him all the room he wanted and disappeared in the thicket which covered the other side of the hill The two boys did not move or speak until they were certain that he had really gone and then one of them hurried to the fallen log snatched up the bundle that was lying behind it and ran off in a direction lying at right angles with the one Oscar had taken his companion following close behind him The bundle which seemed to be about as heavy as the boy could conveniently manage was made up of quail grouse and hares rightfully belonging to Leon If Oscar had not been in such haste to reach home and prepare his black fox for mounting if he had taken a little time to look into things as he afterward wished he had done a certain incident we have already recorded never would have happened CHAPTER XV BUGLE SEEKS REVENGE When the grouse and hares he had shot that day had been prepared for market and placed in the hands of the express agent Oscar ate his supper started a fire in his shop and set to work to skin the black fox and prepare it for mounting He intended that it should be his first contribution to the Yarmouth museum and he was anxious to make it the finest piece of work he had ever put up It was long after eleven o clock when he went to bed but at daylight he was in the woods with Bugle and by nine o clock three grouse and twelve out of a flock of fifteen quails he flushed just before reaching Mr Parker s hill farm had found their way into his game bag During his excursion of the previous day Oscar had found that birds were unusually abundant in Mr Bacon s neighborhood and he was slowly working his way in that direction when Bugle suddenly jumped a hare from a laurel thicket close in front of him Oscar who was thinking busily about something else was caught napping that time and before he could bring his gun to his shoulder the game had disappeared By running in a zig zag manner and making long leaps from side to side he succeeded in dodging the hound in the thick bushes But Bugle very soon found out what his tactics were and set to work to follow him up in a methodical and scientific way Knowing that a hare always runs in circles at the beginning of his flight Oscar sprang upon a fallen log that lay close at hand and waited for Bugle to bring the game around to the point from which he started He had scarcely settled himself to his satisfaction when the report of a gun rang through the woods followed by a doleful yelp from Bugle Oscar stood motionless with astonishment His first thought was that somebody had shot at the hare and hit the hound instead But a moment s reflection showed him that such an accident could not possibly happen under the circumstances The game had a good start and the dog could not have overtaken him in so short a time Beyond a doubt the concealed hunter whoever he was had shot Bugle on purpose With an exclamation of anger Oscar sprang down from his log and ran through the woods in the direction from which the report sounded When he had gone about a hundred yards he saw Bugle coming to meet him The animal seemed to be greatly excited for he bayed loudly and now and then he would stop and shake his head violently or sit down and scratch his ears Discovering his master he ran up to him laid his chin in his outstretched hand at the same time whining piteously and calling attention to his injuries by rubbing his paw over his head I didn t suppose you had an enemy in the world old fellow said Oscar trembling all over with indignation I know who did it It was those two river boys who destroyed Leon s snares Now we ll have a settlement with them if we can find them Why Bugle you are more scared than hurt after all While he was speaking Oscar made a hurried examination of his favorite s wounds and to his great delight discovered that but two shot had struck him and they had passed through one of his huge ears without touching his body at all Leon had not done as good shooting that morning as he usually did No doubt he was in a great hurry to have it over with and became nervous when he thought of the consequences that might follow his rash act or else the hound moved a little out of range just an instant before he pulled the trigger At any rate the shot was not as effective as Leon meant it should be but the wounded member bled profusely and his master s indignation increased while he looked at it Having satisfied himself that the hound was not seriously injured Oscar shouldered his gun again and set out at the top of his speed to overtake the bushwhackers A few minutes run brought him to the thicket in which Leon s snares were placed and there he stopped dropped the butt of his gun to the ground and finally walked over and seated himself on the very log on which Leon and his cousin had been sitting a short time before He had different opinions now regarding the identity of the bushwhackers It was plain enough to him that the river boys had nothing to do with the shooting Here were Leon s snares which had been completely destroyed the day before all in order and ready to catch the first thing that came within their reach He knew very well that the boys he had seen there on the previous day had not come back and repaired the mischief they had done they would be the last ones to think of such a thing It followed then that Leon must have repaired the snares himself that very morning and beyond a doubt it was he who shot the hound Oscar s indignation gave way to a feeling of sadness We ll not look any further Bugle said he And the hound which had stretched itself out at his feet and seemed to have forgotten all about the trifling injuries he had received rapped the leaves with his tail when his master spoke I don t want to see that boy for I might say or do something spiteful I can t understand it at all for I am sure I never did anything to Leon that should cause him to take such a revenge on me It can t be that he has anything against you Bugle for you never troubled him or anybody else did you I can t understand either how Leon happens to be in the woods to day for I know his father never lets him stay away from school to go hunting Let s go down to the brook and take a bath Bugle Leon and his cousin had not eluded pursuit so effectually as they thought they had for Oscar could have overtaken and confronted them in less than thirty minutes after the shooting was done had he felt so inclined He heard the reports of the shot gun and rifle which brought down the squirrels that supplied the runaways with a portion of their dinner and that was the way he found out that Leon was not alone Oscar knew that the other boy could be none other than Frank Fuller but he never thought of him in connection with the shooting for he did not believe that Frank had courage enough to perform an act of that kind He knew further that he had only to follow up the stream on the banks of which he spent half an hour in washing the blood from the hound s head to find the two boys for he saw the smoke of their camp fire rising above the tops of the trees But for the sake of the father who had been so kind to him Oscar was perfectly willing to overlook this unkindly act on the part of the son He saw that Bugle had forgotten all about it and he would try to forget it too After the hound s head had been bathed a few times the animal seemed to be himself again and when his master led him back to the place where he had been shot he took up the trail of his own accord and followed it with all his usual energy and zeal Oscar went back to his log and had scarcely taken up his position upon it when the frightened hare broke cover and was neatly stopped Oscar continued to hunt through the woods in the direction of the hollow in which Mr Bacon lived but at one o clock he turned and retraced his steps with both nets of his game bag completely filled and as large a bunch of birds and hares as he wanted to carry slung over his shoulder The game was left at the depot in time to be placed upon the evening s train for Yarmouth and on his way home Oscar stopped at the post office where he found two letters waiting for him One was from Calkins Son enclosing a check to pay for the grouse and hares he had sent them the night before and the other to his joy proved to be from one of the committee who had charge of the money which was to be expended in founding the university museum The letter was short and to the point and there were no Latin or Greek words in it to bother him It contained an invitation for him to visit the city at as early a day as possible bringing with him some specimens of his skill as a taxidermist If he would drop the writer a line by return mail telling him on what day and at what hour he might be expected to arrive in Yarmouth some member of the committee would meet him at the depot with a carriage Then came the following postscript Professor Kendall desires me to ask if you think there is any way in which he can recover his gun which was lost when the president s boat was capsized It is an imported weapon costing over three hundred dollars and as it was a present from a very dear friend he cannot bear the thought of giving it up His college duties have prevented him from visiting Eaton in regard to the matter I wonder what Sam Hynes will have to say now thought Oscar as he put the letter into his pocket If he doesn t come around to night I must go over to see him He is as much interested in my success as I am and I must keep him posted Now what ought I to take with me besides that black fox and when shall I tell them to look for me Oscar kept his mind on these matters all the way home He could have started for the city the very next day if it had not been for the fact that the committee wished to see some of his specimens Those he decided to take with him must all be mounted over again and that was very particular work and could not be hurried The birds must all be perched in trees and the standards that supported the trees as well as the board on which the black fox was placed must be painted and covered with moss and leaves preserved in paraffine to make them resemble the ground in the forest After that neat boxes must be made in which to pack the specimens for transportation and when Oscar had thought it all over he decided that the work could not be done in less than a week He told his correspondent so in the letter he wrote to him as soon as he reached home and set the following Wednesday for the start He added a piece of information that must have delighted Professor Kendall He said that the gun had been recovered with but very little effort that it was safe in his Oscar s hands and that in order to save express charges he would take it with him when he went to Yarmouth if its owner would consent to wait so long for it When the letter had been dropped into the office Oscar went home again and resumed his work upon the black fox While the specimen was growing into shape under his skilful hands he was suddenly startled by a loud scream of terror which sounded from the street and was immediately followed by angry bays and growls from Bugle Oscar wondering what could be the matter ran out into the yard with all haste and was greatly amazed to see Sam Hynes standing in front of the gate holding fast with both hands to the loose thick skin on the back of the hound s neck The animal had reared himself upon his hind legs and was struggling desperately to reach Leon Parker and his cousin Frank Fuller who stood a little further down the sidewalk trembling with fear and begging Sam not to let go his hold upon the enraged brute They knew that the hound recognized them and was determined to take revenge on them for what they had done that morning Had they taken to their heels the animal would have become more determined than ever Their safest course was to stand still and trust to Sam s grip Oscar had never before seen his favorite in such a fury Strong as Sam was it was all he could do to hold him In half a dozen jumps Oscar reached the gate and seizing Bugle around the body under his forelegs he dragged him into the yard with Sam s assistance and closed the gate upon him Leon and his cousin felt perfectly safe now They came slowly up the sidewalk their pale faces showing that they had sustained something of a fright What makes your dog act so asked Leon in a trembling voice at the same time moving toward the outside of the walk as he saw Bugle s white teeth gleaming between the pickets Is he mad Mad repeated Oscar who stood on the inside of the fence to keep the hound from jumping over it I shouldn t wonder if he was Wouldn t you be mad if somebody should send a charge of bird shot at your head The two boys opened their eyes and tried to look surprised but they only succeeded in looking guilty You don t mean to say that somebody shot him do you exclaimed Leon Yes I do and you were not far away at the time either It s false every word of it cried Frank with well feigned indignation We haven t seen him before to day Look here Towny said Sam you can t take that back any too quick As he said this he placed his hand on the latch and opened the gate which Oscar promptly closed again holding fast to it with one hand while he restrained Bugle with the other He had two obstinate and determined ones to manage now I mean he is mistaken for we didn t do it said Frank who saw that it would be no trouble at all to get into business then and there That sounds better replied Sam Now you keep still Nobody was saying a word to you when you chipped in Frank said no more and neither did Leon They stood silent for a moment and then with a common impulse walked toward home Oscar was glad to see them go and so was Bugle who speedily became his own friendly self again but Sam stood with his hands on the gate watching them and wishing that he had not allowed Oscar to keep him in the yard so easily Come into the shop said Oscar I ve got something there that will put you in good humor again Now as we walk along tell me how this trouble was brought about Bugle started it said Sam When I opened the gate he came out to meet me I saw there was something the matter with his ear and while I was examining it he happened to look down the street and saw Leon and Frank coming In an instant he was the maddest dog I ever saw He stuck up the hair on his neck gave a growl and charged through the gate Of course I didn t know what the matter was for I had never seen him act so before but knowing that he intended to use the teeth he showed so plainly I made a grab at him as he went through the gate and by the merest chance caught one of his hind legs Did you hear Frank scream I had no idea that a hound was so heavy and strong added Sam looking at his hands You came just in time for he would have slipped away from me in a minute Hey Sam who was on the point of seating himself on the work bench had just caught sight of the black fox Having never seen an animal like it before he examined it with the greatest interest Oscar had a good budget of news for his friend for the two last days were big with events Taking them in order he described all the incidents connected with his hunt after the prize he was then engaged in mounting and gave the particulars of his encounter with the two boys who destroyed Leon s snares He told all about the shooting of the hound gave a list of the game he had sent away during the afternoon and finally handed out the letter he had received from the committee To say that Sam was delighted with the letter would but feebly express his feelings He could not say enough in praise of Oscar s good fortune although he talked about it until almost dark When he saw his friend making preparations to light the lamp over his work bench Sam said good night and started for home CHAPTER XVI GOOD AND BAD NEWS Oscar now gave up hunting entirely he did not neglect to drop a line to the commission merchants telling them why he was obliged to do so and they in reply sent him a cordial invitation to visit them when he came to Yarmouth and devoted himself to the preparation of his specimens He worked hard all day and studied late every night and the nine o clock train which passed through Eaton on Wednesday morning carried him away with the rest of its passengers his specimens which were carefully and neatly boxed being stowed away in the express car In his hands Oscar carried the gun which he and Sam had fished up from the bottom of the river and by it he was recognized when he reached Yarmouth depot There were two gentlemen there waiting for him and one of them was the owner of the recovered fowling piece The instant he saw it he knew that Oscar was the boy he and his companion were looking for Oscar was gone just a week and what he saw and did during his absence and what bargain he made with the committee we shall learn as soon as he meets his friend Sam who of course must know all about it We will tell the reader this much however for it would not sound well coming from Oscar s lips even if he knew all about it which he did not The young taxidermist was almost overwhelmed by his reception He was introduced to the faculty to the students and to many prominent citizens as the brave youth who had saved President Potter s life That eccentric gentleman had never thought it worth while to mention the name of Sam Hynes in connection with his rescue but the reader may rest assured that Oscar did not neglect to do it Whenever the subject was spoken of in his hearing the active and important part taken by the cool headed Sam was faithfully and graphically described This one act on Oscar s part the saving of the president s life was enough to make him a hero in the eyes of all the strangers who surrounded him but what added to the interest with which they regarded him was the fact that he had been selected to complete the university s collection of birds and animals The faculty and students as well as some of the citizens knew that Professor Potter had at last found somebody to do the work and when it was announced that that somebody would soon visit Yarmouth to exhibit specimens of his skill his arrival was awaited with no little impatience The professor had not been at all particular about describing the person he had engaged and the students expected to find themselves confronted by a bearded fine looking man in buckskin or else in high top boots red shirt and slouch hat standing at least six feet high with broad shoulders and so powerful a grip that nobody would dare shake hands with him These being their ideas how great must have been their astonishment when there appeared among them one morning a neatly dressed modest youth who seemed to shrink away from them and who blushed every time anyone spoke to him They could scarcely believe their eyes but the committee took him and Oscar s position was established at once On the second day after his arrival he was invited to dine at the house of a prominent citizen and there he met a brilliant company including the gentleman who had given the money to found the museum The men treated him with a respect that astonished him and the ladies crowded around him and asked questions until Oscar wished most heartily that he could crawl into a hollow log somewhere and get out of sight Through all this trying ordeal the young taxidermist conducted himself with the utmost propriety but when the week was ended and he found himself on board the train bound for Eaton he drew a long breath of relief and said to himself Thank goodness it is all over Sam Hynes was at the depot when Oscar reached the village on Wednesday night and eager as he was to hear what his friend had to tell him he was still more eager to communicate to him a piece of news that was just then the talk of the town Oscar lingered for a few minutes on the platform to exchange greetings with two or three friends who chanced to be there but he drew away from them as soon as he could and started for home accompanied by Sam He was very anxious to see his mother Well said Oscar as they locked arms and walked briskly toward the village I don t see that Eaton has changed any during my absence Oh you don t exclaimed Sam One would think you had been somewhere to hear you talk I have been somewhere and in less than a week I am going somewhere else Have you any news for me I have and I know you will be sorry to hear it not on account of the young rascals themselves but on Mr Parker s account Leon and his cousin Frank Fuller have run away from home Oscar withdrew his arm and stopped and looked at his friend who backed off and put his hands in his pockets The two gazed into each other s faces for a few seconds and then locked arms and walked on again I hope there is some mistake about it said Oscar as soon as he could speak I wish there was from the bottom of my heart replied Sam earnestly Oscar was silent for several minutes He recalled all the favors for which he was indebted to the kind hearted lawyer thought of the numerous indulgences which he knew Mr Parker had granted his scapegrace son and then broke out fiercely Leon deserves to be thrashed within an inch of his life He is a mean boy who will run away from such a father as he has Just what I have remarked a score of times answered Sam But Mr Chamberlain says that the punishment he will receive before he gets through with this business will be worse than thrashing They packed up and cleared out on the very night that you went to Yarmouth Go on and tell me all about it said Oscar I don t know much to tell answered Sam for of course Mr Parker and his family have had very little to say about the matter The amount of it is that Leon has been in trouble ever since his cousin came here Frank led him into all sorts of scrapes and finally induced him to run away from school a thing Leon had never done before in his life On the same day Mr Fuller arrived from Boston to see how Frank was getting on with his studies and the first thing he learned in regard to him was that he had been playing truant The general impression seems to be that the young men were disciplined and that they got angry about it Where have they gone and what do they intend to do Nobody seems to know They took a good supply of clothing with them and also their guns Ah No doubt they intend to sell their guns in order to obtain money to pay their way observed Oscar There s no need of that answered Sam I don t know whether or not Frank had any money but Leon had a pocketful of it His grandfather of late years has made it a point to give Leon a hundred dollars every Christmas Unfortunately the money was deposited in the bank to Leon s credit and all he had to do was to present his book and draw the funds My gracious exclaimed Oscar what a scamp that boy must be He wouldn t be so bad if it wasn t for Frank He is the one who has led Leon into all this trouble Now let me ask you a few questions What luck have you had Your last letter made me believe that you had some good news for me And so I have replied Oscar I have had the best of luck and if nothing unforeseen happens I shall be on my way to the plains by a week from to night You don t tell me so cried Sam whose astonishment and delight were almost unbounded How was it all brought about I can hardly tell you for the truth is I have lived in such a state of excitement and bewilderment ever since I have been away that I hardly knew whether I stood on my head or my heels In the first place I was completely upset by the attentions that were shown me when I arrived in Yarmouth The officers of the college and this museum committee took me in charge at once They wouldn t let me go to a hotel as I wanted to do but President Potter he is not a crazy man Sam took me to his home and kept me there The next day I was shown over the university and all the students looked at me as if I had been some rare specimen of taxidermy I went into their museum and I tell you what s a fact Sam my specimens beat theirs all to pieces I am glad to hear it said Sam My specimens are there now continued Oscar and anybody can see for himself which is the best work It would have made you laugh to see those students crowd around me and ask me questions in natural history just as though I knew all about it The committee wanted me to put up some new specimens for them so I went down to the store of Calkins Son and picked out four nice ones a hare grouse mallard and black squirrel I told them who I was and what I wanted the birds and animals for and they wouldn t take a cent for them When I found that I was expected to put up these specimens in the presence of a class as well as the committee and explain every operation my hand trembled so that I could hardly hold the knife and I couldn t say a word You were embarrassed said Sam You had never received so much attention before And I hope I never will again said Oscar honestly Ah exclaimed Sam with a knowing shake of his head wait until you come back from the plains If you are successful they will make a lion of you What sort of work did you do before the class Oh after I got fairly started and gained a little confidence I was all right My tongue ran glibly enough and I never did quicker or better work in my life When I got through I had four as fine specimens as you ever saw Good exclaimed Sam Well what was the next thing The next thing was the best part of the whole business answered Oscar It was a private conference with the committee during which I was engaged for one year with the understanding that if they were satisfied with my work I was to keep right on until I had furnished the museum with specimens from every country on the globe Just think of that Whew whistled Sam In the first place as I told you I am to go out West My instructions are to confine myself entirely to large game although I am at liberty to secure any rare bird or animal that may chance to come in my way But I mustn t waste my time in hunting for them What they want most is a specimen of the Felis concolor and also Hallo exclaimed Sam What s the matter with you asked Oscar Nothing replied his companion I forgot that you had been through college Big words come easy to you since your association with those learned men don t they Well good night The boys had by this time reached Oscar s gate Bugle hearing the sound of his master s voice came over the fence without touching it and was so demonstrative in his greeting that Oscar was obliged to seize him by the neck and hold him off Oscar wanted Sam to go in but the latter declined He knew that his friend would want to talk to his mother about his good fortune and he wisely concluded that the presence of a third party might not be agreeable He would see Oscar the next day after school he said and listen to the rest of the narrative So Sam went home and Oscar went into the house He told his mother the same story he had told his companion adding an item of information that astonished her not a little CHAPTER XVII PAYING THE FIDDLER Let us now return to Leon and Frank whom we left at the close of the second chapter hastening over the hills toward home after spending the day in the woods They had by no means enjoyed themselves as well as they expected they should and now when it was too late they would have given almost anything if they could have lived the day over again They would have gone to school Like all guilty persons they were afraid and Leon did not attempt to conceal the fact although Frank did They ran almost all the way to the village and climbing the fence at the back of Mr Parker s lot they hurried across the field taking care to keep the barn between themselves and the house The merry shouts that came to their ears told them that they had not a moment to lose that school had just been dismissed They entered the barn through the back door and after hiding their guns and equipments in the hay mow ran out again They crept along on their hands and knees under cover of the currant bushes crossed two or three lots and finally reached the street in which the school house was located Then they breathed easier They slackened their pace and walked along like honest school boys believing that all danger of discovery was passed but what was their astonishment and alarm when one of their schoolmates who had seen them climb the fence hurried up to them exclaiming as soon as he came within speaking distance Hallo fellows where have you been to day We have been at home replied Frank who having a larger stock of falsehoods at his command than his cousin was always expected to speak for him We couldn t come to school to day That s very strange replied the boy Miles Jackson went to your house this morning to ask where you were and returned with the report that you had started for school as usual Leon was almost ready to drop and Frank as soon as he had somewhat recovered from his amazement asked angrily What business had Miles Jackson to make inquiries about us I d like to know The professor sent him replied the boy You see there was a new rule went into operation this morning Mr Chamberlain says he ll not be responsible for our advancement unless we come to school regularly and hereafter when any of the pupils are absent he s going to send somebody to their homes to find out what s the matter The boy hurried on to overtake some fellows he saw in advance of him leaving Frank and Leon standing on the sidewalk and looking at each other in speechless amazement It s all up with us groaned Leon as soon as he had recovered the use of his tongue We have danced and now we must pay the fiddler What a little snipe that Miles Jackson is exclaimed Frank in great disgust Why couldn t he tell the professor that we were kept at home Oh he isn t that sort replied Leon You needn t expect him to help you out of any scrape you get into No you can t expect such a favor from any fellow in this town snapped Frank It takes city boys to do that They stick to one another through thick and thin and any spoony who tries to win the favor of the teacher by carrying tales is cut dead as soon as he is found out There s another fellow who is mean enough for anything Don t talk so loud whispered Leon hastily You can get into trouble with him in a minute I don t care replied Frank in a still louder tone I haven t seen a boy yet in this town that I am afraid of The subject of this conversation was Sam Hynes who was striding along about twenty yards in front of them in his usual free and easy manner his hands in his pockets and his cap on the back of his head He must have been very much engrossed with his own thoughts or else he would certainly have heard what Frank said Arriving at the gate that led into Mrs Preston s yard he jerked it open Sam handled everything as if it were made of iron and to the intense amazement of Leon and his cousin was greeted by Oscar s hound The moment the gate was opened the huge animal raised himself on his hind legs and placed his forefeet upon Sam s shoulders Well I declare exclaimed Leon I thought as much replied his cousin There s that dog as gay and frisky as he was this morning when he was following that trail A pretty shot you made didn t you I know I hit him somewhere said Leon Let s have a look at him and see if I didn t It s strange how much everybody thinks of that hound He s got more friends in town than I have The cousins saw Sam pat the animal on the head then gently push him off and bend over to examine his ear Just then Bugle happened to look around the gate post and saw Frank and Leon approaching With an angry growl he dashed forward throwing Sam flatter than he had ever been thrown by any boy of his age and in a moment more something disagreeable and even tragic might have happened had it not been for Sam s wonderful agility He did not know what was the matter but he saw that the hound had made up his mind to bite somebody and he was resolved to prevent it if he could As Bugle passed him Sam caught him by one of his hind legs and scrambling quickly to his feet drew the dog toward him until he could seize him by the back of the neck But Frank thought the animal was coming and uttered a scream that could have been heard two blocks away Then Oscar appeared on the scene and after that came the colloquy we have already recorded during which two facts were brought to light One was that Oscar knew right where to look to find the person who had shot his favorite and the other that there was at least one boy in Eaton of whom the boastful Frank was afraid When Leon and his cousin resumed their walk toward home their faces were very pale but they soon recovered from their fright and then as a natural consequence they began to get angry They had got themselves deeply in trouble that day but instead of being sorry for it and making an honest resolve that they would do better in future they became enraged at their luck which had not served them a better turn Having no one else upon whom to vent their spite they began abusing each other If it hadn t been for Sam Hynes that dog would have made bad work with us exclaimed Frank You came very near getting us into a pretty scrape by your miserable marksmanship I wouldn t brag any more about my skill with a shot gun if I were in your place That s a nice way for you to talk isn t it retorted Leon Do I brag any more than you do You said there wasn t a boy in town you were afraid of and yet when you saw that Sam Hynes was going to open that gate you were in such a hurry to take back your words that you couldn t talk plainly The cousins being in a very bad humor continued to exchange such compliments as these until they arrived in sight of Mr Parker s house Then they became silent for they had other matters to think of What was going to happen when they got on the inside of that house They would have been glad if they could have found an excuse for postponing their entrance indefinitely but knowing that they must face the consequences of their folly sooner or later they opened the gate without hesitation mounted the steps and entered the sitting room To the no small astonishment of both boys the first person upon whom their eyes rested was Mr Fuller Frank s father He had come down from Boston to see how his son was getting on and hoping to hear a good report of him He also had some news to communicate that twenty four hours before would have made the boys dance with delight He had decided to start for California on a business tour in about three weeks he was going to take Frank with him and he had asked Mr Parker to allow Leon to accompany them The subject was broached that morning when Mr Fuller first arrived and Frank and Leon s prospects for making an extended pleasure trip looked very bright indeed but during the discussion Miles Jackson acting under instructions from Mr Chamberlain suddenly made his appearance and wanted to know why the boys were not at school The runaway business dashed all their prospects to the ground and that was only the beginning of their trouble Another occupant of the room whom the boys did not expect to see was Mr Parker who was generally at his office this hour of the day As the truants came in he arose and moved toward the library beckoning to Leon to follow him He closed the door behind him Mrs Parker left the room and Frank found himself alone with his father Well young man said Mr Fuller where have you been to day The boy did not know what to say He was in a scrape that he could not lie out of Where have you been to day repeated Mr Fuller sternly The look and the tone in which these words were uttered loosened Frank s tongue very quickly I have been in the woods sir said he Been in the woods repeated his father Ran away from school Sneaked out of the house like a thief Is this what I sent you to Eaton for No sir but I don t like this school and I don t want to stay here I want to go home You ll not go home You will stay right here and go to school every day and if I ever hear of your playing truant again there will be a settlement between us that you will remember Now young man I will tell you for your satisfaction that you have destroyed all your chances of going to California with me Don t expect any privileges until you have learned to behave yourself Mr Fuller settled back on the sofa and turned his attention to the paper he held in his hand while Frank after sitting uneasily on the edge of his chair for a few minutes and twirling his cap on his finger arose and left the room Presently the door of the library opened and Leon came out with red and swollen eyes and started for the barn When he returned he brought with him his cousin s rifle and his own double barrel which had been hidden in the haymow The double barrel and its equipments he carried into the library and saw them placed in one of the long drawers of the bookcase and locked up The rifle he carried to his own room where he found his cousin pacing back and forth flourishing his fists in the air and talking to himself He was in a state of almost ungovernable fury When Leon came in he stopped and looked at him What did your father say to you he asked and where is your gun My gun is under lock and key and I can t have it again this winter whined Leon Father says that if I am going to be a vagabond and spend my time in the woods I shall not have a gun to help me enjoy myself You got us both into a nice mess this morning didn t you Now don t go back on me in that fashion exclaimed Frank We are in a bad fix and we must stick together in order to get out of it These words seemed to make an impression upon Leon The angry scowl faded from his face and the next words he addressed to his cousin were spoken in a more friendly tone What did Uncle William say to you he inquired He said only one thing I can remember replied Frank and that is that I have lost all my chances of going out West That s just what my father said to me returned Leon It seems that Uncle William came here on purpose to make arrangements for taking us with him on his trip to California but by this day s work we have knocked everything on the head We ll see about that said Frank in a savage tone I wish you had been in Guinea before you proposed running away from school this morning continued Leon growing angry again and slamming his cousin s rifle down upon the bed You were ready enough to join in with me retorted Frank But go back on me if you feel like it I can take care of myself I am going to straighten things out in a hurry What do you intend to do I intend to clear out and I shall not be long about it either Father says I must stay here and go to school every day but I ll show him whether I will or not I wouldn t be afraid to bet him the twenty dollars I ve got in my trunk that I ll see that western country before he does Leon sat down on the bed and looked at his cousin without speaking CHAPTER XVIII LEON MAKES UP HIS MIND Your father couldn t have come here at a worse time could he said Leon at length He was disappointed rather than angry His uncle had formed some very elaborate plans for his enjoyment and also Frank s and they had knocked them all on the head by running away from school It was Mr Fuller s intention to cross the plains on horseback the Pacific Railroad was not in existence at the time these incidents happened and return by steamer The boys would have been delighted by a trip like this and they might have gone had it not been for their one act of folly Frank showed a disposition to smash things when he thought about it but Leon felt more like crying His coming here made no difference He would have found out all about it sooner or later for your father would have written him full particulars But I don t care said Frank who continued to stride up and down the room shaking his fists in the air I am going to clear out and if you have any pluck at all you will do the same Leon placed his elbows on his knees fastened his eyes upon the floor and made no immediate reply He had talked very glibly about leaving his comfortable home and going out into the world to make himself famous as a hunter and Indian fighter but in dreaming about it he had always skipped the preliminaries How he was going to leave home and make his way to that pleasant valley in the mountains in which he intended to build his cabin he did not know nor did he care to trouble himself about it Some boys as we know make great calculations and have much to say about the fame they expect to win when they are established in some business or profession and have plenty of money at their disposal but they make no note of the long hours that must be spent in study and hard work before they can attain to the desired eminence So with Leon He sometimes spent half the night going through imaginary fights with grizzly bears Indians and outlaws and picturing to himself the delight that would be his when he was fairly settled in his mountain home but he did not like to dwell upon the thought that before all this could be accomplished he must sneak away from his father s house like a thief in the night and make a long journey by rail and steam boat before he would be anywhere within reach of his hunting grounds But now these matters were brought squarely home to him and it was high time he was bestowing some thought upon them You don t seem to be very enthusiastic said Frank suddenly pausing in his walk and looking sharply at his cousin No longer ago than this morning you talked as though you were crazy to get away from home and become your own master I wish I could see that western country before I go there to live said Leon I don t know anything about it Well how are you going to find out anything about it until you go there asked Frank And how are you going to get there unless you pack up and start off on your own hook My father will not take you or me either How much money have you got in the bank Six hundred dollars replied Leon Whew whistled Frank opening his eyes in great amazement That will take us to Independence with flying colors After we get there we ll buy a couple of saddle horses and a pack mule and then we ll be all right we ll not ask favors of anybody But how will we know which way to go asked Leon Oh we ll look for a wagon train that s the way the most of the emigrants do If we can t find one we ll start off by ourselves We can t get lost for the trails are as plain as the road in front of the house But the Indians might find us suggested Leon What s the matter with you anyhow demanded Frank sharply If you don t want to go say so at once and I ll start off by myself The Indians won t bother us until we get where they are will they There are none along these trails of which I speak Why as early as travelling there was perfectly safe Have you never heard of the two thousand Mormons who walked and pushed hand carts all the way from Iowa City to Salt Lake They were often attacked by wolves we shouldn t mind the wolves you know a few fights with them would relieve the monotony of our journey but the history of that expedition doesn t say that they ever saw an Indian When Leon heard this he straightened up and began to take some interest in what his cousin was saying but it is probable that his interest would have died away again very speedily if he had been told something of the history of those hand cart expeditions It is thirteen hundred miles from Iowa City to Salt Lake Valley and it requires fifteen weeks of constant travelling to accomplish the distance Of the first division of five hundred Mormons who left Iowa City in July to trundle their hand carts to Salt Lake one hundred and twenty perished miserably before reaching their destination Their cattle starved or died from overwork their provisions gave out winter overtook them while they were still five hundred miles from the valley and it was no uncommon thing for them to wake up in the morning and find from three to fifteen of their number cold in death Of the second company of six hundred which left the Missouri in August only four hundred and fifty reached the valley and out of the whole number two thousand three hundred were starved frozen or devoured by wolves and two hundred were maimed for life Frank knew all this for he had read a full account of it but it did not daunt him for he believed that in some mysterious way he would be able to escape the perils that fell to the lot of other travellers on the plains I ll not say a word to Leon about the dangers they encountered soliloquized Frank for if I do it will take all the pluck out of him He hasn t even courage enough to run away from a tyrant of a father I can see that plainly enough but as I am determined to go myself and he has money while I have none to speak of I must get him interested in the matter Now how am I going to do it That s the question Frank relapsing into silence placed his hands behind his back and resumed his walk up and down the room turning the question over in his mind If he had only known it there was no need that he should trouble himself about the matter for that very night an incident happened that turned the scale in his favor While he was wondering what he could say that would induce his cousin to fall in with his wild scheme the supper bell rang The truants would have been glad of an excuse for disregarding the summons but knowing that if they did not answer it immediately somebody would come upstairs to see about it they made a hasty toilet and descended to the dining room To their great relief nothing was said or done to indicate that anything had gone wrong that day Their fathers had had a settlement with them and that was the end of the matter They were treated with as much consideration as they usually were but Frank grew angry again when his father talked about the mines in which he was interested and described the wonders which he expected to see during his absence Frank finished his supper as soon as he could and then gave his cousin a wink which the latter understood As they asked to be excused and arose from the table Mr Parker turned from his brother in law with whom he was conversing and said to his son Leon don t go away to night No sir replied the boy Do you know what that means he added angrily when he and his cousin were safe in their room again It means that my liberty is stopped that I can t even go outside of the gate any more until father says the word Well you re a fool if you stand it replied Frank Make up your mind to go with me and then you can do as you please My mind is made up exclaimed Leon with a sudden burst of fury If my gun wasn t locked up I d start to night and if I once get away I ll never set my foot in Eaton again That gun is just what troubles me replied Frank We can t get it until my father goes away because he or some of the family are always in the sitting room Does one key unlock every drawer in that bookcase Leon replied that it did Then we needn t worry I have often seen the key left in the doors of the bookcase and when we get ready to start we ll have that gun out of there All we ve got to do is to watch our chance and slip into the library some night when the sitting room is empty Where is your bank book In mother s bureau Have you got pluck enough to steal it out of there Yes I have answered Leon with more spirit than his cousin had ever seen him exhibit before Well after you get it will you go to the bank and draw your money Yes I will I m not going to be deprived of all privileges and shut up as if I were a felon That s the way to talk said Frank giving his cousin an approving slap on the back I was mistaken in you You have some courage after all Frank was satisfied now If he could only keep his cousin in an angry mood he was sure of money enough to defray his expenses to the plains It was not so very difficult to do this for events seemed to conspire to assist them CHAPTER XIX PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS The discussion thus commenced was kept up until midnight and Leon gladdened the heart of his cousin by repeatedly declaring that he had determined upon his course and that nothing could induce him to change his mind They did not go out of their room again that night They sat at the window and talked about the glorious times they expected to have when they reached the plains and when Mr Parker and Mr Fuller went out of the gate and started for the village Frank took occasion to comment upon it They are free to go and come as they please said he with no little show of temper and here we are shut up like a couple of thieves You are not shut up said Leon Your father didn t tell you to stay in Do you suppose that I am going to enjoy myself unless you can go too asked Frank who seemed to have grown very disinterested all of a sudden No sir We got into this trouble together and we ll stick to each other until we are safely out of it I ve just thought of something said Leon suddenly How are we going to get an excuse to morrow You can t write one for the professor has found out through that little snipe Miles Jackson that we ran away We ll not say a word about it replied his cousin If your father feels like giving us an excuse all right if he doesn t we ll go without one Frank spoke as though he had no interest in the matter but it troubled him not a little It troubled Leon too and it was not settled until the next morning when Mr Parker said to Leon as the latter arose from the breakfast table I think it would be a good plan for you to look over the lessons you missed yesterday I will call at ten minutes of nine and walk down to the school house with you Yes no doubt I ll look over those lessons said Leon when he and his cousin had closed the door of the room behind them I ll see all the school books in the country in Guinea before I will touch one until I am obliged to do so But Leon was handling his school books even while he spoke He and Frank had each two sets one at school and another which they kept at home and which they were supposed to study occasionally of evenings The first thing the two boys did was to scatter their books all over the table so that if Mr Parker should happen to come into the room he would be led to believe that they had been studying and then they sat down and talked about the subject that was uppermost in their minds At the appointed time Mr Parker came to the foot of the stairs and called to them to come down He walked with them to the school house and leaving them in the yard entered the building and sought an interview with Mr Chamberlain What passed between the two gentlemen the truants never knew There was nothing said to them about running away from school and they very soon became satisfied that their previous day s work would bring them into no trouble with their teacher But they got into trouble with somebody else before four o clock came It happened on the ball ground during the afternoon recess Leon was having a good deal to say regarding Oscar Preston s dishonesty and Mr Smith s refusal to give him a letter of recommendation and Frank was helping him by putting in a word occasionally when Sam Hynes and his base ball bat suddenly appeared on the scene Leon s speech was brought to a sudden close for he was doubled up like a jack knife by a punch in the ribs from the bat and Frank escaped similar treatment by taking to his heels The consequence was that the names of Sam Hynes and Leon Parker appeared among those of other delinquents who were requested to keep their seats when the rest of the students were dismissed At the end of half an hour a settlement had been had with all the law breakers except Sam and Leon The principal looked at them a moment and said solemnly Boys I am sorry to hear that you have been fighting Mr Chamberlain said Sam I did all the fighting that was done Leon never lifted a hand The professor looked down at the paper cutter he held in his hand and finally said Parker you may go Good for me said Leon to himself as he hurried down the stairs I am well out of that scrape I hope you ll get a good licking Mr Sam Hynes that s all the harm I wish you If Leon had been standing in front of the school house about ten minutes later he would have been disappointed and perhaps greatly disgusted A step sounded in the hall and Sam Hynes came bounding out as if he were set on springs When he reached the steps he thrust his hands into his pockets struck up a lively whistle and walked off with an air which seemed to say that he was well satisfied with the world and everybody in it himself included It was evident from his actions that he had not been very severely reprimanded for the part he had taken in the affair on the ball ground but Leon could not say as much for himself half an hour after he arrived at his father s house Frank had been loitering along the road waiting for Leon and when the two reached home they found all the family there as before Leon was at once invited into the library while Frank who did not care to stay where his father was went up to his room He wondered what was wrong now and when his cousin came up he found out Leon s face was very pale his eyes were red and swollen and Frank had never seen him so angry before Father knows all about that fuss we had at school to day said he as soon as he entered the room He heard some of the students talking about it at the post office It beats me how many fellows there are in the world who can t be easy until they tell all they know Well what of it inquired Frank shortly What of it repeated Leon Father gave me the worst going over I ever had in my life He praised Oscar up to the skies and told me in so many words that I would do well to take him for a model The idea exclaimed Frank A market shooter He is a pretty model for any decent boy It has always been so said Leon bitterly Father sees something good in everybody except me and if I am so awful bad he won t feel sorry when I get out of his sight After this Leon seemed to throw all his fears and scruples to the winds He had got it into his head that he was a badly abused boy that he would be in trouble as long as he remained in Eaton and he was impatient to get out into the world where he could do as he pleased without any fear of being taken to task for his misdeeds Mr Fuller remained in Eaton for nearly two weeks and Frank who did not think it safe to attempt to carry out his plans until his father was well on his way toward home fumed and fretted all the day During that time the two discontented boys went to school regularly it was dangerous to play truant now that that new rule had gone into operation and if they learned nothing else they did learn these four things That Oscar Preston s reputation had been cleared that Mr Smith had apologized and offered to make all the amends in his power that Oscar and Sam Hynes had made heroes of themselves by saving a man from drowning and that the man was rich and was going to do something for Oscar They were not however acquainted with the fact that the rescued man had already done something for the young taxidermist in that he had offered him a hundred dollars a month and expenses to procure specimens for the university museum In fact there were very few people in the village who knew that for Oscar had spoken of it only to those whom he was sure he could trust with the secret There was an interview yet to come with the members of the committee and Oscar thought it would be time enough to speak of the professor s offer after the result of that interview was known Tuesday morning came at last and Mr Fuller after taking leave of his son and giving him some good advice to which it is hardly necessary to say Frank paid no sort of attention stepped into Mr Parker s carriage and was driven to the depot Frank stood on the porch with his aunt and cousin watching the carriage as long as it remained in sight He had assumed a very sober face for the occasion and seemed to be much dejected When the carriage disappeared he went slowly up the stairs to his room and Leon followed him The moment the latter closed the door Frank s countenance changed as if by magic Now then said he briskly the time for action has come Go down and steal that bank book and be quick about it for it is almost school time I am almost afraid to do it answered Leon Mother may have occasion to go to that bureau drawer some time during the day and what would become of us if she should miss the book and make inquiries about it The risk is too great Whenever I steal that book we must draw the money and get out of town without an hour s delay Now how in the world are we going to do that questioned Frank impatiently We can t walk out of town with our guns and carpet bags in broad daylight You must get that book now take it to school with you and run down to the bank at noon and draw the money When we come home we ll think up some way to get your gun and as soon as it grows dark we ll slip out and start for Franklin where we will board the first western bound train If we get on the cars at this station we will run the risk of being seen by a dozen people who will recognize us We can t help taking some chances and if you are afraid to do it you can stay here and welcome I am off to night Frank talked rapidly for time was precious When he ceased speaking Leon opened the door with an air of dogged resolution and went downstairs CHAPTER XX LEON DRAWS HIS MONEY Frank was by no means so much at his ease as he appeared to be He knew as well as Leon did that they were playing an extremely hazardous game and the fear that their plans might be defeated made him so nervous that he could not keep still to save his life He paced restlessly up and down the room awaiting his cousin s return with no little impatience Leon was gone a long time so long that Frank began to be alarmed He was on the point of going in search of him when he heard his step on the stairs A moment thereafter the door opened and Leon came in His face was as white as a sheet and his hands trembled as though he had been seized with an attack of the ague Well said Frank I ve got it replied Leon in a scarcely audible whisper and I came near being caught in the act too I had to wait until mother went into the kitchen then I slipped into the bedroom and had just taken the book out of the drawer when I heard her coming back I tell you I thought I should drop when she asked me what I was doing in there and what made my face so pale Whew added Leon drawing his hand across his forehead It was a close call I don t know how I shall manage to get that gun Don t worry over it answered Frank who knew that everything depended upon keeping up his cousin s courage We can think about it when the time comes to secure the gun If I see a chance I ll get it for you myself The two boys were now anxious to leave the house with the least possible delay They seemed to think that as long as they remained there they were in danger of being found out They hurried off to school as soon as they could find their caps and during the whole of that forenoon lived in a state of excitement and fear that can hardly be described Leon s bank book felt as heavy as lead in his pocket Of course he felt guilty and it seemed to him that the students sitting in his immediate vicinity stared at him a good deal and with an expression on their faces which seemed to say that they knew all about it More than once Leon was on the point of backing squarely out and writing a note on his slate to his cousin telling him he would not go but every time he resolved upon this a neat little cabin in the mountains with its luxurious beds of buffalo robes joints of venison and bear meat hanging from the rafters and a couple of fleet Indian ponies feeding in the glade close by would rise before his mental vision and Leon would tell himself that it was worth while to run some risk if by so doing he could live in that way Then there was his unhappy home Leon did not consider that it was made so by his own acts the gloomy school room the law against going outside the gate the prohibition that had been laid upon his hunting for the rest of the season all these things came into his mind and Leon would shut his teeth hard and resolve again that he would carry out his plans no matter what happened As the hour of twelve drew near Leon became as nervous and frightened as he was when he stole the bank book in the morning The money must be drawn from the bank and it must be drawn too before one o clock or not at all that day It would be dangerous to postpone this important matter for his parents might discover that the book was gone from the drawer and that would lead to an investigation The sooner their plans were carried into execution and they were safe out of town the better it would be for them When school was dismissed the two boys hurried down the street keeping a good lookout on every side for Leon s father The lawyer s office was over the bank and they did not want to go in there after the money until they had satisfied themselves that he had gone home to his dinner Mr Parker had a good deal of business to do with the bank and what if he should happen to drop in just as the cashier was handing out Leon s six hundred dollars The bare thought was enough to frighten them and they were very cautious in their movements They did not see Mr Parker s carriage when they reached Main Street but they thought it best to reconnoitre before entering the bank so they kept on down the street and when they passed the stairs leading to Mr Parker s office they glanced into the hall and saw him standing there conversing with a couple of gentlemen That knocks us whispered Leon We must give it up for to day No sir answered Frank emphatically You ll never make your way in the world if you are going to give up as easy as that Let s go where we can keep an eye on him He ll go to his dinner pretty soon As Frank spoke he led the way across the street and into Smith Anderson s store One of the clerks came up to serve them but Frank said they didn t want anything Of course your father saw us come in here said he in a whisper to Leon and if he follows us to see what we are about we ll buy some crackers and cheese for a lunch But Mr Parker did not follow them The boys had scarcely taken up their positions in front of the window when he came out of the hall and went into the bank If Leon and his cousin had not exercised so much caution he would certainly have caught them there At the end of ten minutes he came out and walked briskly across the park toward home As soon as he had disappeared the boys opened the door and went out They hurried across to the bank and Leon with a trembling hand placed his book upon the glass shelf in front of the cashier s desk How much do you want to day Leon asked that officer I want all of it sir was the reply All of it repeated the cashier The words were uttered in a tone of surprise and Leon almost expected that the man would tell him he could not pay out so large a sum of money until he knew what it was to be used for but he did nothing of the kind He knew that the boy had been allowed by his indulgent father to manage his bank account to suit himself and he had no comments to make He consulted a huge ledger that lay on one of the desks made some figures with a pencil in Leon s book and then he came back and began counting out the money While he was thus engaged the boys paced back and forth in front of the desk and cast frequent and anxious glances toward the door fearing that somebody might come in But luck was on their side and their fears were not realized The cashier was a long time in counting out the money but finally he completed his task and handed out to Leon a pile of bills that made him and Frank open their eyes in the greatest amazement It was so large that when Leon rolled it up he could hardly get it into his pocket My gracious he exclaimed as he and Frank hurried out and bent their steps toward the school house I had no idea that I owned so much cash Six hundred dollars is a nice little amount of money answered Frank and you must have a tidy sum there for interest I tell you Leon that will set us up in good shape It will buy us a splendid outfit and keep us in provisions until we can capture furs enough to get more We have taken two dangerous steps and there are only two left What are they asked Leon Stealing your gun out of that bookcase is one and leaving the house with our baggage is the other If we can take those two steps without being caught we can breathe easy for we shall have nothing but plain sailing before us It turned out that Frank was anything but a good prophet Circumstances rendered it comparatively easy for them to secure the gun and leave the house but they did not afterward have plain sailing It was but a short time after that that the trouble began CHAPTER XXI THE RUNAWAYS During the afternoon Leon was so nervous and uneasy that he could scarcely keep his seat There were two ways now in which he could be detected His mother might go to the bureau drawer and find that the bank book was missing or the cashier might casually ask Mr Parker if the latter had occasion to enter the bank if his son had an idea of going into business A question like that would of course excite the lawyer s curiosity and might lead to inquiries on his part that would bring the whole plot to light It was only by neglecting his books entirely and dwelling upon the joys of a hunter s life that Leon could keep up his courage He failed completely in every one of his recitations and his teacher losing all patience at last informed him that if those lessons were not fully mastered by the next time he came into the class room he would have the privilege of studying them after school Not much I won t study those lessons after school said Leon to himself as he returned to his seat I have been kept as a delinquent for the last time I hope that after to day I shall never see a school book When the cousins started for home that night the fears that had haunted them all the day long increased tenfold Leon did not want to face his father and mother after what he had done and he took good care to keep out of their way until supper time It was a wonder that Mr and Mrs Parker did not suspect the boys of some wrong doing for their agitation when they came downstairs in response to the call of the bell was almost too palpable to escape notice They arose from the table after making a very light supper and started for their room That was the last time Leon expected to see his father and mother that night and perhaps forever and he was already telling himself that all danger of discovery was past when his father suddenly called to him The boy s heart almost came up into his mouth as he turned about and went back into the dining room Why Leon exclaimed Mr Parker now for the first time noticing the boy s pale face and trembling hands what is the matter with you Are you ill No sir stammered Leon I am not sick but I haven t felt like myself to day And that is the honest truth he added mentally I have been so upset by excitement and suspense that I have scarcely realized what was going on around me I couldn t stand another day like this I am sorry to hear it said Mr Parker I wish you had spoken of it this morning I don t want you to go to school if you don t feel well for of course you can t study Would you like to go to the concert with us to night No I thank you sir replied Leon I would rather stay at home Well ask Frank if he wants to go I have tickets and seats for all of us Leon went out again but instead of going toward the hall he turned into the sitting room The door of the library was open and Leon paused in front of it just long enough to take one look at the bookcase Then he went up to his room where he found Frank pacing back and forth in a state of great excitement He was afraid that everything had been discovered but one glance at his cousin s face reassured him What did your father say to you he inquired as soon as Leon had closed the door He asked me if I was sick My gracious my face is white isn t it said Leon as he glanced into the mirror and wanted to know if I felt like going to the concert to night I replied that I would rather stay at home and he told me to ask if you would like to go Good exclaimed Frank bringing his hands together with aloud slap As soon as they start we ll start I looked into the library before I came up continued Leon and I saw that the key of the bookcase is in one of the doors Isn t that lucky cried Frank who was almost ready to dance with delight Everything seems to be working in our favor Now in order to save time we had better pack our valises The manner in which the two boys went at this work showed that they were in earnest about it and that neither of them had the least idea of backing out They had already selected the clothing they intended to take with them and in half an hour after that the valises were packed and placed in the closet out of sight This done the boys sat down to talk about the glorious life upon which they were so soon to enter and to wait until the time came to leave the house which would be when Leon s father and mother had started for the concert Darkness came on apace and presently the boys heard Mr Parker calling from the foot of the stairs whereupon Leon went out into the hall and looked over the balusters Does Frank want to go with us asked the lawyer No sir shouted Frank from his seat in the window I ll stay with Leon Very well Now Leon don t go away to night The boy made no reply Do you understand me asked his father Yes sir said Leon Mr Parker being satisfied with the answer followed his wife out of the front door and the boys stood at the window and saw them go out of the gate and turn down the street When they were out of sight Leon sprang into the middle of the room and made an awkward attempt to dance a hornpipe I didn t promise him that I wouldn t go away to night did I said he gleefully I simply told him that I understood his order If he thinks that a boy of my age is going to be confined in a gloomy school room all day and then shut up in the yard at night as if he were an unruly dog he will find he has made a big mistake Now I ll go down and get my gun the first thing I do Don t be in a hurry said the cautious Frank Something might happen to bring your father back here and if he should chance to go to that drawer our cake would be all dough Don t touch the gun until we are ready to start It would never do for us to be caught now after we have carried out all our plans so nicely Shall we leave a note telling them why we ran away asked Leon No sir If they are anxious to know all they have to do is to think of the manner in which they have treated us I wish it would hurry up and grow dark The impatient boys spent another half hour in walking up and down their room and then Leon declared he would wait no longer At his suggestion Frank went out to the gate to reconnoitre and when he had satisfied himself that the coast was clear and that there was no danger of interruption he announced the fact by a shrill whistle and walked slowly toward the house When he entered the hall Leon was ascending the stairs with his recovered gun in his hands I feel as though I had found a long lost friend said he as he flourished the weapon over his head There ll be some astonished people in this house to morrow The boys went back to their room and when Leon s gun had been placed in its case and the powder flask and shot pouch belonging to it had been packed away in one of the valises they picked up their baggage took their weapons under their arms and went down the stairs They paused a moment on the threshold of the front door to make sure that there was no one passing along the street and then without a single feeling of regret they turned their backs upon their home and upon the friends they never expected or even wished to see again and hurried away The little town of Franklin toward which they bent their steps was situated on the railroad seven miles west of Eaton It was there that they intended to purchase tickets and board the cars By this piece of strategy they hoped to avoid meeting anybody who might recognize them The platform of the depot in Eaton was always crowded at train time and if they had been seen loitering about there with their guns and valises in their hands they might have been asked some questions that they did not care to answer Leon led the way avoiding the principal streets as much as he could and at the end of an hour the runaways struck the main road about two miles above the village Settling down into a steady walk they moved briskly along toward Franklin but before they had gone many rods they heard a wagon coming up behind them Let s wait and ask him to give us a ride said Frank He is going our way Not by a long shot answered Leon quickly I am acquainted with almost everybody about here and I won t take the risk This man might know me Let s hide and wait until he goes by Suiting the action to the word Leon sprang into the bushes that lined the nearest fence and crouched down among them his example being promptly followed by his cousin In a few minutes the wagon came up and passed their hiding place but not so the dog which trotted along a little distance in the rear industriously exploring the bushes on each side of the road His sharp nose quickly revealed to him the presence of the runaways and bounding toward the thicket in which they were concealed he set up a terrific yelping Get out there said Frank in a savage whisper lifting his rifle above his head The dog saw the motion and beat a hasty retreat but he went no farther than the middle of the road where he stopped and barked furiously CHAPTER XXII THE PRAIRIE HOTEL Knock him down with something whispered Leon in great excitement as he searched frantically about on the ground for some missile to throw at the dog Let s go out on the road suggested Frank He ll leave if we start toward him Yes but I don t want that man to see us for I don t know who he is Well he ll certainly see us if we allow this miserable cur to stay here and bark at us returned Frank The first thing you know his master will be back here to see what is up and we ll be I declare there he comes now Leon looked over the bushes and trembled in every limb when he saw the owner of the dog approaching He stopped by the side of the road picked up a formidable looking club and after trying its strength by striking it on the ground he hurried toward the thicket in which the runaways were concealed Sick em Maje sick em he shouted Take hold of em you rascal Thus encouraged the dog bounded into the bushes and in a moment more would have seized Frank by the leg had he not received a terrific punch in the ribs from Leon s double barrel That took all the fight out of him With a howl of anguish he ran back to the road and took refuge behind his master who halted very suddenly He looked first at the dog and then at the bushes and finally he began to back off toward his wagon It was evident that he did not think it safe to advance any nearer to the thicket but he seemed determined to find out what it was that had taken refuge there for after he had retreated a short distance he stopped and began swinging his club around his head In a moment more it would have been sent crashing into the fence corner had not Frank who could plainly see the motion called out What are you about there Good land o Goshen exclaimed the man lowering the threatening bludgeon Who be you and what did you crawl in there for Now you ve done it whispered Leon in great alarm That s Mr Jenkins the farmer who supplies us with wood I know his voice I ll talk to him whispered Frank in reply You stay here and when you hear me whistle come out and bring my gun with you As he said this he placed his rifle in his cousin s hand picked up his valise and walked out into the road The dog showed a disposition to be belligerent when he came in sight but a few words from his master accompanied by a flourish of the club put a stop to his demonstrations It s a pity that a fellow can t step aside to rest for a moment without having a dog set on him exclaimed Frank Is that the way you generally treat people in this country I declare to man I didn t know it was a boy that was hid in them bushes said the farmer apologetically I reckoned mebbe it was some kind of a varmint cause Maje kicked up such a row Goin my way Jump in and I ll give you a lift I am obliged to you but I would rather walk You can ride just as well as not urged the farmer I aint got no load Thank you I don t care to ride replied Frank rather impatiently I am in no hurry The man lingered as if he wanted to say something else but finally turned and went back to his wagon followed by Maje who looked over his shoulder and growled savagely at Frank by way of bidding him good night Presently the sound of wheels on the hard road told Frank that the farmer s wagon was in motion He waited until the sound grew faint in the distance and after looking up and down the road to make sure that there was no one else coming uttered a low whistle In a few minutes Leon came up and the two resumed their walk toward Franklin This was the first and last adventure that befell the boys during their journey to the frontier They reached the town of Franklin in a little less than two hours and there they purchased tickets for Albany at which place so they were told they could procure through tickets to St Louis The train arrived an hour later and in five minutes more the runaways were being carried rapidly toward the happy hunting grounds of which they had so often dreamed When they arrived at St Louis they boarded a steamer which carried them up the Missouri River and in due time they found themselves with their valises in their hands and their guns on their shoulders standing on the levee at St Joseph at which point they had decided to fit out for the plains Had they enjoyed themselves during their trip Certainly not No one could take pleasure in a railroad or steamboat ride under such circumstances One strange thing we have to record here is that Frank was no longer the leader Being a city boy he knew more about the ways of the world than his country cousin and Leon had leaned upon and looked to him for advice but after they had cut loose from home and friends and were surrounded by strangers Frank began to grow frightened and lost a good deal of his assurance He gradually fell back into the second place and Leon stepped to the front and assumed command of the expedition He had more pluck and determination than his cousin and now these qualities began to show themselves The boys stopped on the levee and gazed about them with the greatest interest St Joe did not look much like Eaton It was a frontier town at the time of which we write and everything was new and strange to the runaways Canvas covered wagons such as emigrants use were constantly passing bearded men in red shirts and high top boots were lounging about and now and then an Indian wrapped up to the chin in his blanket would walk by with dignified step Well here we are said Leon at length and I must confess that things don t look just as I thought they would No they don t and I wish to goodness that we were safe at home again said Frank giving utterance to the thought that had passed through his mind a score of times since he left Eaton I am afraid we can t make a success of it It is too late to talk that way said his cousin You know that we discussed the matter thoroughly before we started and made up our minds that we could face anything that came in our way But I didn t know that frontiersmen were such rough fellows Just look at these men standing around Their appearance is enough to frighten one If you are so easily frightened what will you do when we get out to the mountains asked Leon Frank made no audible reply but to himself he said I don t intend to go to the mountains I am just as far from home already as I want to be Our first hard work must be to hunt up a hotel continued Leon and our next to find some experienced man who is good natured enough to give us some advice The boys walked up the levee and turned into the first street that they found and which proved to be the principal thoroughfare As they strolled slowly along their attention was frequently attracted by such notices as these which were posted in some of the store windows Parties fitted out for the plains HUNTERS TRAPPERS AND MINERS SUPPLIES They lingered long in front of these windows and Leon s enthusiasm over the rifles hunting knives and revolvers that were there displayed was so contagious that Frank forgot his homesickness and began to take a little more interest in things Here s the place we re looking for exclaimed Leon at length As he spoke he pointed to a sign that hung over the sidewalk Frank looked and saw that it bore the words PRAIRIE HOTEL Of course all the plainsmen must stop here continued Leon We ll hang around for a day or two until we make the acquaintance of some of them and perhaps they will tell us all we want to know Let s go in Frank followed his cousin through the door and found himself in the principal room of the hotel which did duty as a parlor office and bar Every chair and bench was occupied and there was a crowd of men about the counter who were talking loudly They were all rough looking fellows and Frank trembled when he saw that some of them wore revolvers and knives strapped about their waists These were mainly gold hunters who had just returned from the mountains They had become so accustomed to wearing their weapons while they were in the mines that they did not think to take them off even though they were among civilized people The room was dingy and smoky and reminded Frank of the sailors boarding houses into which he had often glanced as he passed along the wharves of Boston The boys first impulse after they had run their eyes about the apartment and taken a good look at its occupants was to open the door and go out again but before they could act upon it the proprietor of the hotel who had seen them enter came briskly out from behind the bar and approached them He was as roughly dressed as any of his guests and looked so fierce that when he reached out his hand for Leon s valise the boy surrendered it at once Can I do anything for you said he Leon did not think it would be safe to tell the man that he had concluded to look further for lodgings so he asked in reply Can we stay here for a day or two You re mighty right was the answer You re not from the plains No sir but we re going there Then this is just the place for you Some of the boys here the proprietor jerked his head toward the men standing before the bar are getting ready to start and you can go with them The host deposited Leon s baggage behind the bar and when he came back after Frank s gun and valise the latter said Can t you show us to our room and take our luggage up there I can but there s all sorts of fellows stop here and you had better let me take care of your things I ll be responsible for them But we would like to perform our ablutions said Frank Which exclaimed the host We want a good wash explained Leon Oh Why didn t you say so There is the sink and plenty of towels and soap said the man nodding his head toward a corner of the room Pitch in as soon as you please With this remark the proprietor as if he considered that he had done his full duty toward his new guests returned to his place behind the bar CHAPTER XXIII A FRIENDLY HUNTER The boys walked up to the sink and took a survey of it It contained two tin basins Several pieces of hard soap were deposited upon a little shelf over it and the towels looked as though they had done service for weeks I have been used to better things than these said Frank who could hardly bring himself to touch one of the dingy basins So have I answered Leon but what s the good of growling When you get out to the mountains you ll have to wash your hands and face in a brook and dry them upon a piece of buckskin We ve got to rough it that s what we came out here for and we might as well begin now as a month later We ll get used to it by the time we are settled as hunters Frank told himself very emphatically that he never would be settled as a hunter He was heartily tired of roughing it already and would have been glad to start for home long ago but he knew by the way his cousin talked and acted that it would be of no use to propose such a thing so after a good deal of thinking he had determined upon a course of action that was mean and cowardly in the extreme He only waited for a favorable opportunity to carry his plans into execution After washing their hands and faces and drying them upon the cleanest part of the long used towels the boys looked around until they found a couple of chairs that had just been vacated and sat down to listen to the conversation of the miners who had by this time drawn away from the bar and were now seated around the stove talking over their experience They talked principally about gold hunting but presently one of them launched out into a narrative that held his listeners spellbound It was about a fight he and his comrades had with a war party of Cheyennes who drove them away from their diggings This set the others going on the same subject and from that hour until supper was announced the boys listened to stories of adventure and hair breadth escapes from wild animals and Indians that were enough to frighten anyone For the first time since leaving home Leon told himself that perhaps he had mistaken his calling If tall broad shouldered powerful looking men like these could be driven about like sheep by the wild inhabitants of the mountains and plains what could a boy like himself do in combat with them As for Frank the last particle of his courage oozed out at the ends of his fingers and he was all the more determined to carry out the plans he had already formed He found that he had entertained very erroneous opinions regarding frontier life The heroes of his favorite books could not only whip a dozen Indians very easily and come off without a scratch but they could go alone into a hostile camp and rescue a partner who had been captured by them Here were men however live men too who were willing to acknowledge that they had been whipped that they had seen quite enough of savage life and that they would be glad to reach home where they could live in peace Leon said Frank suddenly don t you think you had better give me half the money you ve got left You pay all the bills and that looks as though I was sponging on you Never mind that was the reply It s all in the family But what if somebody should go through you urged Frank I suppose there are pickpockets here as well as in the cities If you lost your share I d have mine left to fall back on But I don t intend that anybody shall go through me answered Leon I ll take good care of the money and pay your bills and mine too You had better keep close watch over it said Frank to himself for if I once get my hands on it I ll take enough of it to see me safely back to Boston I bet you Leon he added almost desperately I am tired of this Let s go back before it s too late We must go some time Ah ha exclaimed his cousin That s the reason you want half the money is it Well you can t have it It is all very well for you to talk about going home for you will go straight to Boston and none of your friends there will ever know that you ran away your folks of course won t say anything about it But if I go home I must go among those who know everything No sir I ll never see Eaton again until I have made a name for myself Frank seeing that he had made a mistake tried to turn the matter off with a laugh and hastened to assure his cousin that if he was still determined to go through he Frank would stand by him through thick and thin He hoped in this way to throw Leon off his guard so that the latter would relax his vigilance and give him a chance to steal what was left of the six hundred dollars for that was what he had determined to do We may add that he finally succeeded in his object and came very near getting himself into a desperate scrape by it When supper was announced the boys followed the crowd into an adjoining room and took the seats that were pointed out to them by their host It was not just such an apartment as that in which they had been accustomed to take their meals at home It was almost as dingy as the bar The rough tables were not very clean and the dishes and viands were scattered about without the least regard to order They looked Leon told himself as though the waiter had stood off and thrown them at the table and left them wherever they landed But there was plenty to eat and the boys being very hungry made a hearty supper When they had satisfied their appetites they went back to the bar room and sat down on one of the benches while the gold hunters smoked their pipes and told stories of life in the mines When eight o clock came Leon walked up to the bar and asked the landlord to show him and his cousin to their room In compliance with the request the man lighted a tallow candle and leading the boys up a narrow winding stairway ushered them into the most cheerless bedroom they had ever seen There was no carpet on the floor and there were no chairs on which to deposit their clothing In fact the room contained nothing except a couple of beds which looked as though the person who made them up must have been in a very great hurry You two tumble into this one said the landlord placing the candle on the floor and nodding his head toward one of the beds You needn t mind locking your door cause there s another fellow belongs up here Who is he asked Frank He s a hunter and a mighty good one too I reckon for he used to be post hunter at Fort Laramie Is he all right Is he exclaimed the landlord He s the best fellow in the world good natured he hasn t had but three fights since he s been here free hearted and spends his money like water He killed eight hundred buffalo this season and he s going back to kill some more You needn t mind putting out your candle cause he ll be up directly He always goes to bed early since he and his money quit Good night That s just the man we want to see exclaimed Leon when the landlord had left the room He can tell us everything we want to know and if he will let us we can t do better than go with him The boys had hardly got into bed Leon took the precaution to place his trousers which contained the money under his pillow when a heavy step sounded in the hall the door opened and the third occupant of the room stalked in He was roughly dressed and carried a knife and revolver in his belt The runaways who looked at him with great interest could not see much of his face for the lower part of it was concealed by thick bushy whiskers which looked as though they had never been combed and his slouch hat was drawn low over his forehead There was something forbidding about him but the boys could not have told what it was Hallo pilgrims said he as he placed his hands on his hips and looked down at the runaways Are you the kids who are going out on the plains Yes sir answered Leon Come from the States I reckon didn t you Yes sir and we re looking for somebody who can tell us just what we ought to do We re going out to the mountains to hunt and trap Do you think we can make a living at it Finest business in the world was the encouraging reply I know lots of fellows who are getting rich at it It s a trifle rough sometimes if you get into the Injuns hunting grounds but all you ve got to do is to grab your spelter and skip out I understand that you used to be post hunter at Fort Laramie said Frank Yes and I got kicked out cause me and the colonel couldn t hitch hosses replied the man cheerfully If he had said that he had been detected in an attempt to rob the sutler s drawer and had been obliged to leave the neighborhood of the fort in order to escape arrest he would have been nearer the truth Well we are green began Leon Yes I knowed you were tenderfeet interrupted the hunter And we want to find somebody of experience who will take us in charge and manage matters for us added Leon We don t know what kind of an outfit we want or where to go to find good hunting grounds Have you got any money Plenty of it answered Leon readily more than enough to foot all our O Frank what do you mean he added changing his tone very suddenly as his cousin s elbow was brought against his side with considerable force Frank made no reply and the hunter presently continued You don t want to let anybody coax you into spending much of it for an outfit in this place cause things is so dear All you want is a hoss saddle and bridle and a pair of saddle bags In the saddle bags you can carry a little bacon corn meal salt pepper coffee and sugar too if you want it as I reckon you do being tenderfeet Anything else you want to eat you can shoot as you go along When do you start for the fort To morrow Now why won t you let us go with you We ve got money and Again Frank s elbow came in vigorous contact with his cousin s ribs Then it began to creep through Leon s head that perhaps he was saying too much about his wealth so he resolved to take the hints Frank had given him and drop the subject I ll take care of you answered the hunter I was a tenderfoot myself once and would have been glad to have somebody do as much for me Leon drew a long breath and told himself that he had done a very sensible thing when he turned into the Prairie Hotel Here was a man who was an experienced hunter who was recommended by the landlord as being the best fellow in the world who knew just what they wanted and would assist in fitting them out for the plains Things could not have worked more to his liking The hunter had by this time extinguished the light and got into bed but he did not seem at all inclined to sleep He talked incessantly for three hours and kept the boys interested in what he had to say regarding a hunter and trapper s life During the progress of the conversation the boys learned that their friend s name was Eben Webster that he had left all his outfit except his horse at Laramie that he had come down to St Joe to rest after a hard season s work on the plains and that having seen enough of civilization for the present he was going to start back on the following morning He said he would pick out some saddle horses for the boys show them the way to the fort where he would secure the rest of their outfit for them and then he would lead them to the mountains where they would spend the rest of the winter together in hunting and trapping They were sure to have the best of luck for he knew right where to go to find plenty of game and if he didn t make good hunters of them before spring so that they could start on their own hook he would give them all the furs he caught Leon was highly excited over the prospect and it was a long time after the conversation ceased before he fell asleep CHAPTER XXIV ON THE TRAIL You re a pretty fellow you are This was the way in which Leon was greeted by his cousin the next morning when he awoke It was broad daylight The hunter had arisen at the first peep of day and the boys were alone in their room What s the matter now asked Leon as he sat up in bed pulled his trousers from under his pillow and thrust his hand into his pocket to make sure that his money was safe I haven t been doing anything No you haven t made a blunder this morning for you haven t had time but you made two fearful ones last night replied Frank What in the world induced you to tell that man that you had a pocketful of money He is a stranger to us and we don t know whether he is honest or not Perhaps I did talk a little too much said Leon reflectively But I wanted to give him to understand that if he would let us go with him we would be no expense to him Well another time don t be in such haste to take a person you don t know into your confidence Leon could make no defence so he said nothing He lay for a long time thinking over the conversation he and his cousin had had with the hunter the night before and there was one thing upon which he dwelt with no little satisfaction This new friend had not tried to turn them from their purpose On the contrary he had said all he could to encourage them If his statements were worthy of belief and Leon did not doubt them in the least a hunter s life was one of ease and romance and the only one that was all sunshine It was true that a hunter was sometimes in danger of his life but that was a matter of no moment in the opinion of Eben Webster It only served to put him on his mettle and to relieve the monotony of his existence Eben according to his own story was a typical hunter He was of the same stamp as those doughty heroes who figure so extensively in cheap novels He had time and again whipped all the hostile warriors that could get around him and as for bears and panthers he thought no more of shooting them than Leon did of bringing down a grouse or squirrel The boy could not help telling himself that Eben s stories differed widely from those to which he had listened in the bar room but still his faith in his new friend was not shaken He believed the latter because he pictured life in the mountains just as he hoped to find it It never occurred to him that the hunter had told him a pack of falsehoods but he found out afterward that such was the case The loud ringing of a bell at the foot of the stairs interrupted Leon s meditations and brought him and his cousin out upon the floor in a twinkling They dressed with all haste and descending to the bar room found the guests loitering about awaiting the call to breakfast Eben was there and he sat beside the boys at the table His tongue ran as rapidly as it had run the night before and among other things he told the boys that he had been busy that morning looking up a mount for them and had found just what they wanted A couple of gold hunters who were stopping at the hotel and were going to start for the States that day offered to sell the horses they had ridden from the mines for a mere song twenty dollars apiece including saddles bridles and saddle bags They can t be good for anything if they can be bought as cheap as that said Leon My father s horse cost six hundred dollars They re good enough to carry you to Laramie answered the hunter and when we get there you can trade em off to the Injuns for better ones What I want to make you understand is that you don t want to spend a cent more in this town than you are obliged to Things are so dear This was the burden of Eben s advice to the boys and he repeated it so often while they were purchasing their outfit that they began to wonder at it Perhaps we shall presently see why it was that the man was so anxious to have Leon take good care of his money Breakfast being over the miners who owned the horses were hunted up and Eben and the runaways accompanied them to the stable The animals were brought out for their inspection but the boys knew no more about them after they got through looking them over than they did before they saw them They were mustangs and although in very good condition they were by no means handsome and Frank did not hesitate to say so Handsome is that handsome does pilgrim said one of the miners These hosses have been through two or three fights with Injuns and if it hadn t been that they re just a trifle faster n chain lightning me and my partner wouldn t be here in St Joe to day If we wasn t going back to the States we wouldn t think of parting with em These words raised the mustangs wonderfully in Leon s estimation Without any further hesitation he pulled out his roll of bills and paid for them on the spot The roll was still a pretty large one although he had paid his own and his cousin s railroad and steamboat fare out of it It was large enough to make Eben s eyes grow to twice their usual size and if the boys had seen the expression that settled on his face and could have read the thoughts that passed through his mind it is possible that their own eyes would have been opened The horses having been purchased but little remained to be done and in an hour more the boys accompanied by the hunter were on their way to the plains Instead of their valise for which the landlord had generously allowed them a dollar on their bill the boys carried strapped behind their saddles two small meal bags which contained their clothing The saddle bags were filled with provisions that the hunter had selected for them and they were each provided with a lariat and picket pin for staking out their horses at night Eben had protested earnestly against the expenditure of money for blankets declaring that the boys heavy overcoats would afford them all the protection they needed at night but Frank declared that he had never read of a hunter lying before his fire wrapped in an overcoat and so the blankets were purchased The first few days passed without the occurrence of any incident that is worthy of note They travelled rapidly for Eben declared that haste was necessary It would not be many days he said before the cold winter storms would begin to sweep over the prairie in fact he had never known them to hold off so long before and if they were caught out in a blizzard nothing but certain death awaited them So he had the boys up every morning before daylight allowed them but a very short rest at noon and kept them in the saddle long after dark It is needless to say that not being accustomed to riding on horseback they suffered severely but the tireless mustangs on which they were mounted did not seem to mind it in the least They were as willing to go at nine o clock at night as they were in the morning During the first week the boys saw absolutely nothing along their line of travel for their time was fully occupied in trying to find an easy position in the saddle but their aches and pains gradually left them as they became hardened to it and then Leon began to take some interest in the new and strange sights that met his gaze on every side He was very jubilant Eben was talkative and Frank was frightened and homesick And the fact was he saw a good deal to frighten him Every mile of the road was marked by the bleaching bones of horses and cattle telling of disasters that had befallen some unfortunate emigrant and now and then the sight of a human grave or the ruins of a dug out would make the cold chills creep all over him There was a good deal of travel on the trail for that time of the year Every day they passed long lines of heavily loaded freight wagons and they in turn were passed by the coaches of the Overland Stage and Mail Company which drawn by four fleet horses and escorted by cavalrymen who galloped along on each side of them whisked by at the rate of ten miles an hour They also saw trains going the other way empty freight wagons which a few weeks before had gone out loaded with government stores and others driven by disgusted gold hunters and emigrants who were making all haste to reach the States The hunter always made it a point to travel rapidly whenever he and his companions met any of these returning wagons He took particular pains also when they began to think of stopping for the night to ride so far beyond any camp they might find on the trail that the boys could not go back to visit it He did not intend to allow his young companions an opportunity to converse with any of the emigrants for fear that they might hear something discouraging but in spite of all his precautions they learned something along the route which Eben himself had learned at a station near which they made their camp a few nights before but which he studiously kept from the boys One afternoon when they were about twenty miles from Julesburg and on their way toward Fort Laramie one of the mail coaches overtook them accompanied as usual by four cavalrymen As the coach dashed by the sergeant who commanded the escort drew up his horse with a jerk exclaiming Where bound pilgrims Fort Laramie replied Leon who was the first to speak Laramie echoed the sergeant You will never see it this year You ll do well if you get to Julesburg You want to keep up with us if you can because the reds have been jumping down on some of the coaches So saying the officer touched his horse with his spurs and galloped away in pursuit of the coach CHAPTER XXV FRANK STARTS FOR HOME The sergeant s words produced the utmost consternation among those who heard them The boys turned white with terror and cast anxious glances toward the surrounding swells momentarily expecting to see a band of hostile warriors rise over their summits and swoop down upon them Eben was alarmed too but he did not show it as plainly as his companions did There aint a word of truth in it he said I have been along this trail more n a hundred times and never saw no Injuns yet They wouldn t be roaming about the plains at this season of the year anyway They are up on the Big Horn getting ready for winter But what did the soldier mean when he said that we will do well if we reach Julesburg asked Frank in a trembling voice He meant that it was going to snow replied the hunter But I can read the signs like a book and I know it won t snow for a week yet But even if it does storm we don t care for we shall be in Julesburg to morrow With this answer Eben tried to turn the conversation into another channel but the boys being terribly frightened could talk about nothing but Indians and speculate upon their chances of reaching a place of safety The hunter stood it as long as he could and then said almost savagely If there were Injuns about you wouldn t see so many single wagons along the road The emigrants would wait for one another and make up a strong train so that they could defend themselves Leon who had all faith in the hunter was somewhat reassured by these words but Frank s terror increased every time he recalled the sergeant s warning Just before dark they passed a camp on the bank of a little stream and Frank urged Eben to stop there so that they could have company during the night but the hunter following his usual custom rode by at a gallop and as Leon went with him Frank had to follow or be left alone I can t stand this any longer and I won t either said Frank to himself as he galloped along behind his companions But after all I don t see how I am going to help myself I have waited and watched for an opportunity to get my hands on that money ever since we left St Joe and I haven t seen a ghost of a chance Frank was almost ready to cry with vexation and alarm He did not know what to do but as it happened a way was most unexpectedly opened for him to carry out his plans that very night Eben kept his horse in a gallop until the emigrant s camp was left at least five miles behind and then drawing rein in a little clump of willows announced that they would stop there until morning The weary boys swung themselves from their saddles and set about the performance of certain duties that had been assigned them when the journey first began Frank s business was to cut wood enough to keep the fire burning all night and although he appeared to work industriously he spent more than half his time in watching his cousin s movements He saw him take his saddle bags from his horse lift up the flap that covered one of the pockets and thrust his hand into the bag Then he placed the bags upon the ground near the spot on which the fire was to be built and piled his saddle blankets and overcoat upon them taking care to arrange all the articles in such a position that he could tell at a glance if any of them had been disturbed He has done that every noon and night for the last week soliloquized Frank and now I am satisfied that the money is in those saddle bags Mine look exactly like his and if I see a chance I ll exchange with him and leave I am sure I could find my way back to that emigrant s camp and perhaps I could induce him to let me ride in his wagon as far as St Joe The supper consisting of bacon and crackers which Leon had purchased at one of the mail stations was ready in due time and when it had been disposed of the travellers lay down beside the fire Eben on his soldier s overcoat and the boys on their blankets and talked themselves to sleep that is Leon and the hunter went to sleep but Frank kept wide awake He had no intention of closing his eyes that night Before lying down Leon had placed his saddle bags across his saddle in the same position they occupied when he was on horseback and the pocket which contained the money was under his shoulders while his head rested in the hollow of the saddle which he used as a pillow These precautions almost disheartened Frank who for six long hours lay there within easy reach of his cousin revolving in his mind various plans for obtaining possession of the coveted treasure Two or three times he reached out his hand and tried to pull the saddle bags from under Leon s shoulders but every time he did so Leon stirred in his sleep and Frank was obliged to desist He was almost ready to give up in despair when to his great joy his cousin in tossing about and trying to find a more comfortable position rolled partly off his rude bed Frank was prompt to seize upon the opportunity thus presented for it was now or never As quick as thought he drew the saddle bags toward him unbuckled the flap and plunged his hand in the pocket As he did so his fingers came in contact with something wrapped up in a piece of paper Hardly able to suppress the cry of exultation that arose to his lips he seized upon it and raising himself to his knees untied the paper with hands that trembled violently The fire which the hunter had replenished several times during the night was burning brightly and by the aid of the light it threw out Frank saw that he had found what he wanted The next thing was to leave the camp without arousing either of his companions Illustration FRANK STEALS THE MONEY Hastily buckling the flap he pushed the saddle bags back to their place and arose to his feet He spent a moment in arranging his blankets so that anyone who took a casual glance at them would believe that they covered a human form took his overcoat on his arm picked up his rifle and accoutrements which he had placed at the head of his bed and stole silently away into the darkness He walked a few rods with noiseless footsteps and then breaking into a run flew over the ground at a rate of speed he had never equalled before I ve got it I ve got it at last he kept whispering to himself and if I can only keep it I am sure of seeing home and friends once more I will keep it I ll fight till I drop before I ll give it up I am rather sorry that I had to take it all but I was afraid that if I stopped to divide it one or the other of them would wake up and discover me Well Leon stands in no need of it for he doesn t want to go home Besides he has Eben to take care of him while I must look out for myself The boy would have been greatly amazed if anyone had told him that the hunter had been laying his plans to do just what he Frank had done Eben never intended to guide the boys to Fort Laramie His object was to lead them into the wilderness beyond Julesburg where there were but few wagons to be met at that season of the year steal Leon s money and Frank s rifle and blankets and leave them to shift for themselves But Frank got the start of him and we shall see what the hunter did about it Frank very soon ran himself out of breath and was obliged to settle down into a walk Knowing that his absence would ere long be discovered and that an effort would be made to overtake him and recover the money he stopped frequently to listen for sounds of pursuit holding himself in readiness to leave the trail and seek a hiding place in the grass if he heard the sound of horses hoofs But Leon and the hunter still slept soundly and Frank went on his way unmolested The five miles that lay between his own camp and the camp of the emigrant seemed to have lengthened out wonderfully since Frank passed that way but just as the day was breaking he came within sight of the canvas cover of the wagon and saw the light of the camp fire shining through it Breaking into a run he dashed up to the wagon creating no little excitement among the emigrant s children who ran to their mother and clung to her dress for protection The woman looked up from her cooking the man who was harnessing his mules faced suddenly about and both stared at him as if to ask what he meant by his intrusion My friend said Frank speaking rapidly and keeping his gaze directed down the trail in the direction from which he had come will you do a favor for me Anything in reason was the encouraging reply Thank you said Frank gratefully Do you see this rifle It cost forty dollars in Boston I will give it to you if you will let me hide in your wagon and ride with you until we reach one of the mail stations I have a little money in my possession and am in danger of being robbed Mercy preserve us exclaimed the emigrant s wife You see continued Frank I started from St Joe intending to go to Fort Laramie but I have seen enough of this Western country and now I want to go home I don t blame you said the emigrant We want to go home too Then you can imagine how I should feel if I were robbed and left stranded here on the plains I assure you that if you will let me go with you and hide in your wagon until all danger is past At this moment Frank discovered something moving rapidly along the trail about half a mile away He looked closely at it and saw that it was a horseman who was urging his way forward at full speed That s Eben said he in a husky voice He is the man who wants to rob me Don t you believe a word he says to you If he asks you about me tell him that you haven t seen me So saying Frank sprang into the wagon and began covering himself up with the bedding that was scattered over the bottom In a second more he was concealed boots and all If we tell him that we ll be lying said the woman thoughtfully Well mebbe it would be stretching things just a little said the man slowly but in a case like this that s a mighty fine rifle of his n Jane and squirrels are plenty in Kaintuck And this rifle will bring them out of the tallest hickory in the woods said Frank sticking his head out from under the quilts for a moment and then drawing it hastily back again The emigrant once more turned his attention to his mules the woman went on with her preparations for breakfast and presently the horseman galloped up to the camp and drew rein CHAPTER XXVI EBEN SHOWS HIS COLORS Say pilgrim have you seen a boy dressed in store clothes and carrying a rifle in his hands pass along the trail this morning inquired the horseman The concealed runaway who had taken care to leave a little opening among the quilts so that he could hear all that was said trembled violently as the familiar tones fell upon his ear It was the hunter sure enough He held his breath in suspense while he waited for the emigrant s reply Nary boy drawled the man There aint nobody passed this camp since sundown last night Then he must have left the trail and taken to the grass said Eben I ve missed him somewhere but I ll find him if I have to hunt the whole country over Has he been a doing of anything I should say he had He stole over three hundred dollars out of my saddle bags early this morning The exclamations this statement called forth from the emigrant and his wife made Frank tremble again What if they should take it into their heads to believe Eben s story instead of his own The emigrant s next words however put him somewhat at his ease Well I aint seen him go past here said he What do you reckon you ll do with him if you ketch him The hunter did not answer the question in words He drew his revolver and held it off at arm s length as if he were taking aim at something at the same time digging his heels into the sides of his horse which sprang away at the top of his speed When Eben was out of sight the emigrant stepped upon the wagon tongue and called to Frank Look here neighbor he exclaimed that man says you robbed him How is that There isn t a word of truth in it replied Frank He never had his hands on the money I ve got in my pocket Did you take a good look at him Well now take a good look at me and make up your mind which of us you would rather believe There s something in that said the emigrant You look like an honest boy and I hope you be You d best stay in there a spell I reckon That feller may come back after a while and if he gets his eye on you I am afraid it will go hard with you I ll hand you in a bite to eat The emigrant stepped down from the wagon tongue and when he came back again he placed in Frank s hand a tin plate containing a piece of bacon and corn bread and a quart cup filled with coffee He and his family ate their breakfast while seated around the fire When the meal was over the mules were hitched to the wagon the woman and her children climbed in and the emigrant mounted his seat and drove off They had not been on the trail more than two hours before Frank who was constantly on the watch discovered Eben coming back The instant he caught sight of him he made a dash for his hiding place and the emigrant and his wife covered him up with the quilts There was no need of all this trouble however for the hunter never looked toward the wagon as he galloped by and only shook his head sullenly when the emigrant asked him if he had found the boy of whom he was in search Frank s adventures on the plains were now ended For a few hours he was extremely nervous and uneasy and always sought his hiding place whenever a horseman wearing a military overcoat made his appearance on the trail behind them but Eben was a good many miles away and it was a long time before Frank heard of him again He remained with the hospitable emigrant until they arrived at one of the stations of the Overland Stage Company and there he took leave of him and his family after presenting the man with his rifle according to promise and secured a seat in a coach bound for Atchison Having seen him fairly on his way toward home we will bid him good by for the present and return to Leon whom we left fast asleep on his blanket When Frank had been gone a little more than an hour and the first gray streaks of dawn were beginning to make their appearance in the east Eben suddenly sat up and looked about him After stretching his arms and yawning he arose and mended the fire and it was while he was thus engaged that he discovered Frank s bed was empty He looked toward the place where the horses were staked out and saw that they were all there but he noticed that Frank s rifle and overcoat were gone and his suspicions were aroused at once Stepping quickly to Leon s side he seized him by the shoulder and shook him roughly Pilgrim pilgrim he shouted in stentorian tones Wake up here That pardner o your n s skipped Leon was wide awake in an instant He looked toward Frank s bed and uttering an exclamation of alarm caught up his saddle bags unbuckled one of the flaps and thrust his hand into the pocket Everything that ought to have been there was there except the article of which he was in search He tumbled the contents of both pockets on the ground tossed them in all directions but the little round package wrapped in a piece of newspaper was not to be found It s gone gasped Leon his hands falling helplessly by his side You don t mean the money cried the hunter whose excitement was fully equal to Leon s Yes I do mean the money replied the boy who felt like yelling with indignation It beats me how he got it for I have kept a close watch over it ever since he told me that he wanted to go home There were more than three hundred dollars in that roll too The hunter muttered something that sounded very much like the heaviest kind of an imprecation You re a nice one to have money said he angrily Why didn t you keep it in your pocket Because I was afraid it would work out and get lost Where are you going said Leon as the hunter turned and ran toward his horse I m going to have that money back said Eben in savage tones He can t be far off for he hasn t been gone long enough to put many miles between him and us He was in his bed the last time I fixed the fire and fast asleep too for I saw him If I come up with him he ll never steal any more money I bet you Don t be too hard on him said Leon who did not like the expression he saw in his companion s face He is my cousin you know I don t care if he s the President s cousin We make short work of thieves in this country You stay and watch the camp until I come back Eben put the saddle and bridle on his horse in a remarkably short space of time and springing upon his back galloped away paying no heed to Leon s repeated request that he would not harm Frank if he succeeded in overtaking him I am really afraid that boy has got himself into a box thought Leon as he settled back on his hard bed I never saw a man in such a rage as Eben is He takes a good deal of interest in my affairs but I hope he ll not let his zeal carry him too far Frank has got me into a box too for if I should grow tired of life in the mountains and conclude to go back to the States how am I to get there The indignation Leon felt when he first discovered that his money had been stolen had given away to a feeling of uneasiness He was certain that Eben would overtake his cousin A boy on foot could not possibly escape from a man on horseback especially on the plains and if he would simply bring him back and hand over the three hundred dollars all would be well but he was afraid that the angry hunter might take it into his head to punish Frank in some way He felt the loss keenly but he was not troubled concerning the future Eben had told him that the traders who were located at the various posts during the winter were in the habit of furnishing supplies on credit to responsible hunters and trappers who would bind themselves to sell their furs to no one but the man of whom the supplies were obtained So the loss of his money would not prevent him and Eben from spending a few months in the mountains as they had intended to do But still he wanted funds to use in case of emergency and he hoped that Eben would succeed in overtaking Frank Leon did not cook any breakfast for he could not have eaten a mouthful if he had tried his anxiety and suspense were too great He spent four hours in walking back and forth between the camp fire and the trail and presently he saw Eben coming back The expression his face wore when he rode up made Leon afraid to speak to him It was evident that he had had his trouble for his pains While the boy was wondering how Frank could have effected his escape the hunter dismounted and walking over to the place where the two mustangs were staked out he cut the lariats with which they were confined and set them at liberty This done he hurried into the camp and without saying a word proceeded to gather up all the articles Frank had left behind as well as those belonging to Leon He picked up the saddle bags all the blankets the meal bags which contained the boys clothing and threw them across the neck of his horse After balancing them so that they would not fall off he came back and picked up Leon s double barrel and also the powder flask and shot pouch belonging to it What are you going to do asked the boy who had watched the singular movements with surprise not unmingled with alarm I am off for the mountains answered Eben in sullen tones I have the best notion in the world to knock you over before I go for not keeping that money in your pocket where it belonged But what are you taking my horse for If you are going to the mountains why can t I go with you The hunter made no reply He sprang upon the back of his own horse and galloped away followed by the liberated mustangs and leaving Leon standing beside the fire almost overwhelmed with astonishment and terror CHAPTER XXVII ALONE AND FRIENDLESS Leon who was by no means dull of comprehension had no difficulty in finding an explanation of the hunter s actions The latter had deliberately robbed and deserted the boy who had trusted him This conviction came upon Leon with stunning force and literally crushed him to the ground He fell down beside the fire and for a few moments gave way to the most violent grief Then suddenly recovering himself he sprang to his feet and ran swiftly down the trail shouting the hunter s name and imploring him to come back But Eben was out of hearing In a few seconds more he disappeared over a swell and Leon was alone on the prairie How he managed to exist during the next few hours he never knew He was animated with but one idea and that was to reach Julesburg in the shortest possible space of time He knew it was a military post and he hoped to find the hunter there If he did he would seek an interview with the commandant tell him his story and have the thief arrested But how much better off will I be then than I am now sobbed Leon after he had thought the matter over I shall get my property back of course but what use will it be to me I would not dare start for St Joe alone for there are Indians along the route and I have heard Eben say that it will not be long before the roads will be blocked with snow I suppose I might find a train of empty freight wagons going back but who will feed me when I have no money to pay for what I eat I can t become a hunter now that Eben has gone back on me and I Oh I wish I had never seen or heard of Frank Fuller I wouldn t be here now if he had stayed at home Leon ran until he was all out of breath and then slackened his speed to a walk He had heard the hunter say that the nearest post was only ten miles distant but the miles on the prairies are longer than they are in the States and it was past the middle of the afternoon when he came in sight of the little collection of tents and mud houses that bore the name of Julesburg He directed his course toward the stockade which stood on a hill a little apart from the town but when he came to the gate he paused for there was an armed sentinel pacing back and forth in front of it Do you allow strangers in here asked the boy timidly Yes if they come on business answered the sentry Leon replying that he had come on business and very important business too walked through the gate and paused to see which way he would go next He was surprised at the extent of the fortifications In the center was a parade ground large enough to admit of the evolutions of a regiment This parade ground was surrounded by broad level walks the space between the walks and the stockade being occupied with warehouses the sutler and trader s stores barracks officers quarters and stables all built of sun dried bricks A tall flag staff arose from the parade ground and from it floated the Stars and Stripes Leon could see nothing of Eben but he did see three or four men lounging in front of the open door of one of the buildings and toward them he bent his steps The building proved to be a stable and the men were government teamsters When they saw Leon approaching they ceased their conversation and looked at him with curiosity Good afternoon said the boy speaking in as steady a voice as he could command Do any of you happen to know a hunter named Eben Webster I reckon replied one of the men and we don t know nothing good of him neither Have you seen him about here to day asked Leon About here About this fort exclaimed another teamster Not much He ll never come through one of our gates unless he comes with a guard over him You don t want no dealings with him pilgrim He s a thief I know it replied Leon his lips quivering and his eyes filling with tears He stripped me of everything I had except the clothes I stand in and left me alone on the prairie The teamsters began to prick up their ears when they heard this and two or three of their companions who were at work in the stable came to the door to listen to the conversation Leon finding that he had an attentive audience began and told the story of his troubles hoping that if he could get the men interested they would assist him in some way He told nothing but the truth as far as he went but he omitted one very important thing which the wagon master an old gray headed man who had not yet spoken supplied for him after asking a few questions Have you got a father he asked Leon replied that he had And a mother too The boy nodded his head Then my young tenderfoot you re a runaway that s what you are No father or mother livin would let a kid like you come out here to make his bread and bacon by huntin and trappin You re a nice lad to talk about roughin it in the mountains aint you now Jest step over here longside of me and look at yourself The old wagon master spoke seriously and his words did not raise a laugh at Leon s expense as the latter expected they would He hung his head and it was all he could do to keep his tears from bursting out afresh One of the teamsters declared that it was a perfect shame and this remark brought about a general conversation during which Leon learned how foolish he had been in taking into his confidence a man with whom he was not acquainted Eben had never been post hunter at Laramie nor anywhere else He was nothing but a renegade who had married an Indian wife that he might share in the annuities that are yearly distributed among the different friendly tribes Leon was also informed that Eben had fled the country a few months before to escape arrest that he had never killed eight hundred buffaloes during all the years he had been on the plains and that he was too lazy and too big a coward to spend a winter in the mountains hunting and trapping He much preferred to settle down in his teepee and eat government rations As for the articles he had stolen the boy might just as well give them up for lost Eben had doubtless drawn a bee line for the place where the band to which he belonged was encamped and Leon would never see him again While this conversation was going on the wagon master arose and walked away He was gone but a few minutes and when he came back he beckoned to Leon who promptly joined him Pilgrim said he as they walked away together I wish I was your father for bout half an hour so t I could gin you a good trouncin to pay you for runnin away from a good home and comin out here where you aint got no sort of business in the world But seein I aint your father I m kinder sorry for you though you aint wuth no sorrer and I ve been sayin a good word to the trader for you I heard him tell one of the leftenants last night that he reckoned he d have to send to the States for a boy to help him take care on the store You see his last clerk growin tired of stayin here stole some money of his n and put for home Now mebbe you can work yourself into his place Leon s thanks were cut short by their arrival at the door of the trader s store He followed the wagon master in and was presented to a rough looking man who stood behind the counter A long conversation followed and when Leon was asked to tell his story he omitted nothing The trader scanned him closely and finally inquired Can you keep a set of books Yes sir replied Leon Either by single or double entry Now I don t want to hear no more about double entry exclaimed the trader growing red in the face and dashing his clenched hand upon the counter That s the way my last clerk kept my books and a nice mess he made of it He swindled me out of five hundred or a thousand dollars There s the books just as he left them added the trader waving his hand toward the desk and I can t make head nor tail of them Let me try said Leon Are you honest Well I ll tell you what I am willing to do I will come here on trial if you will take me and you can withhold my wages whatever they are If you see anything wrong about me you need not pay me a cent That s a fair proposition said the trader Hang up your overcoat somewhere and come around here Leon paused long enough to thank the kind hearted wagon master for the assistance he had rendered him and then taking his stand behind the desk set manfully to work to earn the money that was to pay his way back to the States That was all he had in his mind now His ambition to become a hunter was dead and buried out of sight All the rest of the day and until twelve o clock that night the trader and his new clerk stood at the desk trying to straighten out the accounts which Leon found to be in the greatest confusion And we may add that his mind was in great confusion too The sudden blighting of his long cherished hopes seemed to have stunned him and that strange malady homesickness from which Frank had suffered actually ever since leaving Albany assailed him with the greatest fury Frank had not given way to it for he had been buoyed up by the thought that if he could only secure his cousin s money he could at once turn his face toward Boston but Leon had absolutely nothing to encourage him While they were at work the trader casually remarked that he had paid his former clerk twenty dollars a month and board and when Leon thought of the long months he must spend in that dreary place before he could save enough to take him back to Eaton he felt like crying out in despair I can t stand it I can t stand it sobbed the repentant runaway as he tossed about on his hard bed in the little room off the store that had been occupied by his predecessor I shall die I know I shall Oh mother if I could only see you just one minute Leon s grief was so intense that he seemed to be on the point of suffocating He threw open the door of the room and walked the floor until he was almost exhausted but when he went to bed again he did not sleep and neither did he get up to open the store at six o clock as his employer had told him to do He was too ill to hold up his head The trader opened the store himself and after holding a few minutes conversation with his clerk walked across the parade ground and entered the doctor s office Returning to his store he found there a party of teamsters who were waiting for him While he was attending to their wants the hospital steward entered and went into Leon s room He stayed there about a quarter of an hour and when he came out the trader was alone What s the matter with that boy he asked Nostalgia and I suppose that is one of the worst things a poor mortal can be afflicted with replied the steward I have known it to throw every raw recruit in a battalion flat on his back Jerusalem cried the trader his face betraying the greatest consternation Is it as bad as that He did not understand the learned term which the steward had applied to Leon s malady but believing that a disease that bore a name like that must of necessity be something dreadful he was very badly frightened If there was any one thing of which he stood in the most abject fear it was contagion He had had some experience with it during his life among the Indians The steward who seemed somewhat surprised at the trader s words and actions replied Yes he is a pretty sick boy He has told me his story and I m going to speak to the doctor about him at once He ought to be shipped back to the States with as little delay as possible The steward went out and the trader paced up and down behind his counter in a state of mind bordering on frenzy If I ever befriend a vagabond again may I be shot said he He must be got out of here at once for I might catch it myself It is a pretty rough thing to do he added as he hurried toward Leon s door but self preservation is the first law of nature Say pilgrim he shouted as he entered the room where his clerk lay tossing and moaning on his bed you climb out o that and waltz Sir said Leon faintly Sir yelled the trader Get up and clear out Do you understand that Oh yes I understand it but what have I done I couldn t possibly get up I couldn t stand You must and you will roared the trader flourishing his fists in the air The steward says you ought to be kicked out of the fort directly and that shows you ve got something that s catching Now you get up and dust Start this minute or I ll take you by the collar and drag you out This threat put a little life and energy into Leon He arose to his feet and although he was so weak that he could scarcely maintain an upright position he succeeded in putting on his clothes Then he picked up his overcoat and staggered through the store and out at the door the trader shouting after him Now you go over to the other side of the fort and stay there Don t let me catch you on this part of the parade ground again Poor Leon All his hopes of seeing home and friends again were gone now CHAPTER XXVIII A FAMILIAR FACE Leon made the best of his way across the parade ground and threw himself helplessly down upon the steps of a warehouse He was so ill and so utterly discouraged that he almost wished he might die then and there and so bring his sufferings to an end He sat with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands looking the very picture of misery His gaze being directed toward the gate through which he had entered the day before he did not fail to see the neatly dressed young civilian who walked briskly up the hill and stopped to speak to the sentry At the sight of him Leon started up and even attempted to get upon his feet but he was so weak that he fell back upon the steps again I thought at first it was Oscar Preston said he He looks like him walks like him and dresses like him How much good the sight of one familiar face would do me I wish I was at Oscar s side this minute I tell you it wouldn t take me long to get home Corporal of the guard number seven shouted the sentry As Leon wearily raised his head he saw the corporal come out of the barracks in response to the call and hasten toward the gate He exchanged a few words with the visitor after which he conducted him along the path toward where Leon was sitting Again the boy raised his head his eyes opened to their widest extent his under jaw dropped downward he trembled in every limb He staggered to his feet winked hard to clear away something that seemed to be obstructing his vision and when he looked toward the visitor again he and the corporal were just disappearing through the door of the colonel s quarters That s Oscar Preston if I ever saw him panted Leon but what brought him out here Did my father send him after me No that can t be for he did not know where Frank and I were going Leon picked up his overcoat which was as heavy a load as he wanted to carry now and moving slowly along the path seated himself upon the threshold of the first door below the colonel s quarters intending to wait there until the visitor came out again He would have a good view of his face as he passed and then he would know whether or not he had been mistaken in regard to his identity At the end of half an hour it seemed an age to the impatient runaway a door opened in the commandant s quarters voices sounded in the hall and presently the visitor came out accompanied by the colonel the post surgeon and several subordinate officers They walked leisurely down the path conversing gayly and Leon s heart seemed to stop beating when he heard the colonel say Mr Preston when you write to the professor give him my kindest regards and assure him that I will do all in my power to assist you Hallo here he added in a very different tone of voice as a pale and trembling figure arose from a door step close at his side Who are you Leon could not reply He covered his face with his hands and tottered as if he were about to fall but Oscar for it was he who was struck motionless and dumb with astonishment recovered himself in time to spring forward and catch the runaway in his arms Leon Leon he exclaimed in a voice that was husky with emotion is this you Look up and speak to me But Leon s sobs effectually choked his utterance Supporting him with one arm Oscar forcibly drew away his hands and was amazed at the sight of the pale and sunken face which rested on his shoulder It is Leon as sure as the world cried Oscar who was almost beside himself with excitement Doctor this is a friend and schoolmate of mine and he is sick Won t you do something for him Did you call him Leon asked the surgeon stepping up and putting his hand under the boy s arm Then he must be that runaway my steward was telling me about Ah he added as Oscar nodded his head to him If that s the case you can do more for him than I can Leon was at once assisted into the surgeon s quarters and placed on a sofa The doctor felt his pulse while Oscar knelt beside him and rested his arm over Leon s shoulder as if to assure him of protection What s the matter with him sir he asked Oh I ve got something that s catching sobbed Leon and I m to be kicked out of the fort The trader told me so He wouldn t let me stay about where he was Oscar and the surgeon looked at each other in surprise and the latter said Why my young friend you re homesick There s nothing else the matter with you But that s bad enough said Leon who was nevertheless greatly encouraged I shall never see my home again Yes you will exclaimed Oscar You can start to morrow if you are strong enough to sit on a stage coach There said the surgeon That assurance will do him more good than all the medicine in the dispensary Sit down and talk to him he added handing Oscar a chair I ll give him a tonic and go out for half an hour He will be all right at the end of that time When the surgeon had seen Leon swallow the medicine he prepared for him he left the room and Oscar drew his chair up beside the sofa and sat down Leon pinched himself to make sure that he was not dreaming and then took Oscar s hand in his own and clung to it as if he were afraid that his friend might vanish into thin air Oscar said he I don t deserve this treatment at your hands Yes you do replied Oscar cheerfully I shall do all I can for you and then I shall not begin to cancel the debt I owe your father But you don t owe me anything but ill will It was I who shot Bugle I know it but you didn t hurt him You only made him angry Now drop that it is all forgotten and tell me what in the world brought you to the plains If I had met my own mother in the fort I certainly could not have been more surprised I came out to be a hunter confessed Leon You did So did I It was now Leon s turn to be astonished Yes sir continued Oscar I expect to make my living for years to come by hunting I am sent out here to procure specimens for the museum connected with the Yarmouth University Well sighed Leon after thinking a moment your way of becoming a hunter is better than mine Tell me your story from beginning to end said Oscar and then I ll tell you all about myself We know the story of Leon s adventures and mishaps so we will not repeat what he said to Oscar We know everything that happened to Oscar too up to the time he left Sam Hynes at his mother s gate on the night he returned from Yarmouth We dropped the thread of his narrative there and will now go back and take it up Oscar s mother you may be sure was overjoyed to see him The letters she had received from him during his absence had prepared her for a portion of the story he had to tell but there were also some things for which she was not prepared because the boy had had no time to write about them I was never so surprised in my life as I was this morning said Oscar after he had told of his reception and experience at the university The committee invited me into their room and gave me a check for sixteen hundred dollars There it is The thousand dollars I am to use in paying my expenses and the rest belongs to me I shall leave it all with you with the exception of a hundred dollars which I shall need to buy an outfit so you will be well provided for during my absence O Oscar exclaimed Mrs Preston I don t see how I can consent to this You will be so far away from home and among strangers But I shan t be among strangers either interrupted Oscar handing his mother a package of papers which he drew from the inside pocket of his coat There are my credentials my instructions which tell me just where to go and what to do and letters of introduction to high government officers both civil and military You see Professor Kendall he is the geologist you know has taken two parties of students out to the plains and during his excursions he made the acquaintance of these officers who gave him every assistance These letters will bring me the same aid and comfort The professor is going to take another party out there next summer and I am going to arrange matters so that they can camp with me for a few days The conversation was kept up until midnight and when Oscar went to bed he had the satisfaction of knowing that although his mother could hardly bear the thought of so long a separation she would adhere to her promise and throw no obstacles in his way He set about making preparations for the journey as soon as he arose the next morning and when Monday came he was all ready to start His friend Sam who went around looking as though he had lost everything on earth that was worth living for was with him night and day and accompanied him when he went to say good by to his friends Early on Monday morning the omnibus drew up before the door Oscar assisted the driver to carry out his trunk and then went back to take leave of his mother This was by no means an easy thing to do and when he came out he held his handkerchief to his face The only other passenger was Sam Hynes who did not speak to or even look at him although Oscar walked to the forward end of the vehicle where his friend was sitting and took a seat by his side He resolutely kept his back turned and looked steadily out of the window until they reached the depot then he jumped up wrung Oscar s hand for a moment and started for the door Say good by Sam and tell me that you wish me success cried Oscar But Sam did not act as though he heard him He dashed open the door and sprang to the ground and hurried away There was a large company of schoolboys assembled on the platform to see Oscar off and if he had stopped to shake all the hands that were stretched out to him he would have been obliged to wait for the next train He sprang upon the steps of the nearest car as the train was moving off waved his cap to the boys and looked around for Sam Hynes Presently he discovered that young gentleman far up the street striding along with his hands in his pockets and his chin resting on his breast Good luck to you Sam wherever you go and whatever you do said Oscar while a big lump of something seemed to be rising in his throat You re the best friend any fellow ever had Oscar stopped one day in St Louis to make a few purchases and then went on to Atchison where he took the stage for Julesburg He arrived there on time ate a hearty breakfast and leaving his luggage at the station walked up to the fort to present his letters of introduction to the commandant and surgeon The reception these gentlemen extended to him was all he could have desired They were astonished that a boy like himself should have been selected for so arduous and dangerous a mission but they entered heartily into the spirit of the matter and promised to assist him in every way We have seen that Oscar s arrival was most opportune Had he delayed his coming a few days longer there is no telling what would have become of Leon Parker Oscar spent the afternoon in writing long letters to his mother and Sam The one intended for Sam which was marked confidential contained a full history of Leon s adventures and wound up with the request that Sam for the sake of the friendship he bore the writer would take Leon under his protection Oscar hoped in this way to make things smooth for Leon There were mean boys in Eaton as there are everywhere but they would not be likely to say much to Leon about running away from home when they found he had a friend in such a heavy hitter as Sam Hynes was known to be The two boys took their meals with the officers mess and slept at the surgeon s quarters that night Leon s recovery was wonderfully rapid as the doctor said it would be but he was not yet himself by any means What would his father and his acquaintances in Eaton say to him when he reached home was the question that worried and haunted him continually Oscar said all he could to cheer him and the next morning he placed in his hands a sum of money sufficient to bear all his expenses and accompanied him to the station The coach arrived in time and the runaway after shaking Oscar warmly by the hand and thanking him over and over again for his kindness climbed to a seat on the top and in five minutes more was whirled away out of sight CHAPTER XXIX A VOICE FROM THE SNOW DRIFT It was a clear cold afternoon in February School had just been dismissed and among those who came down the stairs and paused to put on their gloves and pull the collars of their overcoats about their ears before venturing out into the frosty air were Sam Hynes and Leon Parker These two were often seen together now and we may add that the former had twice been kept after school since Leon came home and reprimanded for fighting But Sam declared that he had never had a fight in his life Perhaps he hadn t but it is nevertheless true that he had shaken one boy until every tooth in his head rattled and washed another s face in the snow It is hard to tell what Oscar would have thought if he had known how faithfully Sam was carrying out his wishes The two boys walked together until they arrived at Mrs Preston s house and there they separated one turning in at the gate and the other keeping on his way toward home Sam followed by Bugle who came out to meet him went into the woodshed and proceeded to fill his arms with stove wood This done he walked into the kitchen without ceremony and deposited the wood in the box Mrs Preston hearing the racket he made came out to see who was there Now Sammy said she I wish you wouldn t put yourself to so much trouble No trouble at all answered Sam I happened to pass through the woodshed and thought I wouldn t come in empty handed Heard anything from Oscar lately No I haven t and I begin to feel very uneasy No use feeling uneasy said Sam cheerfully They have had some hard storms out there and of course the roads are blocked When the letters do come they ll come in a bunch While Sam was speaking he was looking about the room and seeing that the water bucket was empty he went out and filled it at the pump Mrs Preston again protested but Sam silenced her by declaring that he happened to be thirsty and didn t know any easier way to get a drink It was a singular fact that somehow Sam always happened to pass through the woodshed about the time the box was empty and the kindling wood getting low and that he always happened to be thirsty when he came out of school and the water bucket had to be filled Mrs Preston had not lived alone since Oscar s departure She had two young lady boarders for company and as Sam had a way of dropping in and saying something cheerful just at the time when she was growing downhearted and longed to see Oscar she managed to keep up pretty good spirits Sam always brought sunshine with him and the lonely mother felt the better for his visits Having satisfied himself that there was nothing else he could do Sam departed with the remark that he might happen around to the post office that evening and if he did he would bring up Mrs Preston s mail should there chance to be any He went there as straight as he could go and to his great delight three letters addressed to Mrs Preston in Oscar s well known hand were pushed out to him With the muttered threat that if he did not find at least one letter for himself from the same source somebody would hear from him he walked to the other end of the office and looked into his father s box It happened that there were two for him and so Oscar escaped a blowing up One of the letters was bulky it took three stamps to bring it through and the other was much smaller I ll read the mean little one first thought Sam as he tore open the envelope after putting the other letters into his pocket and save the best for the last Sam took the letter out of the envelope and read it as he walked along that is he read a few lines near the end of it Then he stopped and stood motionless for a few moments looking the very picture of astonishment Suddenly arousing himself he crammed the letter back into the envelope jumped up and knocked his heels together at the same time uttering a suppressed whoop and started off at a rapid run The longer he ran the faster he ran and the consequence was that when he reached Mrs Preston s house he was nearly out of breath I ve got three letters for you he exclaimed as he burst into the sitting room There they are And you have run all the way from the office said Mrs Preston Yes m This cold weather makes one pretty lively Sam banged the door again and set off at the top of his speed He ran past his father s house and mounting the steps that led to Mr Chamberlain s door rang the bell furiously The summons was answered by the principal who looked at the boy in great surprise Oscar has gone and done it sure enough exclaimed Sam who was so full of news and so eager to communicate it that he couldn t wait to be questioned You remember the last evening but one that we spent with you do you not You asked Oscar if he would have the courage to hunt the savage animals we were talking about Well he has and he has proved himself a hero too I just got the letter out of the office and brought it around here thinking that perhaps you would like to hear it Certainly I would answered the principal It was very kind and thoughtful of you Sit down While Sam was talking he and the principal had been walking along the hall and now turned into the library The boy taking the seat pointed out to him slammed his cap down upon the floor drew Oscar s letter from his pocket and read as follows CAMP IN THE FOOT HILLS January DEAR SAM I wrote you a long letter last week I know you haven t received it yet for it is at this very moment lying snugly stowed away in one of the pockets of my saddle bags but I want to write just a few lines more for I have something to tell you I have but a very few minutes to tell it in because my guide is getting ready to make another attempt to reach the fort He tried a few days ago but the snow was so deep and soft that he was obliged to turn back before he had gone five miles He has made a pair of snow shoes since then and will travel on them until he strikes the prairie where he hopes to find the snow all blown off the trail I tell you Sam you don t know anything about storms or snow or drifts in Eaton You ought to be here now and I really wish you were for I hardly know what I shall do with myself while my guide is gone Of course I might hunt but I think I shall be safer in camp I saw something the other day and since then I have lost some of my enthusiasm The valley in which our camp is located is so effectually protected that there is very little snow in it and I have been able to go shooting every day I have secured a very fine pair of mule deer called black tails out here but although I have shot sixteen elk I have not yet found a specimen the horns not being as perfect as I wish they were I have stalked one old fellow who carries a magnificent pair of antlers more than a dozen times making use of all the caution and skill I was master of but he has always been too smart for me I have a rod in pickle for him however and in my next letter I shall tell you that I have got him But if I have failed in one thing I have been remarkably successful in another Give me a good grip and shake old fellow and then go and look at that skin hanging up there A black bear No sir You never saw one of that species with claws eight inches long It s a grizzly and my guide says he never in his life saw but one larger I killed him myself with a single bullet How I did it or how I had the courage to shoot at him at all I can t tell for the life of me It seems more like a dream than a reality He was close upon my guide who had wounded him and could not run fast enough to get out of his way and in a minute more there would have been sad work in that little grove of scrub oaks had it not been for my lucky snap shot which broke the bear s neck I don t hunt alone any more and now you know the reason why Sam not a word to mother about this While I shall keep you posted in everything I shall be careful what I write to her Don t mention it to anybody who will be likely to repeat it But my guide is ready and waiting I am going to see him a mile or two on his way and won t I be lonely when I come back to camp Remember me to all my friends in Eaton pat Bugle for me and believe me as ever Faithfully yours OSCAR PRESTON THE END THE FAMOUS CASTLEMON BOOKS BY HARRY CASTLEMON Illustration Specimen Cover of the Gunboat Series No author of the present day has become a greater

United States at The Country Life Press Garden City N Y SPAWN OF THE DESERT CONTENTS Chapter Page I II III IV V VI VII SPAWN OF THE DESERT I The Mohave Indians have a legend of the Calico Mountains and their origin According to their beliefs the Great Spirit finished the big task of making the world at this spot The desert was the final work of the Great Spirit and he was much pleased but in his arms he held a big jumble of rocks sand and pigments which were left from the great work The world was all made and very good to look upon so he had no place for this extra material To get rid of it he simply dropped it at his feet in a mass and the many hued pigments spilled over it until the whole was as a bright hued piece of cloth Thus according to the Indians was formed these mountains which are but a jumble of barren rocks rising sheer from the level desert scourged through the centuries by the desert sun wind and sand an unfading proof that unlike man the Great Spirit painted deeper than the surface But with all their gaudy colors in the sun these mountains at night are black silhouettes which appear to be without breadth or thickness or broken into misty hazy unreal piles in the moonlight On all sides the desert stretches away to the haze of nothingness a land of the mirage scenes which the jealous desert steals from arid lands and holds up to the eyes of desert men to lure them on Cities rivers lakes with cool nodding palms rippling brooks which seem only a few feet away then fade out to show a waste of dust gray mesquite which rattles in the hot winds Joshua trees with their agonized arms and sand Always the sand On a rocky plateau of this painted range stood a town one street of adobe shacks paved with the solid rock of the mountain Even the houses were tinted with fantastic colors where the clay had been mixed with the muck of the silver mines At the upper end of the street the cliffs arose sheer for several hundred feet like gaudy drapes of calico At the lower end was a succession of broken ledges which sloped off to the desert where the winding trails came in from the rest of the world To the left of the town was a deep rocky gorge so grotesque in formation that it did not appear to be a work of nature There were natural stone bridges caves barriers unreal in color and design as though a child minded giant had modeled them in colored clay and left them to harden in the blistering sun This was the residence section of Calico Town and was known as Sunshine Alley Just below where the Alley opened onto the desert on a slight rise of ground full in the glare of the sun and with no protection from the ever sifting sand was the graveyard which was known as Hell s Depot Not a blade of grass not even a spray of sage grew here The ground was a mass of small stones seemingly laid close together like tiles but showing patterns in colors that would put any man made mosaic to shame One foot deep was the limit of the graves as the rock below that depth was glass like flint but what the graves lacked in depth was made up in height The mounds of rock were piled until one might believe that the corpse had been of gigantic proportions or that the sexton wished to preclude any chance of the dead coming back in material form Such was Calico in the early fifties when men were gold and silver mad A town of thirty five hundred population a population which lived in caves hollowed places in Sunshine Alley or picked a corner in the rock and builded a rock barrier around them This gave a roofless dwelling but rain did not come to Calico so there was no need for roofs Water was worth more than whiskey and morals were as scarce as orchids Just now a funeral was in progress or rather had been in progress The corpse was there in the rough casket the grave was dug and the pall bearers stood aside reverently holding their hats in their hands Clustered around was a cosmopolitan mining camp audience Frock coated tall hatted gamblers rubbed elbows with muck stained miners Calico clad wives of miners children dogs and even a group of burros poked onto the flat to add their faces to the mournful proceedings Up the desert trail came two men and a lightly packed burro all of them gray with the dust and heat The one who led the caravan was a mighty weatherbeaten man with a long white beard In appearance he might have been a saint Surely he could not be a sinner with the eyes of a dreamer the nose of a prophet and the beard of a saint but nature does queer things to disappoint students of physiognomy The other man was also tall His face showed him to be about thirty years of age a face seemingly hewed from stone although handsome in its stern mold His hair was black and he wore it low between his cheek and ear There was the free easy swing to his walk like the half lope of a desert wolf The patriarch halted the caravan on the trail just short of the street end and gazed across at the funeral The younger man glanced over there with little show of interest Duke the old man jerked his head toward the graveyard I reckon they re plantin somebody Let s me and you go over They left their burro on the trail and crossed over attracting little attention The crowd seemed to be waiting for someone Two men were standing near the grave talking earnestly Suddenly one of them looked up and saw the newcomers He walked abruptly away from his companion and halted a few feet from the white bearded man Podner by yore whiskers yo re a preacher are yuh The bearded one s right hand came up and slowly stroked the white mass of hair which hung nearly to his waist line By my beard nodded the old man slowly which neither affirmed nor denied in fact but seemed to bring joy to the heart of his questioner who turned on his heel facing the crowd Folks we re playin in luck The funeral will proceed jist like nothin happened extraordinary Just a moment pardner said the bearded one What happens to be the matter Not a damn thing laughed the man We needed a preacher awful bad you showed up There yuh are Have you no preacher We did have Yessir we shore had a reg lar one and he was plumb tidy and slick on funerals yessir But he forgot himself complete like last night when he lowed there wasn t no honest rules of averages which gives him small cards all the time while Ace Ault get nothin smaller than kings up in ten deals Hm m m the white bearded one almost smiled Where is this poker playin preacher now Well hell s delight grunted the other He s in the casket We plumb forgot that he couldn t say his own oration That s where you comes in handy like a gun in a boot The patriarch s head turned slightly and his eyes flashed to the face of his companion who was regarding him with stony countenance although the eyes twitched slightly at the outer corners a sure sign that Duke Steele was greatly amused The bearded one crossed to the grave and looked down at the rough coffin while the audience moved in closer A burro brayed raucously and two more of the long eared beasts added their brazen throats to the racket A miner heaved a rock against the ribs of the nearest beast and the animal clattered away for a few jumps looking back solemnly sadly Friends the bearded man s voice was deep and musical as he lifted his bared head and let his eyes travel around the assemblage friends I have been asked to say a few words over the mortal remains of one of God s anointed a man who has labored in this land of sin and sinners that the Gospel might be brought home to you all He was fearless in his righteousness a guide friend and spiritual counselor He is with you no more except in spirit but his many good works will live long after his name has been forgotten I can see him now a bulwark of strength to the weak a solace to the suffering and a friend to all mankind I can see him Wait a moment parson interrupted the man who had asked the bearded one to deliver the sermon He stepped forward hat in hand clearing his throat apologetically I ain t no hand to stop a feller from sayin what he thinks but did you know Preacher Bill Bushnell The old man shook his head No I did not know him friend I didn t reckon yuh did parson We did I believe in sayin everythin good yuh can fer a dead man but there ain t no use of yuh lyin to us about Preacher Bill The old man glanced down at the coffin lifted his head slowly and nodded If the Lord is willing I will take back what I said about him and start all over again Wasn t he your minister Did he not labor among you He preached admitted a bearded miner seriously and added when he was sober enough He owed everybody in Calico and if he left any good works he sure had em cached where nobody ll ever find em The bearded man nodded slowly and cleared his throat Under those conditions friends I suppose I might as well keep away from personalities and stick to the ordinary burial service Has anyone a Bible The assemblage looked at each other and back at the bearded one Preacher Bill had one once stated a frock coated gambler I dunno what he done with it If you re a preacher where is your Bible The bearded one glanced quickly at the gambler and held out his hand Let me have a deck of cards will you Cards queried the gambler I have no cards Then you are no better heeled than I am partner I have no Bible you have no cards He leaned down and placed a hand on the rough casket Preacher Bill I wish I had known you well enough to have something to say about you No doubt you were a hard drinker of very little value to any community and showed poor judgment in objecting audibly against a run of bad poker luck but no man can live through childhood and well into life s narrow span without doing some good leaving somebody better for having known you Let him who is without sin cast the first stone Good by Preacher Bill The bearded man straightened up and looked at the crowd Friends I ask you to try and remember the good things he has done and forget the bad We are all children of circumstance The Bible says The son of man goeth as it is written of him Whether or not this means that our destiny is all written out in the good book I do not know Perhaps poor Preacher Bill merely traveled according to what had been written of him powerless to do otherwise Shall we say that he was unfit I think that is all I can say Parson one of the miners stepped out of the crowd and held out his hand to the old man if you start a church here I ll sure as hell go to hear yuh preach The old man smiled sadly shook hands with several of the miners and turned back to where Duke Steele stood They looked closely at each other turned and went back to their burro without a word while the mortal remains of Preacher Bill Bushnell were lowered one foot deep into Hell s Depot and piled high with heavy stones Le Saint said Duke Steele as they plodded toward the street I wonder what will be said over your remains The old man turned his head and glanced back toward the group at the cemetery I wonder Duke Perhaps I shall be lucky enough to have my funeral oration spoken by a man who did not know me any better than I knew Preacher Bill Will he say This is Paget Le Saint or will he say The Saint I wonder Still what should I care Duke Damn little difference it makes after a man s dead nodded Duke Steele True as Gospel Duke Life is the only thing that interests me death I know nothing about nor care And the Saint spoke truly when he said he did not care for the Saint was a fatalist a gambler who staked his life against other men s gold Just as surely as Kidd and Morgan were pirates of the seas the Saint was a pirate of the Desert whose appearance belied his calling Men seemed to speak softly in his presence as though awed by the majesty of his face and great white beard Oaths never passed his lips and no man had ever seen him take a drink of liquor He censured no man for doing evil and his open philosophy of life fitted in well with the rough lands of the West No man except Duke Steele knew the real business of the Saint and he knew only because they were of a kind Duke Steele was a gunman a killer a gambler and he alone knew that the Saint was all of these An old wolf in the raiment of a sheep as resourceful and dangerous as an old wolf and with the brain of a Solomon But no man not excepting Duke Steele knew anything more about the Saint than they had observed from contact with him for he confided in no man He had wandered much and at times would mention distant parts of the country Names seemed to interest him greatly names of men It was as though he was always searching for a certain name which he could only remember by hearing it spoken Duke Steele wondered at times if the Saint was not just a trifle insane For he was a strange personality at times given to brooding violence turning in a flash to extreme kindness and good humor He often spoke his own name as though mocking himself But of his ancestry his early life he made no mention Duke Steele had been one of his gang in a raid on the Cohise mines which had been skilfully planned and executed and without the loss of a man Three weeks before the Saint s outfit had boasted of twelve men Where the other ten were now could only be told by a bunch of Apaches who ambushed them beyond the Colorado The Saint and Duke Steele were the only ones to escape The plunder of the Cohise mining camp had been taken by the Indians and the Saint and Steele were forced to be content with saving their lives and one burro But Steele was an optimist and the Saint did not care for money It meant nothing to him Men believed him insane at times because of his total disregard for wealth He would nurse a sick man with all the tenderness of a woman or kill a malcontent with the cold bloodedness of a tiger But travel he must His eyes ever turned toward the hills as though he was wondering what was on the other side A prospector had told them of Calico and to Calico they had come with not a drop of water nor a crumb of food left The Lord must be looking out for us observed Duke Steele as they herded their burro up the main street Fate corrected the Saint The Lord has nothing to do with this place Duke It looks like the devil might have located it did one or two assessments and relinquished it on account of the heat A man crossed the street ahead of them and the Saint stopped him with the question Friend can you tell us where we may find lodging Lodging The man parroted the word There ain t a hotel in Calico Better see Sleed I reckon Since Preacher Bill got killed there s a vacant hole in Sunshine Alley and maybe yuh can rent it from Sleed And who is Sleed asked the Saint Who The man looked curiously at them Yuh must be strangers in this part of the country if yuh don t know who Sleed is He s the big man around here Owns the Silver Bar saloon over there and owns the California at Cactus City Owns the Lady Slipper and the Nola mines which are the biggest producers here Sleed was one of the original locators and he sure does own this town y betcha He owns the hole yuh spoke about queried Steele Yep owns most all of the Alley You just ask for Silver Sleed over at the Silver Bar saloon S funny yuh never heard of Silver Sleed No doubt nodded the Saint Our sources of information appear very lax in not apprising us of this great personage Still it is never too late to meet the great We both thank you friend The Saint turned the burro toward the front of the Silver Bar saloon while their informant shuffled his feet in the gravel street and wondered whether or not the old patriarch was making fun of him The Saint was not over fifty years of age but looked seventy Silver Sleed was a giant of a man with a great black beard which grew almost to his eyes eyes that reflected a greenish light like the sheen of jade He wore his hair long after the fashion of the time and his clothes were a trifle extreme but befitted his occupation and position as the richest and most powerful man in the country The law had never penetrated the Calico hills so Silver Sleed set himself up as judge and arbiter from which there was no appeal In all cases which did not directly or indirectly affect himself or his interests he was fair in his decisions The Silver Bar saloon was not a pretentious place being one story high built of adobe but it was the largest building in Calico The floor space was about forty feet wide by sixty feet deep which was taken up by a long bar gambling layouts and a dance floor It was the only saloon in Calico which was conclusive evidence that Sleed owned the town Calico spoke many languages but among this polyglot of tongues only one Louie Yen spoke Chinese Sleed did not like Chinese so he limited the camp to Louie Yen who was a velly good laundly yessum Louie was so old that he claimed to remember the time when Ruby Hill was nothing but a hole in the ground old and very wise after his own fashion But no man may rule a community without assistance Sleed surrounded himself with a few trusted men who were paid for doing certain things without asking the why and wherefore men who might be undesirable to a village of God fearing folk but passing unnoticed in Calico where according to the parlance of Sunshine Alley everything went except the cook stove and one joint of pipe Just now Sleed was standing with his back to the bar in the saloon his eyes squinted as though in deep thought Beside him stood a slender dark featured man dressed in the habiliments of the professional gambler His black eyes were sullen and shifty and his long fingers moved nervously at his sides as he flashed a sidewise glance at Sleed That s your idea of a square deal is it Sleed Sleed turned his head and looked coldly at the gambler Ace Ault this ain t no deal You killed Preacher Bill because well not because he said yuh dealt a crooked game but because yuh was jealous Jealous hell snapped Ault He said I know what he said interrupted Sleed coldly It gave yuh the chance yuh wanted Ault Preacher Bill was a dirty old bum and his tongue was against him but he was educatin Luck He was smart and he was learnin her a lot of things She liked him And because I protected my honor against his lying tongue I ve got to leave the camp eh queried Ault sarcastically Honor Sleed laughed into his beard Honor Good God when did a tinhorn like you get any honor Ault s face went a trifle darker and he lifted his hands to a level with his waist You travel muy pronto snapped Sleed Better go north Ault so yuh won t have any reason even to pass Calico town again Think so snapped Ault His right hand flashed up from under his coat From across the room came the jarring thud of a pistol shot and Ault jerked back firing his pistol a foot over Sleed s head For a moment Ault s eyes shifted around the room as he grasped at the bar for support half turned toward the door and fell sprawling One of Sleed s men came slowly across the room pistol in hand watching Ault closely Sleed s expression had not changed Quick work Loper he said softly Loper nodded and shoved his gun back into its holster Just then the Saint and Duke Steele came into the door Sleed looked at them indifferently and motioned for some more men to assist in carrying Ault s body out of the place The Saint and Steele stood aside and watched the men file out Silver Sleed asked Steele Sleed looked at him for a moment glanced toward the door as he nodded Some of the men who had been at the graveyard were coming in looking curiously back at the men carrying Ace Ault We re lookin for a place to live in said Steele A man told us to see Silver Sleed Yeah Sleed squinted at the Saint and back to Steele Whatcha goin to do in Calico You didn t expect an answer to that did yuh asked Steele with a smile Sleed grunted softly One of the men from the graveyard stepped in and spoke to Sleed The graybeard s a preacher Sleed He said a few things for Preacher Bill and they was damn well said after he got put right Sleed looked at the Saint curiously and found the Saint looking straight at him Something in that glance seemed to bother Sleed It was as though this tall white bearded hawk eyed man was peering into things that Sleed did not want anyone to see Sleed glanced down at the floor for a moment and nodded I reckon there s places to live in Yuh can have Preacher Bill s place or yuh can have Sleed looked up and glanced toward the door I think yuh can have the place where Ace Ault lived We both thank you sir The Saint s voice boomed like the deep notes of a pipe organ Sleed glanced quickly at him and saw that the Saint s eyes were closed as though he had shut out material things while he thought deeply I ll show em the places Sleed It was the miner who had offered to come to church in case the Saint would do the preaching Sleed nodded and turned back to the bar but he watched the three men go out of the door Loper who are them two men he asked I dunno Loper shook his head Find out Sleed turned back to the bar and called for whiskey For some unknown reason he was worried The killing of Ault amounted to nothing He discarded that as a possible reason for his unrest Was it the white bearded man Sleed scowled at his glass of liquor for a moment and placed it back on the bar untasted II The Saint and Steele found that there was little choice between the two dwellings but they selected the one made vacant by the death of Preacher Bill It was a roofless windowless rock hut about ten feet square built in an angle of the canyon which supplied two of the walls An open fireplace was used for cooking and the utensils were either placed on rock shelves or on the ground Preacher Bill s blankets were still spread from his last night s sleep but the larder was empty I reckon yuh can get along said their guide I m Jim Cates but most everybody calls me Mica S I said before if yuh start preachin I m goin t have a front seat He started away but turned back Say if yuh get a call to speak over the remains of Ace Ault I can tell yuh a few things to make yore oration easier Ault was crooked as a snake in a cactus patch He never Mica Cates stopped talking and cleared his throat A girl had come up near the doorway and was looking at them She was about twenty years of age fairly well dressed A pair of big brown eyes misty with tears looked at them from a cameo like face which was framed in a mass of brown hair Her cheeks were streaked with tear marks and her lips quivered as she looked around Then she turned without a word and disappeared around the canyon wall Sleed s daughter said Cates softly Her name is Nola but Sleed said she was his luck so many times that everybody calls her Luck Been cryin said Steele wonderingly Uh huh Mebbe yuh didn t see her down to Hell s Depot She was there I reckon she was the only one to care about Preacher Bill Yuh see she ain t had no chance to learn book teachin s until Preacher Bill took to learnin her He was eddicated a lot and she sure wanted to learn Steele nodded She s a mighty pretty girl Cates And nother thing said Cates softly yuh don t want to have nothin t do with her Sleed s a killer where Luck s concerned Mebbe that s one reason why Ault got a ticket for the Depot Jist let her alone and don t cross Silver Sleed and you ll git along here What did yuh say yore names was The Saint held out his hand and Cates shook hands with him flinching from the crushing grip of the Saint s hand We both thank you Mica Cates boomed the Saint If I preach in Calico town I shall deem it a pleasure to see you in the front row Mica Cates bobbed his head and hurried away He flexed his right hand and shook his head My Gawd I never knowed a preacher with a grip like that nossir I didn t find out their names and I m danged if I d ever ask any man twice Cates climbed back up the rocky trail to the street where he met Loper Where did they hole up asked Loper Preacher Bill s place Ask em their names Mica Y betcha I did What names did they give yuh Mica Cates glanced back down the trail wiped the perspiration off his brow with the back of his hand They ain t givin away names I reckon Yuh asked em didn t yuh snapped Loper angrily Y betcha I did Mebbe they didn t hear me I dunno Loper hitched up his belt and strode back to the street It was very hot and he had no desire to climb down into Sunshine Alley and argue about names III We ve got a home said Duke Steele dubiously as he leaned against the rough stone doorway squinting in the reflected light from the desert sun but when we got there the cupboard was bare Yes nodded the Saint but how long have we fasted Duke Since breakfast He pointed at the hills above them dotted with tunnels where a host of men drove into the bowels of the earth Came the dull jar of blasting the rattle of falling rock from the ever growing dumps Men are toiling up there Duke while down on the street another group of non toilers are planning to get the fruits of that labor without toil You and I do not toil therefore we must use our brains to devise ways and means to get the necessary provender Just about how queried Duke The Saint unrolled some of his meager belongings on the stone floor and in the center of it all was a small package The Saint picked this up and got to his feet Duke it has been seldom that I have had to stoop to their use but when I am forced to such an extremity they never fail Meaning what smiled Duke The Saint unrolled the small package and held in his hand two halves of a walnut empty of all meat and polished to a mahogany finish In one of the halves was a polished black object about the size of a garden pea The tools of a cheap gambler said the Saint studying Duke s dubious expression Yet one must be dexterous and have the courage of his calling Where does the game come in asked Duke The Saint knelt down on a blanket smoothed it out and placed the two shells open side down He slipped the black pea under one of the shells and with a rapid twist of his hand and fingers shuffled the shells for a moment Which one is it under Duke he asked Duke indicated the one and the Saint lifted the shell There was no pea under it The Saint repeated the process slower this time and Duke Steele was willing to bet his neck on picking the right shell but he was mistaken Is it under the other shell Saint he asked That is hardly a fair question Duke Just supposing I had opened my game and a bettor had picked the other shell Would it be good policy to have the pea under that shell In our financial condition we cannot afford to take any great chances and I know of no smaller chances of losing than by operating the two little walnut shells Duke nodded shortly I reckon that s right Saint Looks to me like Sleed has this place under his thumb I suppose he s got every gunman working for him which makes it a poor place for us The Saint placed the two shells in his pocket and came to the doorway The setting sun slanted against the expanse of Ruby Hill bringing out a myriad of colors until the whole land seemed to be a vast drop curtain of fantastic shades The voices of men drifted down to them as clear cut as the tinkling of bells The rasp of a pick the clank of hammer on steel seemed to come from the air above them and at no great distance And like the dimming of a great light the sun moved its rays swiftly up the side of the mountain leaving in its track a misty softness almost as blue as moonlight Blast after blast seemed to jar the world as the last shots of the afternoon were fired A few moments later like ants coming from their burrows the men came from their tunnels and down the steep hillside while from Sunshine Alley the supper fires sent up long straight streamers of smoke to signal them home Men will always toil said the Saint as though talking to himself Toil day after day until their span of life is done and after them their sons will take up the toil and carry it on And what does it all mean Will the work that these men are doing amount to anything in the final scheme of things Will the sweat of their brows and the callouses on their hands mean anything Is there a reason for things I wonder Duke He turned and put his hand on Steele s shoulder I have no conscience no morals I have killed like the wolf kills and yet I have no fear of death only wonder I have studied men from the frozen North to the tropics I know their different breeds languages customs I have seen a Cree chief die and I have seen the passing of a Yaqui brave I have seen the mystery of the unknown come into the eyes of a learned man and I have held the wrist of a dying degenerate They all die alike Duke Never have I seen a man who did not fight against the death and I have never seen one pass into the borderland with a smile of welcome Always that mystery Sometimes I wonder if death is a punishment The fear of death is punishment to most men no matter who they are A minister of the Gospel fights against the hand of death as strongly as the worst sinner ever bred and why The hereafter is a mystery life is just as great a mystery Duke nodded solemnly I reckon you re right Saint I kinda feel sorry for Sleed s girl The Saint looked down at the rocky floor and smiled in his great beard Life is no mystery to youth and you are only thirty years of age Duke But don t feel sorry for Sleed s girl In the first place she is Sleed s girl in the second place you are Duke Steele Duke swung away from the doorway and looked up the hill toward the town He turned and looked at the Saint I I reckon you re right Saint I kinda forgot IV It can t be beat friends The more you put down the less you take up Never buck another man s game because it was not invented to lose money for its owner The gent bets five that he can pick the right shell One at a time gents This is a one man game unless you both want to bet on the same shell Empty again gents Where s the next man who is foolish enough to think he can beat a sure thing game The Saint s voice boomed softly as he pocketed the bet and slowly moved the two walnut shells The yellow light from the Silver Bar windows lit up his white hair and white beard as he lifted himself to his full height and studied the crowd in the street The Saint had secured a small rough table which he had placed in the street using the lights from the saloon to illuminate his game A big moon peeping over Ruby Hill lit up the street in a soft blue haze broken by the blocky shadows of the rough buildings and shot here and there by the yellow lights from oil lamp or candle The narrow street was thronged with people for Sunshine Alley moved to the main street at night Money was plentiful and the toilers threw it away living only in the present The shell game was new to Calico and Calico was anxious to welcome something new Men jostled each other for a chance to place a bet while the Saint s voice boomed a warning to each and all It can t be beat brother The hand is quicker than the eye Another empty shell Don t nobody ever win asked a miner Nobody brother Again I say to you all it can t be beaten The crowd laughed It was unusual for a game keeper to declare that no one can beat his game The Saint was deadly serious and this amused the crowd Another man who had watched several bets swept from the table moved in and tossed several gold pieces beside the shells Pick up your money friend urged the Saint You can t win Might as well toss your money into the dust and walk away from it All right if you insist Thank you for the present The man turned away and went toward the saloon door Duke Steele had been watching the game and now he moved in closer to the Saint who dug into his pocket and handed Duke a fistful of money Take a spin at the wheel son I don t want to take all of Silver Sleed s business away from him I reckon Sleed can stand it better than we can laughed a miner who had donated liberally to the elusive black pea Duke moved out of the crowd and started for the saloon door when he came face to face with Sleed s Luck The girl was standing on the raised step of the saloon watching the crowd around the Saint but now she looked straight at Duke who removed his sombrero slowly He wanted to speak to her but turned and started on into the Silver Bar realizing that he had never met her Wait she said softly and he stopped Loper came out of the door and walked to the edge of the steps looking toward the crowd in the street You wanted to speak to me asked Duke Yes I want to speak to you about him She motioned toward the Saint as she spoke My pardner queried Duke Yes I I heard him at the graveyard today Is he a preacher He can preach said Duke slowly He has been educated said the girl as though talking to herself He must know a lot of things Yes m he sure does nodded Duke and might have added that the Saint would have been hanged many times for divulging even a part of what he knew I wonder if I could talk to him she said quickly Not tonight tomorrow maybe Yes m I reckon yuh could We re livin where Preacher Bill used to live Luck nodded I saw you there Preacher Bill was my friend What is his name She motioned toward the Saint Le Saint Le Saint she said softly I thought of him that way when I saw him at the graveyard My father let Preacher Bill teach me things and I wonder my father is down at Cactus City tonight You ve lived here a long time asked Duke Two years Mighty long time to live here observed Duke Luck nodded slowly A long time yes Nothing but heat in the day and this She gave a weary gesture toward the street at night I have lived in the North where the mountains are big and cool where there are big trees and rivers It is never cool here At times it is a dreary cold then the heat Duke nodded and looked up at the moon hanging like a great ball only a short distance above the hill Suddenly an altercation started across the street beyond the crowd around the Saint A babble of voices a curse shrilled in a woman s voice a shot Duke turned quickly to Luck but she had disappeared in the crowd A man elbowed his way across the street laughing as he reached the door and spoke to Loper Woman fer a change Loper Tejon Mary tried to knife a feller but he was lookin fer it and shot her S time somebody stopped her grunted Loper She was loco Sleed was goin t ship her out anyway The crowd around the shell game began to scatter and look for another diversion Duke went out to the Saint whose pockets were bulging with money Game is closed said the Saint putting the shells in his pocket and picking up the table and again we have a stake He placed the table in the alleyway between the Silver Bar and the adjoining building I was surprised not to have Silver Sleed try to stop my game said the Saint as he joined Duke He s in Cactus City tonight Saint I had a talk with his daughter Sleed s Luck Yeah Son it is none of my business began the Saint but Duke stopped him and the Saint listened closely while Duke told him what the girl had said He shook his white beard slowly when Duke finished I reckon said Duke slowly I reckon you ve just about got to start in where Preacher Bill left off Tomorrow mused the Saint Tonight I would refuse to consider it tomorrow is another day A man is a fool to declare his intentions more than one minute into the future Let us procure food Duke Steele after that we will sleep It has been a long day From within the saloon came the squeak of a fiddle the tinpanny rattle of a piano the scrape of boots The dance had begun Several men were going down the street carrying a blanketed figure which had been Tejon Mary who was loco From far out in the barren hills a coyote yapped dismally Sleed came back from Cactus City the next day came back like a sore headed grizzly looking for trouble He had drunk heavily played poker all night and the heat of the day had ground his temper to a razor edge Men kept away from Silver Sleed when he was in this humor but he soon heard of the shell game which had held the attention of the crowd the night before and his face purpled with rage He cursed everyone in sight and sent for Loper who was almost as sore headed as his master Sleed took him to the rear of the room sat him down at a table and demanded an explanation How could I stop him demanded Loper I ain t Sleed The crowd liked his game cause he told em all that it can t be beat How much did he win growled Sleed I dunno Prob ly about two hundred dollars Tejon Mary got shot and that kinda busted up the crowd Sleed leaned back and licked the edge of a frayed cigar while he waited for Loper to explain more I seen Luck talkin to the other fellow Sleed snapped the cigar aside and leaned across the table Luck was talkin to this old man s pardner Yeah What about I dunno all they talked about Sleed I didn t want to move in too close but I know she was askin him about the old man About the old man parroted Sleed What did she want to know about him I dunno You dunno mimicked Sleed Is there anythin you do know Wasn t your ears workin I told yuh I didn t want to move in close Sleed I heard some of it and Oh you heard some of it did yuh Sleed got ponderously to his feet and leaned both hands on the table as he snarled down at Loper You heard some of it but you don t know what they talked about Loper licked his lips and wished that the interview was over Luck asked him what the old man s name was and What was it snapped Sleed Le Saint Silver Sleed stared down at Loper stared curiously vacantly He lifted one hand and brushed it across his lips while his fixed gaze seemed to look through Loper and beyond Loper shifted nervously but Sleed continued to stare Suddenly he jerked like a man awaking from sleep and sat down slowly in a chair Le Saint he muttered softly Funny first name said Loper slowly Paget I think he called it Must be a furriner Silver Sleed did not seem to hear him I dunno what the other feller s name is but he sure looks like he could take care of himself Packs a gun that looks like it had been used a plenty and he s got the walk of a cat The old man s gun ain t no ornyment either Mebbe he s a preacher I dunno Sleed continued to stare at the table top Want me to pack a talk to him asked Loper I can tell him to put out of here or that he can t run no game in Calico No Sleed shook his head slowly and leaned closer to Loper Do yuh know anythin about that shell game Only that it can t be beat Of course it can t admitted Sleed hoarsely That pea ain t under either shell Suppose that you bet a lot of money on the pea bein under one of them shells and it wasn t there and yuh grabbed the other one and found it empty Sleed grinned wolfishly What would yuh do Loper That s it eh grunted Loper I reckon I d take my money back Which might start trouble Thasall right grunted Loper I d be lookin for trouble Sleed got to his feet and jerked his head toward the bar as an invitation to have a drink Let this man set up his game tonight if he wants to I reckon you know what to do Loper Loper nodded Uh huh But have somebody watchin this other feller Sleed he s dangerous y betcha Some of the boys will take care of him Maybe I ll watch him myself Sleed spilled his liquor in the pouring but filled his glass to the brim while Loper wondered what had happened to Steed s iron nerve He wondered if his boss were losing his nerve or if it were only the effects of too much liquor and loss of sleep Got any more orders for today asked Loper Sleed shook his head splashing the liquor from his glass into his beard Then he tossed the half empty glass over the bar and walked out of the door Guess that whisky don t set well on his stummick today observed the bartender kicking the broken glass aside Somethin don t admitted Loper seriously He s drinkin too much I reckon You better mention it to him grinned Loper He s in good shape for a temp rance lecture right now F he ever gets snakes It ll be hell on the snakes finished Loper V Long strings of mules driven with a jerk line and hauling heavy clumsy ore wagons drifted out of Sunshine Alley hauling great loads of silver ore to the mills at Cactus City fifteen miles away It was a hard journey across the desert to Cactus City but water was necessary for the handling of the ore and Calico had none Many of the wagons brought back great casks of water to supply Calico There was no ice The cool of the evening lowered the temperature of the water a trifle but a cold drink was unknown in Calico town in summer Duke Steele and the Saint had stocked their larder from one of the stores and had secured several badly needed blankets A passing wagon had sold them a small cask of water at a large price but they were willing to pay The burro had joined forces with several more of its kind which were trying to eke out a living in the Alley by devouring anything and everything from an old newspaper to a much boiled bone At times as though by signal they would all bray together their raucous voices echoing brazenly from the cliffs Mica Cates came down the road and stopped at sight of Duke and the Saint They took Ault and Tejon Mary to Cactus City he announced Ault had some friends in Cactus and Sleed didn t want Mary buried here Cates laughed and added Mebbe Sleed was afraid Mary s ghost might not be welcome among so many good ones Is Cactus City any better than Calico asked Duke Better morals nodded Mica They don t have a killin down there more n once a week You stay here and you ll find a plenty of funerals to work on Ain t no money in it as far as I can see but Preacher Bill had a system He orated at funerals fer nothin quite a while and one day he whittled out a cross and fastened it to a headstone She looked kinda pious A gambler who was religious as hell saw him put up this here cross so the gambler takes up a collection fer old Bill I reckon he got a hundred dollars fer him and after that old Bill packs a cross with him all the time and hopes for a killin Cates grinned and went on up the road He was like a daily paper to Calico and spent most of his time retailing news picking up new items at each stop and telling hearsay as personal experience Duke Steele turned from watching Cates and saw Luck coming slowly down the trail toward their adobe The Saint glanced up at the girl and back at Duke who was smiling at her She came shyly up to them and Duke introduced her to the Saint She was even prettier in the harsh light of day than in the dim lights of the night before I I wanted to talk to you she faltered looking at the Saint She traced a pattern with her toe in the sand and seemed undecided just what else to say I think I understand nodded the Saint You want to learn and you think I am capable of teaching you Is that it Yes eagerly Preacher Bill taught me some But he s gone now and I I wondered He wasn t a good man like you but he wanted to help me You see I have never been to a regular school The Saint turned his head slowly and looked at Duke Steele Somehow it did not seem funny to them The Saint turned back to her and said And why do you think I am better than Preacher Bill I don t know she admitted softly I don t know how I know you are but I do Preacher Bill had a Bible with pictures in it and you look like one of them Preacher Bill said it was the picture of a saint The Saint lifted his head and stared up the Alley shutting his eyes against the glare of the reflected light while the girl watched him eagerly He turned and looked at her Why don t your father send you where there are schools He can afford it Luck shook her head Preacher Bill wanted him to send me away but he only laughs and says he can t afford to lose his luck He says I bring him luck I guess he believes this He talks about it so much that nobody ever calls me Nola any more Where is your mother child asked the Saint Luck shook her head I don t know Dad never talks about her and when I ask him he gets angry I don t remember her I remember that we lived in the North where it gets cold and where there are big mountains Since then we have traveled all over the country Dad and I You ain t had much of life that s a cinch muttered Duke Feller hadn t ought to drag a girl over the country like that Bad enough for a boy Luck shut her lips tightly for a moment and then I guess I can stand it Dad says he is going to get me some books Ace Ault wanted to get me some but Dad put a damper on that idea Dad didn t like Ace Perhaps your dad won t like me suggested the Saint Well Luck hesitated a moment I ll tell him about you and will you teach me if he don t mind The Saint looked quizzically at her and his eyes shifted to a far away look as though he were undecided Then he nodded Yes child if he don t mind Luck turned quickly and ran up the trail as though she was going to lose no time in finding out Duke smiled after her and looked at the Saint who was staring down at the ground his hands clenched at his sides The face of a saint was gone now and in its stead was the grinning snarl of an old wolf He lifted his face and looked at Duke Steele who was staring at the change in the old man s face and manner Duke Steele the Saint s voice was thin almost a whine I ve lived to kill kill do you hear me Now I ve promised God why did I He swung his head as though in pain and walked away Duke watched him going slowly down the road his shoulders hunched as though the weight of the world rested on his back Whom did he live to kill Why did his promise to Luck change his whole being Duke frowned and tried to gather some reason for the old man s feelings but in vain The Saint left the road and climbed the hill to a pinnacle of rock where he sat and stared down the canyon chin in hands like a great white headed eagle watching for its prey It was an hour later that the Saint came back He seemed older whiter and very tired Duke made no mention of what had passed between them and the Saint did not open the subject He sat down in the doorway and examined his revolver an old single action Colt scarred and polished from much usage His long lean fingers seemed to caress the old gun lovingly There were no notches on the butt of this old gun but Duke Steele knew that its muzzle had spouted death many times Suddenly Duke spoke Saint what made you old before your time Old Before my time The Saint turned his head and looked at Duke Uh huh You ain t over fifty are yuh You ain t got no right to wear long white hair and whiskers and make folks think you re as old as the hills The Saint ran his hand under his beard and lifted it in range of his eyes For several moments he peered at it as though he had never seen it before Duke what would I look like without this beard I ain t got the slightest idea Saint It sure does cover your face and head And that said Saint slowly is your answer son VI Luck found her father at home asleep but her news was of such importance that she awoke him He snarled an answer to her call before he realized who had called him I ve got a new teacher she announced when she had recovered from the effects of his snarling answer Teacher eh Who The old man with the white beard Le Saint Le Sleed sat up on the bed and stared at her Luck nodded Le Saint He looks like one of the old men in the Bible He is going to teach me if you will let him Sleed stared down at the floor with unseeing eyes while Luck s words seemed to run in a meaningless jumble through his mind We need a preacher here said Luck softly and he is very good and kind Will you let him teach me Daddy Sleed roused from his stupor and got heavily to his feet Don t you feel good asked Luck Your face is so white and your eyes No I m all right grunted Sleed thickly I I lost a lot of sleep and this blasted heat He wiped his brow with the sleeve of his shirt Are we going to live here always asked Luck Always Sleed tried to smile Always is a long time Luck Sleed picked up his hat and started for the door but Luck took him by the arm You did not say about my teacher Sleed did not look at her as he said When is he goin to start teachin Luck Tomorrow eagerly Oh tomorrow I reckon that ll be all right tomorrow Sleed went out of the door and Luck watched him go down the rocky trail to the street but he did not turn and wave at her as he usually did Suddenly he stopped turned and came slowly back up the trail to the doorway Luck I wish you d stay off the street tonight he said Why she asked It was the first time he had ever requested her to keep away from the street I m afraid yuh might get hurt There s a bunch comin up from Cactus City tonight and they might get rough I can t afford to have anything happen to my Luck They all know me said Luck quickly Nothing will harm me Sleed shook his head I I dunno about that Luck If trouble started nobody knows where bullets will hit Luck brushed the hair away from her eyes and glanced down toward the quiet street Everybody says that you own Calico Dad If you do why don t you stop the trouble Does there have to be somebody killed every day Isn t there some way to stop men from fighting and killing each other Silver Sleed shook his head No I don t reckon there is not now Maybe some day the wolf blood will thin out I dunno And without gaining Luck s promise to keep off the street that night Sleed turned and went back down the trail Luck watched him disappear and turned to see Mica Cates coming down past the house on his way from the Ruby Hill trail He took off his hat and mopped his brow Howdy Miss Luck Hot ain t it I been circ latin around quite a bit Wes Marks jist run into a two inch vein of durned near pure silver Could almost mint dollars out of the raw stuff Two miners from the Nola had a devil of a fight and one s got a busted head Didja notice how many buzzards has been floatin around t day Been a whole flock of em circlin Calico fer two hours That old white bearded hombre was settin on a rock fer a long time like he was thinkin a heap and then I seen him oilin his six gun Mebbe he s a preacher I dunno Mica Cates stopped for breath and glanced up at the sky where a flock of buzzards circled slowly and without visible effort Cates lowered his eyes and glanced at Luck S hard to fool a buzzard he said and went on down the trail He had fulfilled his duty and added a prophecy to boot Luck s eyes followed the buzzards for a while as they circled slowly on an even plane as though suspended by invisible wires and went back into the house There was something ominous in the atmosphere and Luck had not given her word to keep off the street Loper had passed the word to Bill Fane and Pecos Mendez as to what Silver Sleed expected and the three of them met in the Silver Bar saloon Fane was a tall cadaverous person with a crooked mouth which gave him a perpetual leer Mendez was a half breed whose mentality was hardly up to par but whose pistol ability and cold blooded nerve were seldom equaled We tak care of de yong man eh queried Mendez his voice like the purring of a cat Dat be easy eh Beel Fane nodded absently No killin is easy objected Loper This young man packs a gun like he knowed how to use it and he s got a face that backs up the looks of his gun You two better figure that this ain t goin t be no picnic What does Sleed want em killed fer asked Fane Cause he don t low nobody to cut in on his gamblin in Calico replied Loper He ain t never told em they can t run a game here has he That s none of your business nor mine said Loper Silver Sleed pays yuh don t he Yeah admitted Fane slowly he pays But I m gittin tired of bein hired to shoot folks I ain t no danged milk eater Loper but I believe in lettin a man have a even break You better not let Sleed hear yuh talk thataway cautioned Loper He ain t got no use for that kind of arguments Fane grinned crookedly and put his hand on Loper s arm Loper who are we to let Silver Sleed hire us to do his dirty work Why are we afraid of him What did he ever do to make us afraid of him Either one of us could bump him off with a gun Are we afraid of his damn money I got to lookin him over today and wonderin why we re afraid to speak out loud about him You tell me not to let him hear me talk thataway Why should I be any more afraid to let him hear it than you and Mendez Loper drew away from Fane but the question had found root in his brain Money said Mendez Just money I jus so good as Sleed but Sleed has de money Man got to live I reckon that s it nodded Loper I never thought much about it before Bill I reckon any of us could more than hold his own against Sleed in a gun fight but he s got the money Anyway I told him we d take care of this for him The three of them strolled to the doorway Far out on the desert was a strip of gold marking the last of the sunset but Calico was already hazy with the evening light The Saint and Duke Steele came out of the Alley and into the street walking slowly toward the Silver Bar saloon Them is the ones grunted Loper I dunno what Sleed wants done in case they don t open that game He s doin this cause he wants to stop em from gamblin ain t he queried Fane Loper nodded Mica Cates came thumping down the street and up to the saloon door where he turned and looked up at the sky He shaded his eyes for a moment and turned to the three men Did yuh notice how the buzzards been hangin around here all day What s that got to do with us grunted Loper I dunno admitted Cates I never said who it concerned They ve circled Calico all day and sometimes they come down awful low with their wattled heads turnin from side to side kinda lookin Cates shook his head and started into the saloon but stopped and glanced at the sky again S hard to fool a buzzard y betcha Croakin old pup growled Loper and the three of them went back into the saloon The Saint secured his little table again and set it up in the street Several dogs went out and investigated and started a fight as though there was a serious difference of opinion over the reasons for a table in the street Duke Steele watched the Saint with misgivings He was sure that Silver Sleed would object strenuously to such a proceeding but the Saint gave no heed to his warnings For the last hour the Saint had seemed another person entirely different from the philosophical old man His mop of white hair seemed to lift aggressively and the hawk like nose seemed more like an eagle s beak He had put his extra cartridges in his pocket and shoved his six shooter inside the waistband of his pants where he could get it without reaching under his coat Duke had noted these preparations silently but had looked to his own gun and ammunition He was willing to follow the Saint s lead and he wanted to be prepared for anything Duke went into the saloon and sat down at a poker table where Sleed was dealing a game of stud Sleed studied Duke from under the brim of his hat as he slid a stack of chips across the table to him The limit queried Duke The sky replied Sleed The Saint had split his winnings with Duke and now Duke shoved the rest of the bills over to Sleed taking chips in exchange It was a small betting game and the pots were uninteresting Sleed covered a yawn with his hand and Duke nodded as though at a spoken word Duke smiled grimly as Sleed dealt the first card to each man He shoved in part of a stack of chips and Sleed covered the bet wondering why Duke made such a bet on a hole card The two miners passed leaving Sleed and Duke to fight it out Duke drew a king and Sleed a jack King high bets intoned Sleed Duke shoved in all of his chips Sleed glanced sharply at him but covered the bet and dealt the rest of the hand The result showed a pair of kings for Duke and a pair of jacks for Sleed The next deal doubled Duke s money again and he bet half of it on his hole card Again he won Sleed shifted nervously in his chair while miners crowded in around to watch the play Sleed knew that there was no chance for a crooked play and he trusted to luck to win Pot after pot went to Duke Steele doubling his money on each hand until the onlookers gasped at the wonderful run of luck Duke was plunging betting a fortune on his first card And Sleed s prestige in the town demanded that he follow suit although it broke him Sleed called for another rack of chips new cards whiskey praying that something would happen to break the devilish luck of this hard eyed gambler Another deal and Duke bet two thousand dollars on his first card Sleed glanced at the bet and doubled the size of it Feel it comin on queried Duke It was the first word Duke had spoken since he had inquired about the limit Sleed s eyes narrowed at the question but he did not reply Duke shoved in the extra two thousand and with it went every chip in front of him Stacks of blue and red at five and ten dollars for each chip a king s ransom Sleed licked his lips and studied the pot Your luck or mine said Duke softly You re rich Sleed but are yuh game It s a man sized pot From out on the street came the voice of the Saint It can t be beat folks The more you lay down the less you pick up The hand is quicker than the eye and this game was designed to prove it to you Don t bet unless you want to lose Duke watched Sleed closely as he stared down at the pot It s luck that wins Sleed and you re losin your luck What do you mean snapped Sleed sitting up straight in his chair What do you mean She s leavin you Sleed You know it too Shove in your money and prove it with the cards It s luck now I ll show you my card Duke flipped his hole card disclosing a deuce of hearts The little thin card Sleed Your card must be as good as mine but my luck my medicine is stronger than yours Your luck has left you Like hell it has croaked Sleed and turned his card the ace of spades face up on the table Nervously he shoved in chips calling for another rack to match Duke s bet Deal em face up said Duke softly Give the crowd a little entertainment Sleed Another empty shell came the Saint s voice This is not a luck game folks it is a cinch for the dealer Sleed s hand shook as he started to deal Duke got an ace while Sleed s card showed the five of hearts Slowly the next two fell to the table a five of clubs to Duke and the deuce of diamonds to Sleed Ace five deuce said Duke softly Luck is laughing at you Sleed Sleed tossed the next two and the crowd gasped Each man drew a king Matched cards said Duke laughing softly One more card Sleed one more This one proves that luck has left you Slowly Sleed moved the top card and tossed it across at Duke It was the deuce of clubs making a pair of deuces for Duke Steele An ace king or a five would win for Sleed Friend you are out of luck The Saint s voice seemed to be directed at Silver Sleed I told you that this game cannot be beat but you Sleed spun his card in the air and it fell face up on the pile of chips The trey of spades Staring down at the card Sleed half slumped forward in his chair as he tried to estimate his loss It was more money than he dared estimate He looked up at Duke who was rolling a cigarette Count the chips Sleed said Duke and give me your I O U for it I ll take your count Duke got to his feet and brushed the crumbs of tobacco off the folds of his shirt while Sleed stared up at him His I O U Sleed s eyes shifted and he saw Loper looking at him inquiringly Swiftly Sleed counted the chips stacking them in rows across the table Forty six thousand dollars he said hoarsely Write it out said Duke indifferently Sleed got to his feet and walked to the bar where he secured writing material Laboriously he wrote out the I O U and scrawled his signature at the bottom Without looking at it Duke pocketed it and went out of the door Loper and Fane had moved in close to the bar and as Duke went out of the door Sleed nodded to Loper and indicated for him to go ahead Men were talking softly about the big game the size of Sleed s loss the cold nerve of this stranger A rumble of it came to Sleed s ears and he grinned behind his beard He was sure that he would never have to pay that I O U Voices came from the street arguing laughing quarreling Sleed had turned away as though to go toward the back of the room but he swung around and walked to the door drawn irresistibly by the drama he knew was about to be played VII The Saint was standing at his little table in the center of a crowd advising them not to play his game taking their money when they insisted Duke Steele had elbowed his way to a point just beyond the Saint and was watching the crowd Loper shoved men aside and stepped in front of the table looking curiously down at the two shells Duke had seen Sleed signal Loper in the saloon and he knew that Loper was the one who had killed Ace Ault Loper was Sleed s man and this was their first move against the Saint Don t waste your money friend warned the Saint as Loper took out some gold You can t win Can if I pick the right shell can t I That s the trick friend but it can t be done The Saint rolled the little black pea on the table covered it with a shell and shuffled the shells slowly Fifty dollars declared Loper Pick your shell said the Saint Fifty is a lot of money to give away Loper studied the shells for a moment and made his choice The pea was not there With a swift movement of his hand he upset the other shell and found it empty He stepped back angrily That s a crooked game he roared You just stole my money Loper drew his gun as he rasped out his accusation which was never finished The Saint s hand flashed to his waist a downward and upward movement so fast that it seemed to be one short snap and his pistol spouted fire a second before Loper shot Loper jerked back as though struck by a mighty blow and his bullet sped harmlessly over the Saint s head For an instant the crowd was silent Loper had half caught his balance but it was only an instant before he fell forward on his face Into the startled crowd came Luck running swiftly to the Saint Look out Saint yelled Duke It s a trick to kill you Another pistol thudded from nearer the saloon and the Saint staggered sideways from the shock of the bullet It was Mendez shooting from the sidewalk Duke sprang into a cleared spot and fired twice at Mendez who tried to run but seemed to collapse half way in the saloon door at the feet of Silver Sleed The street cleared as though by magic and Duke could see the Saint on his hands and knees beside his little table trying to pull himself up A woman screamed and a man cursed wonderingly in a high pitched voice As Duke started for the Saint he felt a bullet yank at his shoulder and the crash of a gun came from behind him He turned quickly to see Bill Fane coming toward him Fane shot again before Duke realized that here was another opponent and the bullet seared a furrow across his cheek Duke s hand swung up and he fired quickly Fane stumbled but came on trying to lift his gun which seemed too heavy Again Duke fired and again Fane s gun fell to the ground He seemed to be looking for it searching carefully His knees bent slowly and he sprawled in the street Duke turned around The Saint had got to his feet and was holding to the table with both hands Men were looking out of the saloon door standing far back from the doorway as though afraid to get closer to the street Loper was sprawled on his face just in front of the Saint and had not moved Duke went past him and took the Saint by the arm His white hair and beard were covered with blood and his eyes were closed tightly Come on Saint said Duke Aw this is a hell of a mess ain t it Are yuh hurt bad The Saint mumbled something in his beard but let Duke lead him off the street between two of the buildings Behind them came the sound of voices as the people came back into the street Duke led the Saint around the rear of the buildings until he struck the trail into the Alley His face was bleeding and a dull pain in his shoulder apprised him of the fact that the first bullet had torn through the flesh The Saint mumbled incoherent sentences but led the way to their shack where he sat down on a rock and held his head in his hands Duke tried to examine the Saint s injuries but the old man shoved him away mumbling a curse Duke squinted closely at him It was the first time he had ever heard the Saint curse You sure got hit hard pardner observed Duke I don t reckon yuh never swore because yuh didn t know how From the street came the sound of voices as though the crowd had separated and was searching scattered voices yelling instructions with one group closer than the rest Duke reloaded his pistol and shook the Saint s shoulder Get up Saint There s men comin and we don t know whether they re friends or not But the Saint mumbled thickly and shook his head Came a scraping noise at the doorway and Duke lifted his head to see Luck leaning inside Come out she panted excitedly They are coming to hang you both Hurry Duke yanked the Saint to his feet and shoved him out of the doorway The silhouetted figures of men were coming over the rim of the Alley toward them Follow me whispered Luck It s your only chance The Saint mumbled thickly and tried to protest but Duke hustled him along in the heavy shadow of the rock ledges while behind them came the clamor of voices like a pack of hounds casting for a scent Luck led them angling up the side of the hill over ledges where Duke had to fairly carry the Saint until they came out over the rim Below them shone the yellow lights of the street which seemed to be deserted now From down in Sunshine Alley came the faint voices of the searchers calling to each other voices that echoed strangely from that black cleft in the mountain Luck took them straight to her own home The Saint sat down on the door step and held his head in his hands while he began his incoherent mumble again Whose place is this asked Duke Mine panted Luck Bring him inside Your home Silver Sleed s place Yes Don t you see it s the only place where they won t search But suppose they do argued Duke What will they think of you Miss Luck They won t come here Help him inside please They will think you hid in the rocks tonight I know a trail that leads around Ruby Hill and you can go out that way into the desert Nobody will ever think of watching that trail I ll get your burro and the stuff from your shack Bring him in before some of them pass here They may search the hill tonight Duke helped the Saint to his feet and shoved him into the doorway Luck dropped the heavy blanket curtain over the front window and lit some candles while Duke guided the Saint to a chair The old man s hair and beard were a clotted mass of red and white now and his eyes blinked painfully in the candle light He tried to get to his feet but Duke put a hand on his shoulder The traps mumbled the Saint I m going to take up the traps Jim What does he mean whispered Luck Out of his head said Duke That bullet must have cracked his skull The Saint looked curiously at Duke Are you from St Pierre he asked He don t know you whispered Luck The Saint bowed his head for a moment and then looked back at Duke Did they find her he whispered hoarsely Did they Take it easy pardner soothed Duke I ll have to get yuh out of here ahead of a rope They ain t lookin for her they re lookin for us My father sent me home explained Luck I ran out of the street when the shooting began and he grabbed me He was very angry and made me come home The the men who got shot were friends of my father But I didn t come home then she continued after a moment s pause I heard them say they were going to hang you both We re sure obliged to yuh Miss Luck said Duke slowly We ll get out of here before they find yuh out Came a dull knock on the heavy door Duke drew his gun and stepped in closer to the wall snuffing out one of the candles I ll open it he whispered but Luck motioned him to stop Who is it she called Me Mica Cates answered a muffled voice You paw asked me to find out if yuh was home I m all right said Luck I ll tell him They ain t found them fellers yet Luck but they re still huntin Your dad is willin to pay big for the man what gets em Loper s dead Mendez and Fane are kinda bad but mebbe they ll live For a moment there was silence and then Cates said Member what I said about them buzzards It sure is hard to fool a buzzard G d night Luck turned to Duke her face white in the flickering light of the one candle My dad she said slowly is offering money for your lives Duke thought of the I O U in his pocket Forty six thousand dollars No wonder Silver Sleed was willing to pay well to stop collection on that piece of paper It would break Sleed to pay that bet strip him of his unearned wealth I reckon your dad s got the wrong idea of us said Duke slowly He did not want her to know why Silver Sleed wanted to kill him I ll get your burro and things she said and slipped out through the back entrance before he could stop her The Saint lifted his gory head and stared at her as she went past him He started to get up but sank back in his chair muttering softly wonderingly He looked at Duke closely without a sign of recognition in his eyes How do yuh feel Saint asked Duke How do I feel parroted the Saint Why do you ask me that Where am I Don t yuh remember Saint You re in Silver Sleed s home right now Sleed s home The Saint got slowly out of his chair and looked around as though an inspection of the four walls would corroborate his statement Sleed s home he repeated as though to himself and then to Duke I don t understand I can t Don t yuh remember the shootin in the street One of Sleed s men shot yuh Saint but he paid damn well for it One of Sleed s men What men do you mean It was not the voice of the old Saint Gone was the deep organ like tone and in its place was a harsh rasping enunciation toneless colorless You take it easy old timer advised Duke We ll get out of here first and talk afterwards The Saint heard this indifferently as his hand ran slowly through his great white beard now streaked and clotted with blood Across the room was a mirror in a rough frame and his eyes traveled to this He staggered over to it and peered at himself for several long moments He turned away and staggered against the wall where he stared at Duke wide eyed Who am I he breathed My God who am I His voice was almost a scream and his hands clutched against the rough wall There was no doubt in Duke s mind but that the Saint had gone insane from his wound Easy pardner soothed Duke You ll remember who yuh are Set down and take it easy Who am I whined the Saint paying no heed to Duke s advice Don t you know whom I am Le Saint answered Duke Yes that s my name Le Saint He stared at Duke for several moments shaking his head as though in pain or perplexity Then he said I don t know you but your face is familiar Who are you Duke Steele Yes nodded the Saint that is the name but I don t remember you very well You heard what happened to me didn t you The question was child like in its simplicity and the Saint smiled wistfully as he spoke What happened to you queried Duke I thought everyone knew The factor at Norway Lake told everyone I thought Where s Norway Lake The Saint smiled and shook his head I forgot that you were a stranger It is north of here I am a trapper a free trader they call me There were three of us on Moose River no four But there were only three of us went in there The baby was born that winter The fur was plentiful and our catch was large My wife The Saint stopped and stared at the floor as though unable to continue It was a hard life for a woman away from her own kind I trusted my partner The Saint s manner seemed to change and he cursed witheringly in a mixture of English French and another language which Duke had never heard It seemed to relieve him for he continued The fur was ready to take out in the spring and my partner was to make the voyage alone On the day he left I was going to take up a few traps which had not been lifted Somehow my wife seemed nervous and I questioned her She confessed that she was afraid of my partner I laughed My friend it seemed a huge joke The load of furs was launched and my partner waved adieu I watched him pole away and went to my wife laughing at her grave expression He is gone I said and anyway it is foolish of you to feel as you do about him Has he ever been anything except a good friend to us I do not know she replied as she hugged the baby and went into the cabin I laughed and went on the trail But a man s mind is the devil s garden where seeds of suspicion take root easily and I grew uneasy I would go back to the little cabin and stay with my wife until she was no longer afraid I reached the cabin just in time to see my partner who had returned forcing my wife into the canoe He had come back evidently with the intention of stealing my wife along with the furs I shouted at him as I ran down the shore and I saw him throw my baby bodily into the canoe with my wife who had fainted from her struggle And then he shoved off from the shore just as I reached there but not soon enough to escape The Saint drew his hand across his eyes as though striving to shut out that sight We fought he continued slowly fought like beasts and I whipped him but just before he went down under a powerful blow he managed to fall against the canoe and shove it into the current where the water gains speed for the white rapids below The Saint shook his head slowly I never found them never I forgot the man who was responsible for my loss and he escaped I have sworn to kill him my friend The Indians found the overturned canoe empty For God s sake breathed Duke as the Saint bowed his head over a loss sustained twenty years before It seemed utterly impossible yet true What was your partner s name asked Duke Martin replied the Saint evenly through clenched teeth Duke shook his head He knew no one by the name He knew little about the loss of memory but felt sure that the bullet which had scored the Saint s head had shocked him back twenty years and he shuddered as he wondered what must be the Saint s feeling when he realized that he had lost twenty years of his life From below the cabin came the hoarse yelling of a man like the leader of a wolf pack sounding a view hello to his comrades when he scents the trail anew Shouts answered him Suddenly the back door crashed open and Luck half fell inside panting painfully They know where you are she panted I got your burro and blankets but they found me and took them away Someone made a guess that you were at my house and my father struck him down for the suggestion but they are coming to find out I reckon we ll meet em here said Duke slowly and nodded toward the Saint He s gone crazy Luck As Luck looked toward the Saint he raised his head and looked straight at Duke as he said Who has gone crazy Duke It was the booming voice of the old Saint again He got to his feet and shook his head as though to clear his befogged memory They re cornerin us Saint said Duke and it kinda looks like the end of the trail Come out this way quick urged Luck starting for the rear door which opened on to a rocky slope leading on a steep grade up the side of Ruby Hill The Saint stumbled out of the door with Duke close behind him and they went up the hill winding their way around the tall spires dodging from shadow to shadow to escape the moonlight which lighted the world like a mighty blue tinted incandescent lamp Behind them came the voices of the mob the crashing of the front door of the cabin hollow muffled voices as those inside shouted the information that their quarry had escaped from the rear The tunnels panted Luck The hill is full of them They stopped for a breathing spell and watched the crowd below them climbing the hill their voices plainly audible in the thin atmosphere They re headin for the tunnels shouted Silver Sleed s voice We ll get em now Duke turned and followed Luck climbing higher and higher over the barren rocks while below them came the redoubled shouts of the crowd as they saw the flitting figures far up on the cliffs The Saint exclaimed Duke suddenly Where is he Luck panting against a rock looked back She and Duke were alone Breathlessly they scanned the world below them and watched the crowd coming black figures in that ghostly light All danger to themselves was forgotten What had become of the Saint He s crazy muttered Duke That bullet knocked him crazy but he s my pardner and I m going back Luck They kill you panted Luck My father But Duke Steele was going back down the hill calling softly the Saint s name and Luck followed him There was no sign of him in the path of the coming crowd so Duke and Luck swung wide peering into the shadows until they were almost past the mob which had not seen them return Gawd muttered Duke If we could find him now we could double back on them Suddenly the clamoring crowd went silent It was uncanny Duke led the way swiftly around the base of a broken ledge and they found themselves just at the rear of the halted mob a mob as silent as the dead Just beyond and above them stood the Saint a huge figure back lighted in the moonlight until it seemed that a halo encircled his great white head Silently like a prophet of old he reared his huge bulk in their path as though rebuking them for their evil actions Duke caught his breath It was so unreal weird Kill him grunted Silver Sleed s voice but the crowd did not move It was as though the Saint held a strange power over them Duke gripped his gun tightly and waited There was nothing he could do to help the Saint now Then slowly the Saint began his descent toward the crowd which parted to let him through Miners hardened gamblers killers the riff raff of the new West drew aside in wonderment or fear of this man Slowly he came among them peering into their faces as though seeking someone while they silently stared at him Blood muttered Mica Cates who was near Duke and the girl Blood and buzzards Suddenly the Saint stopped He was looking straight at Silver Sleed now and Silver Sleed s right hand held a cocked pistol at his hip tensed ready to fire Then the Saint spoke The trail ends here Sleed Martin It has been full of shadows and I have only a memory just a memory I want you whom men call Silver Sleed It may only be a nightmare Martin but it is real to me now As the Saint spoke he sprang like a tiger Silver Sleed fired but his bullet smashed into the cliff behind the Saint and before he could shoot again the Saint was upon him Both of them were giant men and they crashed together like two grizzlies while the crowd backed away to give them room knowing nothing of the reasons for the fight Luck had started ahead but Duke drew her back against the rock My God he s stronger than Sleed gasped a man Look at him will yuh The rest of the crowd watched silently the stranger battle Silver Sleed was battling for his life while the old Saint insane with the stored up hate of years and with the super human strength of a madman battered and crushed Silver Sleed without mercy The thudding of mighty blows the crash of clinches scraping of feet on the barren rock but no sound from the mob For all the movement about them they might as well have been fighting alone on the mountain top Suddenly they drew apart only to crash together again but this time Silver Sleed went down striking the back of his head against the rock The Saint stood over him hunched with arms bent like the wings of an eagle about to strike then his arms swept down around Silver Sleed and swung up with Sleed in his arms With a mighty heave he swung the unconscious man across his shoulder turned and lumbered away around the side of the cliffs Stop him screamed a man Stop him echoed the crowd suddenly realizing that they had voices After him they went but the chase was slow It was only a narrow trail which broke off to the sharp cliffs below it Beyond them went the Saint with the sure footedness of a mountain goat traveling at a pace that none dared imitate Duke and Luck followed closely Duke had forgotten that he was also being hunted by the crowd and it is doubtful if any of the crowd knew or cared about him now He s got to go into the Silver Shell tunnel yelled a man That s the end of the trail Beyond this tunnel was a wide crevice in the cliffs which extended back into the mountain It was impossible to go beyond the tunnel either up or down The Saint had trapped himself Stumbling along this trail came the crowd or as many as dared to trust this narrow pathway in the tricky moonlight until they reached the wide ledge which constituted the mouth of the Silver Shell He s bottled up cried a miner but it ain t goin to help Sleed none There s a cross cut tunnel into the Kalura panted a newcomer He ll find that Watch the mouth of the Kalura I tell yuh The crowd ran back along the trail until they could look up and beyond the crevice where the Kalura workings opened out onto a much higher ledge From this spot it was five hundred feet straight down into Sunshine Alley A man cocked his rifle and leaned back against the rocky wall but another jerked the gun away from him You fool Killin the old man won t save Sleed and you can t be sure in this light Suddenly two figures appeared on this ledge silhouetted against the moon Sleed had recovered from his injury and was fighting again They clashed together blending into one figure Then the Saint picked Sleed up in his arms balanced him for a second and hurled him far out over the abyss The man with the rifle dropped it and flung his hands to his eyes and a hoarse gasp went up from the crowd as Sleed s body faded out into the depths falling like a plummet The Saint was standing near the edge of the rock with his arms high above his head as he gazed into space Then his laughter came down to them the choking cackle of a maniac It was the first time that Duke Steele had ever heard the Saint laugh aloud Luck was leaning back against the rock her face as white as snow and with her eyes shut For a moment Duke thought she had fainted but her eyes opened and she stared back at the old Saint atop the ledge still cackling in his glee As he lowered his arms and turned as though to go back into the tunnel he slipped fell sidewise clawing at the rock which slid away with him For a moment he seemed to hang half off the cliff but the edge of the rock seemed to crumble away under his weight and he shot sidewise into space to join Silver Sleed Duke had started forward as though to try and help the Saint and when he turned back Luck was gone Silently the crowd filed past him wordless from the tragedy they had just seen forgetting that he was one of the men they had been hunting Duke gazed for a long time into the silvered depths of the Alley From far away came the eerie wailing cry of a desert coyote Duke shook his head Perhaps it was better for the Saint Memory had only half returned to him the balancing point which might mean insanity He had achieved his purpose after twenty years twenty years of another personality which urged him on to hunt down the man who had ruined his life Suddenly Duke realized that Luck was the daughter of the Saint She had been the lost baby Sleed was Sleed Martin the trapping partner of the Saint Twenty years another person muttered Duke My Gawd No wonder he looked in that glass and asked me who he was Duke turned and went slowly down the hill toward Sleed s cabin A gray burro crossed into the moonlight Duke s burro It was half packed and dragging a blanket The pack sacks were still intact half filled with food and a small keg of water was tied between the saddle posts Luck had made good as far as she was able Duke caught the animal and led it down the hill behind him He did not know where he was going now Near the corner of Sleed s home he stopped Someone was talking and Duke recognized Mica Cates s voice Duke edged in closer Luck was sitting on the rough steps with her head buried in her hands while Mica Cates and another man stood near her It shore was hard luck said Mica softly but I knowed somethin was due to happen But why sobbed Luck Why did that man do it Crazy grunted Mica He called him Martin My daddy s name was Sleed He wa n t responsible Luck said the other man He was jist plumb crazy thasall Don t yuh worry soothed Cates Calico ll take care of yuh Why yo re rich Luck Everythin yore dad had belongs to you You can git eddicated and have silk dresses and Mica Cates seemed to expand and you won t have t live in Calico What become of that other feller queried the other man I reckon we plum forgot him Sleed wanted him especially I wonder if he wasn t crazy too Luck looked up quickly Don t say that He he wasn t crazy Duke turned away and picked up the lead rope of his burro and went softly around the house and down past the lighted town which was strangely silent for Calico A few miles out on the desert he stopped and looked back at the lights of Calico which were now only a tiny flicker against the dead black of the hills Slowly he drew out a folded paper from his pocket and looked at the scrawl thereon I owe you forty six thousand dollars Silver Sleed Duke glanced back at Calico as he slowly tore the paper into bits and scattered them to the wind He picked up the lead rope and spoke softly to the burro One man wondered if I was crazy and she denied it Forty six thousand dollars I wonder which was right And he turned and went into the misty spaces of the desert alone Transcriber s note The Table of Contents at the beginning of the book was created by the transcriber Minor

America VAL SINESTRA BOOK I The lives of men and women are pictures thrown upon the screen of Time The Past its misty perspective its legendary charm Truth veiled in Fiction VAL SINESTRA BOOK I About twenty five years ago Pedro Gonzola bought that handsome brown stone residence at the corner of Twelfth Street and Fifth Avenue and presented it to his bride on their wedding day As the name implied they were of Spanish origin and known as devout Catholics supporting the Church spiritually and materially Shortly before Julie was born her father died suddenly stricken down with heart failure The young widow was stunned by the loss of her handsome adoring husband her uncontrollable grief nearly cost her the life of her coming child who suffered from her mother s anguish at least that s what the good Dr McClaren said After her great misfortune Mrs Gonzola gave up the world and devoted herself to her religion and the care of her little daughter Julie was sent to the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Seventeenth Street The Sisters educated her under the personal supervision of her mother their reports were satisfactory the child was docile and receptive but inclined to emotional exaggeration she would remain in the chapel long after the other children had left and once they found her prostrate before the Virgin in a state of ecstatic self oblivion which ended in a fit of hysteria There was no cause for worry as otherwise she was full of life and a general favorite Mrs Gonzola tried conscientiously to impress her daughter with the dignity of her wealth social position and family distinction but as the girl grew into a woman there was an ever present irritating sense of failure Julie Gonzola at sixteen with her brilliant exotic beauty was a mystery to her friends her mother herself She was acutely conscious of strange emotions which she instinctively concealed hers was a nature of unexpected impulses tragic possibilities baffling secrets She came of an old stock on her father s side and on her mother s she could look down a long corridor where she saw shadowy forms which frightened her She was different from her girl friend who was care free bubbling sparkling dashing along like a brook which overflows its bounds out of sheer rapture Maud Ailsworth lived down the street There were no complications in her life She ruled her mother who was an invalid and physically her inferior Maud romped all day long in the street with the boys Mrs Gonzola never allowed Julie to do that she was very indulgent in her way denying the girl nothing but freedom Julie was outwardly submissive she was sorry for her mother who sat alone in her room crying silent iron tears of impotent despair There were two boys in the street whom Maud liked as she grew older she determined to marry one of them but she found to her great disappointment they were both hot after Julie Floyd Garrison a pretty boy of an old American family was very well brought up Martin Steele was a mongrel a brute a ruffian but there was something very likable about him Maud looked on watched them wrestling for the privilege of carrying Julie s books when she came from school with her maid There were fist fights for her as children rivalry as youths and bitterness as men But Maud wasn t discouraged Julie couldn t marry both of them there would be always one left for her Then she had Tom Dillon in reserve he was common but she owned him he was her slave Julie was afraid of Martin Steele he had bad manners and a violent temper He was always mussing up her hair and winding her curls around his fingers Floyd was too polite to do that There was a party at Maud Ailsworth s Tom Dillon that mischievous imp put out the lights The boy next to Julie kissed her pressing her to him with terrible force it was Martin After that he kissed her whenever he found her alone and he managed it often She liked his hot unboyish kisses The Garrisons had lived four generations in a little wooden house in East Twelfth Street a very pretty shanty Martin called it set back with a garden and a wooden fence to protect the lawn and flowers from passing vandals A portrait of the ancestor who founded the family fortune hangs today in our Museum Yan Geritsen baker endowed with business sagacity bought land under water in New Amsterdam for thirty cents left it to his son with orders not to sell Succeeding generations drained and developed it The name smelt of newly baked bread it gradually evolved itself into Garrison They were one of the fast disappearing families who remained as they began modest and thankful They brought up their son with a sense of responsibility as trustee for the coming son There were no girls as far back as could be remembered each family branch had one son Floyd s father Jimmy Garrison married a school marm He became acquainted with her in Boston She was very poor but descended from the Aldens Prudence Alden was a pale silent girl with a hidden fountain of irrepressible love in all its rare purity Young Garrison s friends couldn t see what he saw in her Garrison had never been in business he disliked the everlasting talk about money which was rapidly becoming God under the title of the Almighty dollar He had many acquaintances and one faithful friend Colonel Garland a Southern gentleman who had made a reputation up North as a corporation lawyer when trusts were springing up over night like toadstools The Colonel retained his sombrero his soft accent his passionate devotion to a few friends and many women When Jimmy Garrison put the administration of his estate into Colonel Garland s hands it was intact just as his father had left it Let us pull down those old hulks and build up warehouses said the Colonel Garrison refused to consider that The estate was not bought yesterday for speculation It has always brought us enough to live on modestly and something over if I get four per cent I m well satisfied In time modern buildings were erected on both sides of the Garrison hulks which although kept clean and in repair had to be rented below the market value Conservative policy has its good side many went under in the frenzy of over building In such a young country the cult of silence material rest creative thought were as yet unknown the man who did not create capital was considered an idler Garrison continued to the end of his peaceful worryless life a gentleman The first realization of pain was the sudden death of his beloved Prudence he had to live for his boy and looked about seeking a sustaining force He rigged up a workshop in the top of his house and took to modeling figures which were very well done every day people he had known the little Italian shoe boy the newspaper woman his friends idealized of course his wife in every mood his boy He was particularly successful with a smiling old Irishman a pipe in his mouth a hod on his shoulder standing at the foot of a ladder looking upward He called that figure the Ancestor which title was a secret source of amusement to him although he was too good natured to say whose ancestor When asked the inevitable question What business are you in Mr Garrison Garrison would answer gravely I muddle in clay The Steeles lived next door to the Garrisons in an ugly high stoop four story brick mansion which threw a dark shadow on one side of the little garden necessitating Garrison to move his flower beds away Martin was five years older than Floyd and twenty years more experienced He loved Floyd in his way but love was not an element of his nature Floyd looked up to him as a little boy would to an elder one who condescended to be his friend he was sorry for Martin because Mrs Steele was only his stepmother that was what was wrong with him he never had a real mother Mrs Steele was born Dolly Winthrop of Boston she was very tall very thin very straight with small transparent ears lying flat against her head The only large thing about her was her flow of language that was tremendous Mrs Steele s family tree reposed on the parlor table in a red velvet album reposed is a very inappropriate word for she never gave the poor thing any rest She was constantly turning over its pages adding multiplying never subtracting until it fell quite to pieces but she convinced the old New Yorkers of her right to be one of them The exclusives of Massachusetts never forgave Dolly Winthrop s marriage with that Steele man who was fat florid wordless and a widower with a child There were still spots in the Union where pedigree and culture were of more value than money but Dolly Winthrop had made her calculation and it turned out a good bargain Her husband and his father devoted all their time to business they accumulated great wealth and were not perceptible in her richly woven society tapestry There was one she couldn t wipe out that terrible boy Martin She tried honestly to make something of him but he was not to be moulded She took him to her summer home in Nantucket The Winthrop Homestead had ship lamps a model of the Mayflower clocks that struck bells numbered hours were disdained there were also stuffed seagulls which Martin set up as skittles and a tottering old sailor who took care of the garden and gave the necessary atmosphere Aunt Priscilla Mrs Steele s maiden sister lived there all the year In Nantucket Martin s capacity of hatred found fertile soil for expansion he hated the ocean its unceasing roar fretted him he thought of a big sea monster in chains writhing howling foaming at the mouth He hated Aunt Priscilla who was Calvinist Puritan Patriot anti everything else She took unusual pains to enlighten the little savage about the distinguished pedigree of his stepmother s family One day she read to him for three hours in her correct English twang the history of those good old Colonial times when her direct ancestor was a Judge in Salem The boy s eyes took on a glitter which meant mischief I d like to be a Judge in them times You mean you d like to have been a Judge in those times corrected Aunt Priscilla Have been mumbled the boy Aunt Priscilla was delighted at last she had awakened the pride of ancestry in that little soul Now tell me dear what would you have done if you had been a Judge in Salem I d burn you One day Floyd found out there was a mystery on the top floor of the Steele house it was Martin s fourteenth birthday He invited Floyd to ice cream and cake Julie Gonzola was coming There was plenty to eat but Floyd lost his appetite looking at little Julie sitting up on a high chair with all the best things piled before her She let Martin pile them but she didn t touch them she couldn t in a strange house Toward evening the maid came to take her home The two boys stood at the window as she went past enveloped in white furs her little feet stepping out firmly her head erect Martin s eyes snapped I m going to marry Julie Not if I know it Martin turned and swept the boy with a cold disdain terrible in one so young It hurt Floyd he remembered that look years after He said nothing but turned to go Martin stopped him Stay with me I m lonesome There was a touch of pathos in his voice Come I ll show you some family relics He led the way to the garret four stories high it was filled with old furniture spinning wheels oil paintings some wretchedly bad others fairly good all with heavy gold frames every piece was ticketed with a name and date in the different generations of the family Then Martin became confidential I ll tell you something but don t mention it to my mother These things are all fakes she haunts the auction sales she s a good judge she knows what fits in she s got a whole lot more in storage We re going to move away from here Floyd got a chill What You were born here You will never leave your home Martin s mocking laugh rang out Oh you re too sentimental She s not going to sell the house that wouldn t look well She s going to fill it with our family antiques and donate it to the city as an Art Museum Floyd was struck silent as usual by Martin s terrible lack of heart What s that What Somebody singing Martin looked troubled Nonsense there s nobody up here Let s go down He drew Floyd into the hall there was a door opposite It was somebody singing a man s voice broken harsh rising and falling in a strange inflection Martin with a look of fear mingled with shame tried to draw Floyd downstairs A heavy fist on the door pushed it open A man of gigantic stature rushed out At first glance Floyd saw only a pair of wonderful mocking eyes Martin s eyes there was a strange light in them The man was mad Martin sprang at him tried to push him back into the room He was too strong for the boy Then Martin coaxed him Was that Martin s voice so loving so sweet He spoke in a foreign tongue strange to Floyd The old man looked curiously at Floyd then said Grutsie and bowed respectfully He learnt afterwards Grutsie was Swiss dialect for I greet you The man had huge hands knotty sun dried the open flannel shirt revealed a chest covered with thick hair He had an enormous head and a thick white mane falling over his eyes He wore corduroy trousers to the knees and a pair of high deerskin boots with heavy nails in the soles He paced unceasingly The floor was covered with indentures Martin shut the door carefully took down a harness with bells which hung on the wall threw it over the old man s head cracking a heavy whip yelling at the top of his voice lashing him with sharp quick blows The old man growled like a beaten beast the whip hurt him the young devil was strong in the sensual intoxication of brute force they forgot the horrified boy looking on The door was flung open Mrs Steele stood there deathly pale Stop that noise you ll rouse the neighbors how dare you bring Floyd up here She grasped Martin s hand pushing him toward the door The old man slunk into a corner he was evidently afraid of her Let me go roared Martin I won t You ll be punished for this Then a struggle followed Floyd never forgot it She held him with her small strong hands he bit them She struck him across the mouth he kicked her She cried out with pain but she held him fast Floyd with a terrified cry rushed down the stairs and out of the house Mr Garrison was working at his clay figures thinking how much Floyd was growing like his mother he had her sensitive ideal nature The boy s love for Julie might be a great blessing it might be the contrary He would like to live long enough to see that beautiful little girl a woman Floyd broke into the room sobbing out what he had seen Mr Garrison quieted him and told him the story of the Steele family as he had it from his friend Colonel Garland The old man in the garret was Martin s grandfather a Swiss peasant who had come to America in the steerage with his boy a child of four He obtained a position as waiter in a downtown cafe and the boy grew up in the streets In ten years the father was head waiter in a Fifth Avenue hotel frequented by Wall Street men He never spoke more than a waiter s English His boy came out of school with a correct knowledge of grammar but was silent uncouth unfriendly Waiting for his father one night in the kitchen of the hotel he noticed one of the dishwashers a very young blonde girl crying bitterly He questioned her she told him she was Swiss like himself that she had been in America a short time and was very unhappy He comforted her When it became no longer possible to conceal her condition he married her this was a bitter blow to the old waiter who had in those twenty years of deprivation saved one hundred thousand dollars and wanted to make a gentleman out of his son Fate favored him The girl died giving birth to a boy The doctors could not understand the case she was a very strong healthy peasant but Martin in a burst of anguish insisted she had died of homesickness Mr Garrison explained to Floyd the word nostalgia originating with the Swiss which meant their longing for their native soil when absent the pain is intolerable ending often in death Floyd was very sorry for the poor peasant mother Then what happened The old man started in the hotel supply business he rented one of my shanties on the river front The firm is still there I used to see old Steele walking up and down before that sign on the door Martin Steele and Son I could never make friends with young Steele he was sullen wordless and seemed to be out of his element Then they bought the house next door and lived there a solitary life Your mother was sorry for lonely little Martin and had him often in here to play with you When Dolly Winthrop came from Boston to visit us we saw she had her eye on the rich widower And she got him said Floyd Yes unfortunately for him And what happened then father She dominated those poor men with her culture shamed them with her pedigree crushed them with her contempt The old man fell into bad habits drank to excess His mind failed people spoke of an illiterate grandfather in the house but visitors never saw him After that episode in the garret Mrs Steele s patience with the boy gave out She insisted on sending him to a strict military school He d come home in the summertime when she was in Nantucket and prowl about the city during the long evenings In Twelfth Street seemingly deserted he d run up and down stoops pulling bells then the spring rollers would fly up and he d count the genteel poor who were sweltering in New York when he grew too old for such pranks he would spend his evenings in the garret watching his father and grandfather playing a strange game of cards called Tarac and listening to their jargon He learnt the game and the jargon with great rapidity His father who was always afraid of troubling his wife died suddenly at his desk then the old man s mind bolted Mrs Steele in a burst of confidence said one day to Mr Garrison It may be very wicked of me but I pray to God not to let him live long Her prayer was answered unrighteous prayers usually are After that Mrs Steele closed the house and went to live in Boston later she sent Martin to Harvard Floyd wrote him several times but his letters were not answered it was many years before the two boys met again Floyd didn t go to college his father couldn t spare him but he gave him a good classical education under the best professors Mr Garrison wasn t training his son for business he wanted him to be a man of culture They took long walks into the country with Emerson Hawthorne Longfellow for companions Thoreau was revolutionary a disjointed mind The historical novels then in vogue were read and reread also foreign literature Realism Nihilism and all the other isms were looked into and studied as the result of unhealthy European conditions Mr Garrison moulded his son in good clay Sunday was the happiest day in the week for Floyd He would slip out of the little Dutch Reform church around the corner restless when the pastor strung out his sermon fearing he should miss Julie who went to the Cathedral Lately he was fortunate to find her there without her mother Good Friday the Cathedral draped in black The sorrow laden music the odor of incense gave him a sensuous feeling of emotion Julie came down the aisle her prayer book pressed against her heart her eyes seeking things beyond this world It seemed to the impressionable youth a desecration to bring her back He looked at the sad faces and bowed heads It s wonderful after so many centuries this sense of personal loss in the people life would be unbearable without the Easter joy the lilies the Resurrection His words sounded poetical to him as he spoke he was very young Julie smiled she seemed less divine out in the sunlight I don t feel that way but Mother is ill and insists on my going an empty pew doesn t look well Floyd was shocked He had read in the great writers those traditional truisms we repeat mechanically The woman s emotional nature endows her with the gift of Faith she has held aloft the Banner of Religion in the great struggle against skepticism They walked down Fifth Avenue There was an expression he had never seen in Julie s calm face an indefinable something as if she had pulled down a veil over her eyes Before her house she didn t give him her hand as usual She was looking expectantly at the upper windows he followed her gaze She waved her hand smilingly there was a face looking out the light made it transparent like yellow wax In a moment it was gone Who was that My grandfather Why haven t I seen him before He doesn t come downstairs Is he ill No I ve wanted to tell you for some time but Mother said it was nobody s business Floyd was hurt Anything that concerns you is of vital interest to me You know that don t you Julie Yes I know it She braced her shoulders looking him straight in the face she was very proud He liked that most girls held themselves too cheaply My grandfather doesn t come down because he disapproves of the way we live He says we have sold our souls I don t understand you We are Jews You needn t come here again She went quickly up the steps and entered the house without looking back Floyd walked down the street towards his house He was terribly excited socially he had never known any Jews He had seen some dark fellows who were wonders at mathematics and chess boys of their creed were limited in numbers in the colleges kept out of social clubs but somehow they managed to filter through everywhere What did it mean How could the Gonzolas be Jews They were Catholics A young man came towards him of striking appearance with a touch of something about him not American He put out his hand laughingly to Floyd It was Martin You ve done with me You deserve it Why didn t you answer my letters Oh I had no time they kept my nose to the grindstone I walked off with the prizes just to spite Aunt Priscilla Mother is very proud of me she calls me my son now There was the old mocking glitter in his eye he had not changed Don t be angry with me He took Floyd s arm Martin could be very winning when he wanted to You ve grown into a fine handsome fellow with the unmistakable brand of the aristocrat strong with the women eh I don t know As gone as ever on Julie More than ever Then Floyd shot out a question Do you know the history of the Gonzolas Martin s answer came back as quickly Yes they are baptized Jews A red streak flushed Floyd s forehead Tell me about them Martin leaned against the gate revelling in Floyd s agitation The Gonzolas go back to the time when the Church in Spain commenced war on the Jews thousands of them were baptized but they still practiced their religion in secret Romantic isn t it No terrible Many of the Catholic Gonzolas became Bishops Cardinals and high state officials on account of their wealth and culture but others true to their Faith fled to Amsterdam where they founded the great banking house which spread its branches all over Europe Julie s grandfather was a handsome dashing fellow He married in the family they all do but he had an affair with an Austrian actress which lasted for years Their son was brought up in the religion of his mother who became pious with age and as expiation dedicated him to the Church She died before he was ordained and Gonzola naturally opposed easily persuaded the boy against it and sent him to America where he took the family name The bank he founded here was successful he became very rich This bastard was Julie s father But they are Catholics not Jews insisted Floyd That s the joke of it laughed Martin An ironic witticism an impish trick of Fate Pedro came with letters from his father to an old friend Joseph Abravanel an orthodox Jew a fanatic of Spanish origin with infernal pride of race He boasts his ancestors provided money to help Columbus fit out his ship Pedro fell desperately in love with Ruth Abravanel those Spanish Jewesses are handsome but most of them are old maids because they won t marry the Germans whom they look down upon That old man I saw today at the window Is Joseph Abravanel Mrs Gonzola s father But how did you know all this I ve heard it scores of times from Julie The crossing of the races interests me I ve got my own ideas about that I m waiting to see how it comes out It s shocking for people to change their religion Martin laughed a bit too loud Floyd thought What s the difference Who believes in it anyhow do you Floyd evaded a direct answer We practice many things out of respect for our parents and our social position He was undeniably well brought up There s one thing I like about Julie said Martin In spite of everything she remains a true daughter of her race I like in her the sensuousness of the Oriental oh I don t mean sexness that may also be there latent I hope it is I see in her the Shulamite maiden who gets up from her couch at night and goes to seek her lover What do you know about Julie You ve been away so long I ve been a week in New York Floyd was angry injured Perhaps you ve been writing to her all this time Perhaps I have I suppose she was very glad to see you I don t know I was mad to see her I couldn t wait I went straight there There was a look of passion in Martin s face Floyd hated him He turned and entered the gate Martin was at his elbow I m coming in to see your father At dinner Martin kept up a fire of witty criticisms Floyd was silent preoccupied Your house has been shut up for some time Where is your mother In Nantucket She loves the shores where her ancestors landed in sailing vessels Your mother s pride of nationality is quite natural I also feel it You don t parade it My mother makes capital out of it But insisted Mr Garrison you are an American you were born here you know no other home English is your mother tongue Yes but race is stronger than language My people were Swiss peasants I may look and speak like a gentleman but sometimes the lout in me is hard to suppress There was a silence Mr Garrison changed the subject Are you going into your father s business No I d smash it with my mad notions Then he flashed a bright look I ve been daubing in oil it s the only thing that interests me I shall go to Paris to study if I live Mr Garrison was all animation That s very good news You will live you re young strong Who knows America is going into the wholesale slaughter business She needs butchers You mean I think we ll be pushed into the War Floyd was all attention He spoke with a thrill in his voice If it comes we Americans will not be wanting in patriotism Martin didn t seem to feel the insinuation Patriotism bah Who cares We ll have to go if we don t they ll shoot us Mr Garrison was sitting with his head in his hands Floyd arose and went to him He had been failing for some time complained of dizziness Dr McClaren couldn t discover any organic trouble Floyd who watched every change of expression saw him grow pale Father you don t feel well Oh yes but I think I ll go and rest awhile He rose from the chair staggered Martin caught him carried him up and laid him on the bed Floyd bent over his father frantically begging him to speak The stricken man raised his hand in a mute blessing then closed his eyes To Floyd the next few weeks were chaotic time space light darkness lost all meaning Martin never left him during those black days always there in the sleepless horror of the night to read to him to go out and pace the streets with him when the walls became insupportable He would have gone under without Martin The funeral over the will read by Colonel Garland the sole executor the few distant relatives from far and near come and gone Floyd took up again the routine of life Mr Garrison had left everything to his son whom he hoped would marry young and be happy in the old home leaving it to his son after him The Garrisons had always lived well in a modest way befitting their position He was sure Floyd would keep up the family tradition He left money to many philanthropic institutions and to his club where he and his father before him had spent many pleasant hours and where he hoped his boy would sit many years after him Colonel Garland commenting on the will to Martin said A sane righteous testament He was a good man In the months that followed Floyd saw little of Julie She called several times with her mother who was very sweet and amiable I hope when you feel more like seeing people you ll come to us often said Mrs Gonzola Floyd looked at Julie who smiled at him and returned the pressure of his hand Martin was a great deal at the Gonzolas but he didn t mention that to Floyd One Sunday afternoon Mrs Gonzola came into the parlor Martin was sitting very close to Julie reading in rich passionate tones a love poem by Oscar Wilde Julie started up and Martin left but all that day she couldn t meet her mother s clairvoyant eyes I don t like him Julie He s no class He was an unmannerly boy and he s a dangerous man I ve told James to say you re out the next time he calls If you meet him accidentally avoid him Yes Mother said Julie After that she saw him often with the assistance of a sympathetic French teacher whose room was post office and rendezvous for the lovers Martin gave Julie glimpses of life He took her to all kinds of strange places a chop suey restaurant with its unpalatable dishes soft lights and insidious Chinamen a dancing cafe which at that time was not supposed to be a place for young ladies but best of all was Hippolyte Hippolyte s Parlor flaunted on Fifth Avenue It had a magnificent plate glass show window fitted with Circassian walnut in which was one red feather fan on a cushion of Nile green velvet one jeweled comb and a Pierrot costumed in black silk with a large white ruff his face wonderful in its languid perversity Up the side street there was a private door which opened halfway to let in ladies heavily veiled Julie s ambition was to see what was behind that fascinating door today it is no longer a mystery In the Middle Ages Hippolyte would have been a miracle man summoned to a fair Venetian to deepen the red of her hair the rose in her cheeks the marvel of her eyes selling for a purse of gold charms to rob a rival of a coveted lover Times have not changed nor people only appearances Martin took Julie into the shop one day and introduced her to Hippolyte who pronounced her ravissante thereupon Martin bought a costly box of perfume Julie was afraid to take it home I ll settle that laughed Martin and poured it over her then they ran around the reservoir to get rid of the odor Mrs Gonzola noticed it but said nothing Julie was standing at the window waiting for her mother Her gloved hands impatiently agitating the curtains Mother the car is here I shall be late for my music lesson The voice answering from upstairs was nervous trembling It s impossible for me to go with you today I m not well A flash illumined Julie s face but her voice was under perfect control I m sorry From the upper window her mother watched her music roll in hand stepping into the car Mrs Gonzola realized more and more acutely that her lovely child was developing into a beautiful woman there was no feeling of joyful pride Horrible agonizing fear stopped the current of her blood Julie alone in the car drew a long breath The pink of her lips turned red the color slowly overflowing into her cheeks She pulled the cord asked the chauffeur in her soft sensuous voice to stop at the nearest drug store there she telephoned then drove to the house of her professor She was a gifted pianiste she played with a sure velvety touch surmounting with ease all technical difficulties The professor went into ecstasies about the beautiful child woman with Eternal Love in her fingers The car turned into the Park Martin was walking up and down by the little lake He hated to wait She never kept an appointment if she didn t come today he was through His heart leaped when he saw her The girl had a terrible power over him She said smilingly We ll go across town and up Riverside Drive for an hour Then I ll drop you at the club They sped along in the car He pulled down the shades drew off her gloves tearing the buttons in his haste crushed her two hands in his moist hot ones spoke quickly panting with excitement I ve thought it all out I m going to your mother tonight No No gasped Julie Write to her first I have written to her as politely as I knew how I told her I loved you and wanted you to be my wife He read the answer his voice shaking with anger and wounded pride I have no words to reply to your impertinent letter Julie will not marry until she is of age You are not the man I consider worthy of her You take it for granted that she is willing I know her better She will not consent I warn you not to molest her with further attentions and consider the matter closed She crouched in the corner speechless She will blame me She will say I encouraged you You did didn t you Yes but marriage I m too young yet He pressed her to him with a force that left her helpless He would show her haughty mother who was the master With his face pressed against hers he talked expostulated begged threatened to kill himself kissing her again and again until she gave in She would do anything everything he asked of her but he must give her twenty four hours to win over her mother If you fail Then I will go with you You promise Yes Julie Your mother will influence you against me No one can do that You are mine I will not give you up He swore an oath which made her shudder With a quiver of terrible joy she put her arms around his neck Her lips sought his Every afternoon Floyd Garrison occupied a deep chair in the window of his club on upper Fifth Avenue a privilege inherited by the law of precedence from his father and grandfather His great grandfather was one of the founders of the original club house which was downtown an old building with raftered ceilings wooden models of ships and a portrait of Peter with the game leg In time the youngsters of moved uptown refurnished in plush and became very exclusive They kept people out for lack of pedigree or difference of religious conviction A young scion of the new rich said enviously to Floyd I spend much more on my tailor than you do you can afford to wear your old clothes Floyd smiled He took in the young man a fighting figure physically strong eager on the alert with gambler s eyes You ve never had to sweat blood for money The expression was coarse but it threw a mental picture No I ve never sweated blood for a living I didn t say a living I said money Any idiot can make a living A man must have money and lots of it to be anybody it s a hot game He wiped his forehead Floyd wondered if money could buy his armchair in the club window He was sure it couldn t but he was a gentlemanly young fellow he wouldn t hurt the man s feelings Destiny had been more than kind to him He wasn t grateful he took life s favors as a matter of course In fact he never gave it any thought When his father died sorrow blunted the keen edge of existence now after a year he was waking up His heart s desire was Julie Gonzola He had no fear it was the eve of fulfillment Sitting there in the club window idly watching the traffic he saw the Gonzola car Julie was inside with Martin They stopped at the entrance Martin sprang out Floyd waited for him with a pleasant touch of expectancy Now there would be a long talk about Julie He came swinging in his dark face quivering with excitement Floyd didn t take Martin seriously his unpleasant emotional nature gave his actions a touch of exaggeration which repelled Floyd with his calm undisturbed nature Well why all this excitement What s happened now He spoke laughingly Martin was always getting into some transient mix up I may as well tell you you ll have to know it I ve asked Julie to marry me Floyd was on his feet hurt angry Martin had listened hours to what he called love ravings about Julie knowing he was waiting only for his year of mourning to expire It was treachery They faced each other Martin had an air of triumph but he turned away from Floyd s accusing eyes I ve given her twenty four hours to prepare her mother She ll not consent Oh won t she I know the way to make her Then he walked away Julie crouched in the corner of the car her dark pupils contracting dilating she was going home to prepare her mother The contempt in that letter she had written to Martin was awful but she had promised and she braced herself for the fight She was used to battles bitter uncompromising used to the struggle of antagonistic spirits but she had always been kept out of all that agony pampered spoilt worshipped by her mother indulged by her grandfather and now she must fight them both and she would If they stood out against Martin she would keep her word and go away with him this was her determination She stepped out of the car and found her mother waiting for her in the hall she knew what was coming Mrs Gonzola led the way upstairs to her bedroom watched Julie take off her hat and coat and smooth down her hair How long have you been meeting this man without my knowledge You mean Martin Yes Since you forbade him the house This is the first time in your life that you have openly disobeyed me Why did you do it I love him Mother and he loves me and I am going to marry him She had rehearsed it in the car Mrs Gonzola implored her not to marry that ruffian who had intrigued to get her affection No man of honor would have acted like that He was not the man for her she was too young to realize it she would hate him in the end She begged entreated her to wait a year Julie burst into convulsed sobs He won t wait Mother I ve been through all that with him Mother Mother Don t stop it don t I must marry him I must Mrs Gonzola gave a terrible cry What do you mean tell me Why must you marry him Why Because because he says he ll kill me if I don t Then Mrs Gonzola warned her of the anger of Father Cabello who would never marry her to an atheist a heretic warned her of her grandfather s curses and the old Jew could curse she heard him again as he stood over her on the day of her marriage pouring out his anger His curses had come true in her wretched life and this disobedient child she was suffering as he had suffered that day but now the old man was her only hope Julie worshipped him She threatened her with his anger the wrath of the great Jewish God who does not forgive who would bring down punishment upon her and her children s children The girl lay flat on the ground quivering with horror fear then she became quite cold and stiff and fell into a cataleptic trance which lasted an hour Mrs Gonzola undressed her put her into bed and lay beside her holding her close The girl gradually grew warm and smiled at her mother The spasm of obstinacy over she was again the submissive child She would sacrifice herself and Martin it was her duty she became calm almost cheerful as was usual after those spells She wanted her mother to dress her as she did when she was a child Mrs Gonzola was happy her life was bound up in this girl You look so beautiful Julie go and show grandfather Mrs Gonzola stood at the bottom of the stairs till Julie went in where Joseph Abravanel sat reading unconscious of the tragedy which had been enacted below He blessed her called her a good child the hope of his life Then she and her mother dined in the big room with its dark Spanish tapestry and gold plate it was a festive occasion Mrs Gonzola praised Floyd and his devotion to the memory of his father You always liked him best as a child didn t you Julie No Mother I I liked them both Then the fear came again of Martin He will kill me Mother I m afraid of him afraid Julie I have no strength to fight for you Marry Floyd he is a simple honest boy He has always loved you To her mother s great amazement Julie answered in slow deliberate tones That will be the only way to save myself but it must be at once I mustn t have time to think about it or I couldn t do it Floyd went home early that afternoon stopping before the little gate He had taken great pains with his garden The lawn was velvety smooth beds of flowers were banked up against the porch geraniums bloomed in boxes at the windows The polished brass knocker the soft white curtain gave the little house an atmosphere of purity cleanliness Passers stopped to admire it they felt that nice people lived there Floyd shook off a sick feeling anger nauseated him The knocker gave out a musical call The door was opened by a bright little Japanese boy the old servants had gradually left during the lonely year of mourning There was nothing changed in the house the wood fire lit the candles on the table set for two he saw his father at the head of it After dinner the boy brought his slippers and velvet house jacket He stretched himself in a big chair and lit his pipe He loved his pipe that was the Knickerbocker strain in him he smoked it with reverence as the old Dutchmen did in the days when pipes were longer and tobacco better He loved to sit before the wood fire and listen to its hissing crackling singing he thought of his mother s ancestors those sturdy Pioneers in their cabins piling on the logs bolting their iron shutters against the howling wolves outside who devoured the bodies and cracked the bones of men The Puritans are gone but the wolves are still with us they eat the soul and sow wolf seed Then he thought how his father had planned his life for him just as he had laid out his garden It had not occurred to him that his son s life must be different from his own His father s time was far away Today things change with a flash there is no more slow development a fire a storm lightning ruins He was a fool to be so sure of Julie she had been very sympathetic in his year of mourning He took it for love Martin that vulgarian with his family history He never had the slightest suspicion of what was going on between them He d been a blind fool He jumped to his feet the clock struck ten Twenty four hours to prepare her mother Why hadn t she said No at once and put an end to it She couldn t want to marry him it was unthinkable but he never knew quite what she did think When he said A penny for your thoughts she grew very serious My thoughts are only for myself He became impatient Why make the thing so complicated It was simple enough they both wanted her and they d have to fight for her as they did as boys They never knew which of them she liked The telephone rang He took up the receiver It was Mrs Gonzola s voice Is it you Floyd Yes Could you come over for a few moments It s late but I ll come at once He stood before the mirror in the hall It reflected a young man clean shaven straight brows eyes deep blue almost black the mouth set with suppressed pain that was all the image gave out nothing of the unsounded depths The narcotic of ease and inherited aloofness had kept the lion of character sleeping Passing the Dillon house Floyd noticed vaguely a sign For Sale Tom Dillon had inherited a large fortune which his father made in whiskey he had boasted he would drink up the well stocked cellar before he got rid of the house It was illuminated tonight he heard music and loud laughter Tom was on the job In the parlor of the Gonzola mansion the butler pressed a button which lit up the unaccountable glass prisms of the electrified fixture it was a familiar room As a boy its grandeur had awed him when he grew older he thought it old fashioned but he didn t want to see it changed He knew little of the other part of the house excepting the dining room which was in old leather heavy dark He had always spoken with superiority of the charming Spanish atmosphere of the room Tonight it struck him differently What an ignorant fool he was A man who mentally kicks himself for being all kinds of a fool is often awakening to wisdom The floor was parquet smooth and polished There were Oriental rugs and deep armchairs upholstered in Turkish and a broad divan with wonderful silk rugs thrown over it Fur animals lay about with enormous heads and glassy eyes The window hangings were of costly lace He had often looked at that bronze figure in a corner tonight it spoke to him It was the Moses of Michael Angelo a noble head with a rippling flowing beard The walls were covered with family portraits in gilt frames turning old gold with age He had said with authority they are Van Dykes Now he noticed signed names unknown to him probably young foreign artists He stood before a portrait of Pedro Gonzola Julie s grandfather painted in Amsterdam after a ball costume A very handsome young cavalier in black velvet with white lace falling over his long tapering fingers he thought of Martin s coarse hands no the room was not Spanish Mrs Gonzola came in she too took on a new significance a woman of fifty small sinuous with pale eyelids forehead lips the process of Time had almost washed out the human face which had been even at its best but a soft water color Tonight Floyd seemed to see within that white Image Past struggles like smothered flames flashed up again momentarily Her English was perfect so academic it sounded foreign born in New York taught by professors she spoke like one She had tried to bring Julie up that way but changed conditions were too strong for her Floyd I am in a terrible dilemma Martin has asked Julie to marry him Yes I know She tried to draw away her hands but Floyd held them fast Your decision means everything to me Floyd put his arm around her he had known her all his life She clung to him there were tears in her voice but her eyes were dry Julie told you of our ancestry Yes Does it make any difference Why should it An evasive answer Why didn t he make it simple and say No Some people are prejudiced but you have no family ties and are not religious I don t want Julie to marry Martin he s vulgar they are peasants common cattle drivers his grandfather was a waiter I can t think of it it s too horrible Floyd tried to be fair But if Julie likes him better She does not I m sure of it She is very impressionable Martin has a kind of brute force you know him He ll talk her into it It will be a terrible misfortune for her it will ruin her life I must make it impossible I must Floyd was speechless with excitement She had her arms around him clinging to him Julie is a strange girl at the mercy of inherited instincts she will be safe with you Why did she say that What was wrong with Julie Floyd began to take Julie s part against her mother Mrs Gonzola be calm I beg of you You know I have wanted Julie all my life you know I want her now If she loves Martin better what what can I do No no she will tell you herself Mrs Gonzola glided out of the room Floyd wiped his forehead What did it all mean Why was she so afraid of Martin What was he doing there anyhow Martin had been open with him now he was conspiring with her mother No he would do nothing underhand He would give Martin a chance to get his answer as agreed Julie must be free to choose She stood in the doorway He wanted to tell her what was in his mind but she didn t give him time She came straight to him put her arms around his neck her soft body intoxicated him His heart s desire realized Julie his wife he couldn t let her go he kissed her again and again She laughed and said in her soft sensuous voice Oh oh don t eat me It s forever Julie forever He stammered out the words He was terribly excited poor lad She grew very serious Yes it is forever Then she cried and he tried to comfort her I ve had a great deal of excitement today Go now She let him kiss her again He went unsteadily like a soberly inclined man who had rushed violently into an orgy of liquor It was dawn when he slipped quietly out of his house and dropped a letter to Martin into the post box he had written everything just how it happened The only thing that clouds my indescribable happiness is the thought that you may resent my not giving you your chance but it was out of my hands When Mrs Gonzola called me tonight I had no idea of what was awaiting me My happiness came to me I cannot let it go He expected no answer to his letter It came by return mail There is nothing to be angry about I would have done the same in your place I would take her away from you now if it were possible but don t be uneasy she doesn t care enough for me I don t think she s insane about you but you are the safer proposition You won t see me for some time Martin had a way of disappearing when things went against him Floyd read the letter once more The safer proposition Of course she would be safe with him he was too happy to let the significance of a word worry him He slowly tore the letter in little pieces and said nothing to Julie about it The next evening he went over to dine with the Gonzolas Mrs Gonzola had asked him quietly not to come during the day Julie needs time to calm down Calm down laughed Floyd It s too early for that She is quite exhausted She must get used to the idea It was not exhausting to him to get used to happiness It came natural to think of Julie as my dear wife He saw many many years ahead As they grew old they would get fonder of each other like his mother and father A pang shot through him if they were alive now He had not lived like other men he had waited for the one woman The close contact was intoxicating leaving him incapable of logical reasoning He waited impatiently for the evening Julie stood under the big chandelier her soft white gown with a touch of red velvet seemed a part of her flexible body a filet of it was drawn over her forehead Her full red lips were a splash of color in her pale face She came quite naturally to him Floyd s heart beat furiously Mrs Gonzola looked regal in black lace relieved by a huge diamond brooch set in old silver She approved of Floyd he was a gentleman My father lives with us Julie has probably told you I want her to take you up to see him Don t speak of your engagement yet Julie will break it to him gradually but I want him to know you and I am sure he will love you as we do How gracious she was it was like the condescension of a Queen Break it to him as if it were bad news Floyd felt uncomfortable Julie led the way up to the fourth floor They entered a very large room with mullion windows one at the extreme end of yellow glass He was conscious of warmth a glory of golden sunlight the odor of a hothouse many palms Under a tropical tree with enormous leaves spread out like an umbrella sat a man with a black silk skull cap on his head He was absorbed in his book He did not raise his eyes Floyd at a first glance caught the impression of age because of a long thick white beard falling in waves turning up at the edges in curls which reminded him of Michael Angelo s Moses but this statue lived Julie spoke very respectfully She seemed in awe of him Grandfather I ve brought Floyd Garrison to see you He arose and came toward Floyd He wore a long black silk coat reaching to his ankles with velvet collar cuffs and slippers His feet were very small his hands like a woman s the voice which came from that frail body was clear penetrating My name is Joseph Abravanel His eyes were young Floyd felt himself being measured and weighed but that didn t disturb him he had no secrets I know all about you Floyd I ve watched you grow up That little snowball fight with Martin twelve years ago this winter was fine You were small but you buried him He laughed like a boy Floyd sat down beside him listening intensely he didn t want to lose a word Julie flittered about the room watching them I like you Floyd you re a good fighter Oh no laughed Floyd I m a pacifist The old man shook his head Wait you haven t found yourself yet We Jews are fighters although the world says we are not We ve been fighting for thousands of years Then he spoke of the possibilities of America joining the War It will come we will be forced into it We Jews will get the worst of it as usual but that s good for us the will to live becomes stronger He continually repeated we Jews as if to impress the fact of his race upon Floyd The American aliens will find relatives in every European field of battle it will be terrible like the Civil War brother against brother Floyd had never thought of it that way The Jews are like an old tree its branches spread all over the world it roots are in the Bible The Arian education is Greek opposite to that of the Hebrew The Greeks worshipped form beauty its idols were in stone The Hebrews rejected that they based their religion on the Word You see the body the Soul the Image Greek the Soul Hebrew After that Floyd found his way often to the fourth floor He heard many things foreign to his way of thinking but of deep interest to him Now said Floyd laughingly one evening I ve made myself popular with all the family No answered Julie there is one more Father Cabello Father Cabello was an indispensable part of the Gonzola family from the Celtic help in the kitchen to the aristocratic old man on the top floor whose guest he was on Friday evenings when he shared a simple meal of vegetables and fruit washed down with a glass of delicious Palestinian wine after that a game of chess and a long theological discussion which lasted many a time until the small hours The two men of the same origin but of different creeds understood each other perfectly When it came to a burning question such as the sincerity of Paul whether his hatred of the High Priests of Judea had not instigated him to dethrone them by putting another in their place one he had never seen or whether it was an inspiration a voice out of the wilderness then Joseph Abravanel s eyes took on a fiery gleam Father Cabello seeing the danger signal would evade the question by a witty remark ending with a laugh Julie gave Floyd a hint He invited the good Father to lunch with him at the club He sat in the window watching the priest shaking hands with one and the other a man of Church and World known to rich and poor and generally beloved Floyd had a feeling of embarrassment but Father Cabello put him at once in smooth waters by a remark about the exclusive policy of the club Yes answered Floyd This distinction against aliens is very reactionary He forgot he was on the membership committee before he was engaged then he ventured to say I I am very glad you do not oppose my marriage with Julie Why should I He knew Floyd was not a Catholic why did he make him emphasize that I was prepared for your opposition on account of my religion The priest smiled The man who fights the inevitable destroys no one but himself I have had one great battle in that family I don t want a second if it can be avoided When Julie was born her mother and I together fought and conquered Joseph Abravanel a fine fellow deeply learned In the great days of the Church in Spain he would have been a distinguished Cardinal The priest puffed regretfully at his cigar His ancestors were foolishly fanatic they chose the evil of emigration to the glory of power and the Pope Floyd answered eagerly It was a question of principle they should be admired respected for such noble self sacrifice The priest liked the boy there was no complication to fight in him This marriage was a question of you and one other I chose you Floyd s face grew hot It had all been arranged between the mother and the priest Then you considered me the lesser of two evils The priest smiled again You are not an evil you are a concession we make them if they do not bring us future harm the children will be ours but don t let it worry you now Pedro Gonzola s marriage with a Jewess was also a concession Why did you allow that This boy is no fool thought the priest he took pains to answer the question We were mistaken in our calculations we are sometimes we remained passive because we were sure Joseph Abravanel would fight it with all his might and he did But another power mightier than he and the Church together won out the strongest combination in the world youth and love Ruth was his only child she threatened to leave him he worshipped her he had to give in but he went to live with the young couple with a firm resolve to counteract our influence The inevitable happened she came to us for consolation Julie was born in the church They were silent The priest lived again that interesting conflict The old man had fought well he was wonderful with his unanswerable arguments but reason went down under the great emotional rising of the soul the need of forgiveness Floyd s voice brought him back Why did he remain in his daughter s house Because with the obstinate patience of his race he had hopes of Julie s children Then he bent nearer lowering his voice There is something else you should know From the day Julie was baptized Joseph Abravanel has never seen or spoken to his daughter The atmosphere of tragedy folded itself about Floyd he felt the clashing of spiritual powers within the walls of that outwardly peaceful home now creeping like slow fire into his life Near Floyd s house there was a small stone chapel ornamented with dark wooden beams it had been built by Mr Garrison and Mr Steele They brought over their pastor from Scotland a rugged sincere man Floyd still grew chilly when he thought of the bare whitewashed walls the stone floor the hard wooden benches No choir no organ no stained glass windows The pastor generally took his text from one of those Hebrew calamity howlers and hurled curses at the heads of his unfortunate parishioners He was a man of mild disposition but he thought it was his duty to snatch them from the worship of Mammon The Idolaters would listen meekly rise sing a hymn and file out penitently to pursue on week days their ungodly practices In course of time the pastor went to heaven his congregation the other way Martin said it might be the reverse Other pastors modified their curses or ceased to hurl them the times demanded blessings and paid for them The congregation grew rich and moved uptown Floyd kept his pew out of respect for his parents He told the pastor a sensible man from the West with a large growing family of his coming marriage We are not losing you we lost you when your father died Of course you must consider the bride s family the women generally arrange those matters but I would like to come and see you sometimes Your children may in course of time think differently He also had hopes of the next generation Now Floyd pushed away all unpleasant thoughts his youth demanded happiness He went up the steps of the Gonzola mansion with a light heart humming to himself The butler ushered him into the dimly lighted parlor He waited but Julie did not come He heard voices above He was one of the family now by right of knowing all its secrets He found Julie crouched at the bottom of the upper stairs at the door of the old man s room was Mrs Gonzola on her knees Floyd tried to question Julie but she silenced him with an imperative gesture The voices of Father Cabello and Joseph Abravanel penetrating the closed door rang throughout the house Floyd heard his name it was a question of his marriage with Julie of the ceremony and again those future generations He heard the deep tones of the priest threatening persuasive the other voice trembling feeble rising in a despairing shriek dying away in sobs It was terrible every word seemed to strike that prostrate figure at the door like a whip Floyd thought of the rack The priest came out wiping his forehead he lifted the stricken woman the Church had won again They were married quietly at home the bride in old lace and priceless family jewels a vision of Oriental beauty Martin s words came back to Floyd To me she is not a modern girl she is the Shulamite maiden who rises from her couch at night and goes out to seek her lover Floyd wanted to bring his wife to the house where he was born Julie gladly consented He had been so dear giving in to everybody for the sake of peace At the door of his home Floyd took Julie up in his arms and carried her over the threshold as his fathers had done before him The young couple were called home from a brief trip by the sudden death of Joseph Abravanel Julie s grief was terrible She stood by the plain deal coffin where he lay in his shroud looking long at the marble face Floyd felt her suffering but he was powerless to console her He wondered why Mrs Gonzola kept her room she surely would want to say good bye to her father He turned she was there she entered slowly as if in fear Julie made a quick step forward The voice that came from Mrs Gonzola s white lips was red with the blood of her race I must see him You dare not Have pity on me I promised him to keep you away He will not know He will know he must rest in peace They were not mother and daughter they were enemies Mrs Gonzola turned and went downstairs in silence She died a few days later without breaking that silence Joseph Abravanel had given away what little he possessed during his lifetime to Julie he left a small Hebrew prayer book worn with age Mrs Gonzola s will was complicated She had given generously to the Church for years Julie was to have the house and contents and the income of what was left the capital going to the grandchildren on condition of their fidelity to the Church otherwise it went to support a theological seminary in Rome They were standing together in the parlor The room was icy her face pinched worn I am going to sell the house and everything in it What Sell your family portraits I ve had enough of them persecuting me with their angry faces They despise me I feel it I have felt it all my life as a child I saw them in my dreams coming out of their frames threatening me I am done with them done with them She broke into convulsive sobs She took him by the hand and led him around the room stopping before each one of her childhood s inquisitors Do you want to live with them all your life No I certainly do not but I ll have them packed up and sent back to the family in Europe who will hang them in their picture galleries We have none The sight of Julie in lustreless black and a long cr pe veil made Floyd shudder it was awful Black obscured her beauty she spoke in low tones went around on tip toe There was the silence of death in his house I can t stand this Julie We re living as in a cemetery it s getting on my nerves How long is it going to last One year Floyd didn t like to appear heartless but he had already learnt to use a little diplomacy with his wife Do you realize how unbecoming black is to you She looked at him startled It is my duty to wear it It s gone out of fashion Only old people wear cr pe nowadays a black band is quite sufficient Why should you parade your grief She didn t answer but the next morning she came to breakfast in a royal purple tea gown Floyd kissed her eyes lips hands he had his sweetheart again Julie smiled at him She liked to be worshipped Come come I m hungry Don t you want any breakfast I want nothing but you The Japanese laid the morning paper on the table and discreetly withdrew Floyd looking over the headings sprang to his feet War Julie gave a startled cry You won t go you won t leave me alone I must do my duty He went down to see Colonel Garland The office was in a whirl of excitement The Colonel was prancing like an old war horse Everybody was talking at once It had to come the President had put it off too long some were for some against it but the fact was there the United States had thrown her hat into the ring Floyd s face was flushed his eyes shining I m going to volunteer The Colonel looked grave Wait let the single men go first Floyd couldn t be held back every man he knew had volunteered He met Tom Dillon with a little flag stuck in his buttonhole his hat set jauntily on the side of his head I m going into camp tomorrow That night there was a scene with Julie she begged cried fainted Dr McClaren was sent for the diagnosis was Motherhood Floyd did not volunteer All New York crowded the streets to bid Godspeed to the first regiment sailing for France Our Boys with flowers in their caps flowers stuck in their guns marched proudly The people went mad Floyd holding Julie tightly stood on the corner of Fifth Avenue He had a feeling of depression for the first time in his life a wish had been thwarted He looked down at the curly head with its sport hat pressed close to his arm noticed the glances of admiration She was worth the sacrifice Suddenly with a well directed aim she flung a rose at a passing soldier He caught it pressed it to his lips with a long glance backward That was Martin said Julie They walked home in silence Julie had a headache from the noise and excitement and went to bed early Floyd sat up he tried to think of Julie and the future He couldn t the cheers were still in his ears the tramping of feet the clashing of cymbals He sat there out of it Love was cruel The boy was christened by Father Cabello his last service to the Gonzola family He had been called to Rome where honors awaited him for his services to the Church in America What name are you going to give him asked the Father Julie lying in her white bed answered His name will be Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison Floyd thought it too high sounding for modern times an American citizen couldn t carry it but Julie had her way After Father Cabello s departure she went seldom to the Cathedral and gradually ceased altogether I ve lived all my life under the tyranny of two religions My boy must be free of that when he is old enough he will choose for himself But she still read her grandfather s little Hebrew book at night when she couldn t sleep or when she awoke terrified from the reality of her dreams She never spoke of it to Floyd and he didn t like to intrude BOOK II The Present gray tones of actuality A moving picture Crowds struggling Shattered Ideals Truth in danger BOOK II Martin Steele came back to America after two years absence He was known over there as the Yankee Devil Danger seemed to attract him he rushed through a rain of bullets and planted the flag in the face of the enemy He was happy the straining of nerve and sinew helped to quiet an inward restlessness On landing he found a telegram from his mother she wanted him to go up and see The Museum before coming to Boston He tore up the telegram with an ugly scowl The corner of Broadway and Forty second Street gigantic waves of humanity passing moving up down across screeching automobiles emitting pestilential odors rapidly changing electric signs the only stagnation was in the air it weighed on his chest halted his breath He stood with his hands deep in his pockets There was something psychic going on within him the boys who came home brought with them a strange consciousness they had seen miracles He felt the leaden mentality oozing out from the crowd became keenly conscious of the mixture of races those tense strained faces looking straight ahead the past forgotten the future who cares We build for today the next man will build for his day The Present in electric letters of colored flames How am I to borrow or steal for women for wine Prohibition ha ha who takes that seriously who takes anything seriously Martin elbowed himself through the crowd a soldier in khaki people looked after him a fine strong fellow from the prairies seeing the sight of the Great White Way He mopped his forehead saying to himself Where shall I go He stood before the house where he was born read the black and gold sign on the door The Winthrop Museum Tuesday Thursday Saturday admission free other days fifty cents It was Friday The sleepy official handed him a card Martin threw down his fifty cents and entered There were a few stragglers strolling from case to case mostly strangers A large omnibus Seeing New York waited outside the man on the box blew the horn This is the house of the celebrated Winthrop family whose ancestors came over in the Mayflower The owners have generously donated their historical relics to the city ten minutes allowed for inspection He looked at the old furniture falling to pieces from want of repair some were really family relics but the parading of them who cares for other people s old sticks The caretaker was putting on his hat to go when Martin spoke to him I m Mr Steele I m going to close up this dugout He put ten dollars in the man s hand With one strong wrench he tore down the sign locked the door and put the key in his pocket He stopped before the Garrison home it was lit up inside He opened the gate shut it with a sharp click and went up toward Fifth Avenue The row of small brick houses were in a sorry plight On Maud Ailsworth s window there was a sign Table Board on the Gonzola mansion For Sale The mother and grandfather dead Julie married Then he bought the biggest basket of red roses he could find and followed on the heels of the messenger Floyd was in the nursery revelling in the beauty of mother and child a wonderful Murillo picture Julie laughed at his caressing epithets Two angels to take care of etc etc and all the rest a man like Floyd would naturally say to the young mother of his child She went to dinner leaning on his arm Julie was one of the rare women who become beautiful with motherhood from the first moment of its consciousness she was a changed being The grief and horror of her double misfortune vanished her eyes became larger more brilliant The dead white of her skin changed into a soft pink the rippling hair shone getting more and more rebellious escaping in soft curls about her face She gave a cry of pleasure at the roses on the table Oh how gorgeous Floyd you mustn t spoil me like this I didn t send them You didn t No my word of honor Then who I can t think of anyone unless Who She fastened a rose in her dress forgetting to answer The table was faultlessly set with fine damask The heavy cut glass sparkled in the candle light A pine wood fire threw a soft glimmer over the room there was no other light Floyd felt a sense of sthetic satisfaction He hated the big flats of the West Side with their electric illumination he was glad he didn t have to live in them The bell rang Who can that be at this hour You needn t announce me I ll go right in Martin Julie was on her feet looking for a way of escape Floyd put her back in her seat Stay where you are Floyd s hand went out to meet Martin s he d come back from the front and they had known each other all their lives I landed today I feel like a stranger in a foreign land Will you let me have a bite with you He hadn t changed heavily tanned a little more muscular a little louder He grasped Julie s hand and held it fast There was a slight heaving under the red rose her cheeks had lost their color He absorbed everything with those eyes of his She felt the loose gown hanging from her shoulders and drew it around her full bosom He turned to Floyd with a laughing question in his eyes Floyd laughed back he couldn t help feeling a sense of triumph Martin was very entertaining told amusing stories in French there was something pathetic in his efforts to please Julie took a childish delight in his medals Floyd s face clouded over Martin took them from her hand They mean nothing to me You should be proud of them insisted Julie They are a reward for bravery You were brave We read about you I wouldn t give the others the satisfaction of thinking me a coward But you were afraid at first it s only natural He turned and looked straight at her No What is there in life for me It takes more courage to go on living There was a long pause Julie arose said good night Floyd went with her to the stairs kissed her Martin s eyes followed them Then Floyd threw himself into the big chair by the fire forgetting everything but the dear woman the dear child Martin sat puffing at his pipe it was foul Julie couldn t bear a pipe Floyd had given up his then he shut the door carefully lit his pipe laughingly saying something about a bad example He was eager for more stories of war carnage murder A wonderful experience I envy you Why didn t you go I couldn t leave Julie in her condition There was a silence then Martin spoke in a hard voice which conveyed repression Your experience has been more wonderful than mine He threw down his pipe pacing the room muttering broken sentences there was a strange glitter in his eyes He cursed everything everybody Patriotism bah We punched holes in that lie sitting in our dugout waiting for the death call Love of the soil bah I was born next door another year you also will be driven out Our children won t even know the spot where their parents lived what does it matter anyhow The farmer bah He values the soil as he does his cow for what he can get out of it it isn t his land He came over bought it because he couldn t steal it mortgaged it misused it The boys won t go back to the farm They want money they ll get it the next few years The rest of the world will starve America will wallow in the filthy stuff not you nor I we re pikers that s what we are our fathers thought they left us rich I could plunge in reconstruct sell out gamble with my money and make a fortune What then He stood glaring at Floyd a desperate hopeless creature Martin s ravings always depressed him Julie s voice broke the oppressive silence Floyd bring Martin up to see the baby He stood in the doorway like a bashful boy Floyd put the child in his arms he looked down at the little dark head against his arm bent and kissed it giving Julie a look of lightning rapidity It scorched her Martin became a frequent visitor at the Garrisons running in often at inopportune moments Julie was sitting over the fire in the dining room the child asleep in a little pink lined basket beside her She leaned back there was a feeling of lassitude weariness she had every reason to be happy no woman could ask more but why that longing to get away from her child her husband from herself Why did she feel the walls of her life She knew there was something wrong with her she felt too intensely Martin Why had he come back She was happy with Floyd he was good gentle kind so different but Martin Martin She heard his voice outside she must get upstairs she went swiftly to the door too late he was in the room taking her in with those terrible eyes Why did you break in like this It s very inconsiderate I am not fit to see strangers Strangers Julie She raised her arms above her head twisting the thick ropes of falling hair trying to fasten them Her shawl fell away disclosing the corsetless form the open neck Waves of passion rushed through him Don t go Give me one moment more just one He caught at her shawl A terrible shame burnt her She staggered out slamming the door after her Martin pressed the shawl warm from her body to his face the hot tears rolled down He didn t come again for some time One day Floyd met him at the club Why don t we see you at the house We miss you Martin s eyes had a look of abstraction Your home is like a nest just now There is room in it only for two and the little bird It was a beautiful thought but that humor never lasted long with him He said abruptly I ve sold my house They are going to build a skyscraper It will take away your light Floyd s face darkened That won t drive us out Why stay there You can get a big profit I was born there I want to die there Martin laughed mockingly A man who dies in the house where he was born should be ticketed and put into a museum The wreckers were at work tearing down the Steele house Floyd passing found Martin in overalls his hair face eyelashes white with plaster dust his tongue swinging with the hammer You obstinate devil I ll show you who is the master The wall was well built too well in the old days they built for the future He gave it a blow another another it didn t yield He worked himself into a purple rage Blow after blow fell upon the unhappy partition it trembled the others jumped away it fell Martin stood triumphantly among the ruins Floyd s eyes grew moist Was there no feeling in the man Did he realize he had made himself homeless Now he must join the rich tramps the poor tramps that army of wanderers living here awhile there awhile places to sleep and eat luxurious tawdry squalid imitations according to their money value New York was becoming a homeless city He related the incident to Julie Martin looks seedy he neglects his appearance he s a forsaken wretch Julie had a sudden inspiration I m going to get him married Floyd laughed It takes two for that Julie stood before her mirror a pleasing picture flashed back A smooth young face not a trace of the physical agony she had been through of the mental agony her life was running now along smooth conventional lines a beautiful woman bending forward studying her expression Is there a tell tale line No the mask fits to the life May I come in It was Maud Ailsworth invited to dinner to meet Martin Julie was going to see what she could do Maud s mother had been dead four years she had known her only as an invalid propped up by pillows with an ice bag on her head Maud left school early to take the housekeeping which was a sorry job in her hands Mrs Ailsworth s philosophy of living was that good things were cheapest in the end The modest capital left by her husband melted they sold the house and lived on the money When Mrs Ailsworth died Maud had five thousand dollars She took a room on the top floor rear of a fashionable hotel and spent her time looking for a husband She wanted a nice man she would wait another year and then there was always Tom Dillon She didn t have to act with him He knew she was a beggar she knew he was a rotter but she wouldn t do it until her last penny was gone She still had hopes of someone better She was pretty quick with an answer and much liked by men but they didn t marry her Why She asked herself that question many a night after a party where the men went the limit There she stopped the other girls jumped the boundaries She wondered if that was why she was single at twenty five Well she couldn t it wasn t her virtue it was her misfortune She noticed at a first glance how much prettier Julie had become but she didn t compliment her It wasn t her way You have had a hard time haven t you Yes but it s worth all I suffered Maud s nostrils expanded taking in the subtle essence of violet powder Oh I smell the baby She flew to the crib and took the child in her arms You handle it like a grandmother cried Julie Why don t you get married Maud laughed mirthlessly Why Because the only man I really want won t ask me it s your fault Julie one wasn t enough for you How can you say that What are you going to do with the other insisted Maud Julie answered with a touch of seriousness I am going to get him for you if I can Do you like him Maud spoke slowly weighing her words Liking is too neutral for Martin Steele it is either love or hate I think I hate him She gave a quick glance into the mirror as they went down to dinner The men were waiting in the parlor Martin was ill at ease he felt like a waiter in evening dress Floyd wore it differently he melted into it Maud as the guest of honor was charming All laughed heartily at her frank admissions and keen enjoyment of the fruits so long forbidden We ve got a free hand Politically economically the right to work You can have it interrupted Martin I ll give you my share But we want more Moral Equality Isn t that a step backward said Floyd Until now women were supposed to be morally superior to men Why should they be Equal rights is all we want We are no longer going to be cast out for acting naturally Martin took up the gauntlet You mean you want to have children without being married Maud s eyes shot defiance Yes that s what I mean Haven t you taken that privilege I Not yet but I don t know what I may do It was getting too personal Julie arose from the table Floyd lingered with Martin She doesn t mean a word of all that She s a fine woman she ll make a good wife and mother Martin blew rings of smoke into the air I m quite sure she will but I m not interested Maud was curled up in an armchair by the fire one leg under her the other hanging down she was smoking a cigarette in a gold mounted amber holder Julie put her arm in Floyd s Let s go and say good night to baby Martin smiled at her transparent subterfuge He looked down at Maud a well shaped head correct features eyes curious the black stuff she used gave them the requisite look of the demi mondaine The glass beads around her neck were cheap what there was of the gown was evidently designed and put together by herself Her thin silk stockings were going in the seams he was sure there were holes in the feet He d like to dress her well Yes she was a nice girl he could easily be single with her for six months but marriage Julie s laugh rang out upstairs Maud was conscious of being checked up Well what s the verdict Will you let me say what I think Yes if you let me do the same You will say more than you believe I less There was something fascinating in the fellow s insolence Legs neck shoulders bust perfect the symmetry of thighs and limbs classic but you leave me cold Why She bent over with a touch of eagerness Because there is nothing of mystery about you Ha ha why should a woman be a mystery Then came a flash which revealed depths unsounded Because all holy things are mysterious when a woman ceases to be holy to man she kills love in him Maud wouldn t argue on those lines Other men don t think so They do Have you ever been inside the Museum of Art in Central Park Oh yes I ve been to the receptions Will you come with me to see the pictures and statues I ll go anywhere with you He sat on the arm of her chair You will find in some of the mutilated Grecian goddesses the same length of limbs and lines of body but they are modestly undraped Stop I don t like that expression I believe in leaving something to the imagination A man s imagination in that respect is a vile thing I never thought of it that way Think of it that way will you Yes It slipped out she was sorry at once but she didn t recall it When I look at the girl of today I feel that I am passing with the rest of the crowd before those wonderful marble statues which belong to everyone to no one She was on her feet now blazing at him How dare you demand purity in us Set the example we ll follow suit We give what we receive no more no less She made a rush for the door He caught her two arms You women You women You prate equality you d hate like the devil to have it You know you ve got the best of us Martin s voice rang out it was always too loud when he was excited The woman of today is gambling with every chance against her if she wins she loses she ll get everything she wants even sexual equality and when she has it she ll lose the glory of Life for the human race Look at me I m the average man no better no worse and the most miserable lonely wretch that ever walked in a city overcrowded with beautiful women I would marry any one of them high low rich poor if she would give me the love I m craving for Tell me the truth now can you love anybody but yourself She tried to extricate herself from his iron grasp his accusing eyes Don t don t You hurt me He released her with a bitter laugh When Julie came in Maud was hysterical Martin must have been saying something awful The Japanese announced Miss Ailsworth s car Oh Have you a car exclaimed Julie It belongs to Tom Dillon he wants me to keep his chauffeur busy She was herself again saucy reckless unthinking Martin bent over her speaking in low tones I ll go home with you we ll make up on the way She knew what he meant she d show him he couldn t love her for the moment I don t want you a man s escort is not a guarantee of safety She kissed Julie and swept out followed by Floyd He stood at the door of the car there was something wrong with Maud He thought he saw tears in her eyes He jumped into the car and went home with her Julie was at the window as they drove off Oh Floyd s gone with her He s so old fashioned he hates to see women roaming about alone at night he won t be long She pulled down the blinds put out the lights leaving only the candles and the glow of the fire Martin stood watching her She began to feel uncomfortable Why didn t he say something She was afraid of his silence Maud s a nice girl and very popular I wonder why she doesn t marry He answered roughly I m not going to marry her drop that idea will you He came close to her leaning against the side board You re disappointed I Oh no Confess He put his hand under her chin and forced her to look at him You want to get rid of me Yes I do Why Tell me In the half light her face was like ivory Her eyes shone back into his He started and put his hand on her shoulder what was it he saw there She came closer to him closer he dared not move She kissed him again again murmuring soft love words Then he broke out held her as if he would never let her go calling her his beautiful Queen his Oriental Pearl his Song of Songs She clung to him her body responding to his how long a moment which goes back centuries a century which is only a moment He felt her tears on his face as she caressed and kissed him every drop of blood in him answered I wanted you always You know it you know it I thought the longing would wear away with time my mother said it would I believed her but she lied to me lied It was always there getting more and more unbearable Martin closed her lips with a long kiss This wonderful tempting seductive creature he would never let her go I wanted you to marry Maud to save myself When I saw you with her tonight the pain was unbearable I couldn t go on I couldn t Then she drew away from him and went over to the fire her hands clasped together her face convulsed the red light enveloped her He came to her She put out her hand to keep him back Now it s over Over How little she knew him This is the end No it is only the beginning You were mine I never forgot never They stole you from me nothing can part us now Nothing She was in his arms again It had to come or I should have lost my reason it s over now Go before he comes back She slipped away from him He went out She groped toward the door where was it She was blind then she fell Martin entered his hotel it was past twelve The night orgy had commenced He passed through the room thronged with dancers his coat buttoned up to his neck his soft hat drawn over his eyes stood a moment looking on a strange silent figure out of place in that decorative humanity He sat by the open window in his room the noise from below was deadened by space into a soft humming sound Waves of icy air enveloped him He was unconscious of cold or heat In the flash of a moment life had taken on a different aspect his entire being was one great pulsation Floyd the difficulties before him the dishonor of it came faintly from a distant perspective but he thrust it fiercely behind him The woman filled the world for him he lived over and over that moment of tearing joy her face transfigured with passion her lips her tears the pressure of her body against his a statue come to life for him alone He had been tricked out of his happiness by her mother but now all the powers of Hell couldn t keep him away from her A restless night fixed his resolve He knew exactly what he was going to do He dressed more slowly than usual moving about in a kind of hushed manner he was no longer alone she was there clinging to him He jumped into a taxi and drove down to Twelfth Street The shades were lowered in the Garrison house Next door the wreckers had been clearing away the debris there was now a large open space where his home had been The Italian foreman came up to him speaking in his pleasant broken English A good job eh Everything gone clean as a whistle Tomorrow we commence to build Martin opened the gate of the Garrison house as he stood at the door his hand on the knocker he had a feeling of being mentally unstrung Criminologists say when thieves go to commit a crime they are sustained by a strong sense of fatality a fixed idea that it must be they are drawn into the vortex of crime by an irresistible fascination the lure of adventure the justification of the equality of human rights the spoils the gambler s risk Martin felt vaguely all this a sense of excitement stimulated him like strong liquor He caught his breath as he entered the room he had left the night before She was coming to him again now he would be the first to take her in his arms to hold her until she would consent to go with him he would have to coax perhaps to threaten He set his teeth he had decided it must be or he would kill himself and her The door opened he turned with a smile Floyd stood there very pale Julie is not well When I came back last night I found her lying unconscious on the ground Did she complain to you No The doctor says it s a serious nervous collapse They have shut me out of the room Can I do anything No Keep me posted will you Yes He had counted with everything but that He waited eating himself up with suppressed fury grew thin unbearable in his impatience he would have her nothing could prevent it but death The telephone rang in Dr McClaren s office The doctor was breakfasting but he didn t enjoy as usual his porridge with cream and heavy black bread made by his Scotch housekeeper his mind was elsewhere He had been up a greater part of the night with young Mrs Garrison who went off from one fainting spell into another she complained of intense pains in her head He left her sleeping under bromides she worried him Dr McClaren had lived forty years in New York a gigantic man with bushy iron gray hair and eyebrows a noble head keen kind eyes His friends had advised him to take out his papers he did and paid his taxes honestly but never voted He couldn t understand the political rings he let them fight it out without help from him Born in Edinburgh he studied medicine at its excellent severe university went to London to practice starved there five years then turned his back on an ungrateful country that refused an able doctor a living Coming over to America he made friends with some natives and liked them nice simple fellows they open their hearts to you like a grab bag at a fair everything in it is yours Medicine is a paying profession among Americans they go about with boxes of pills in every pocket Doctor my wife s just been through an operation She s nervous give her something to quiet her will you The doctor objected to sedatives when not absolutely necessary but he found the frail American woman had her own chest of quieting drugs She talked of her operation in professional terms like a doctor He wondered if she knew she could have no children He wouldn t tell her it would break her heart poor thing He soon found out she did know and didn t break her heart about it With the help of his new friends who went to unbelievable trouble and sacrifice of valuable time to show him the ropes he was established in the spacious home in Thirty fourth Street which he eventually bought it was the only permanent thing in his life His simple Americans became complicated millionaires The sands of humanity shifted from decade to decade A great city in the making left him many a time bare of patients but the winds of immigration blew them in again The tidal wave of Europe s overflow became a national industry a weird wonderful gigantic machine they put in a crazy combination of human beings and it vomited Americans The assistant put his head in the door Mr Garrison seems agitated He would like you to come at once The doctor threw down his napkin and jumped into his car the Garrisons were one of the few old families left He was very fond of young Garrison he had brought him into the world nothing like that baby had even been seen before there was a controversy about the name Mr Garrison wanted James according to tradition when it had ceased to be Jan but she wouldn t hear of anything so vulgar she named the child Floyd after the hero of Mrs Holmes last novel But said the doctor suppose he should develop into a strong individuality that name would be too weak for him He won t said Prudence He ll be like all the men of the family a perfect gentleman If Floyd s father had lived he would never have consented to the marriage Julie was a hysterical girl with a tendency to epilepsy that was a secret in a family of many secrets she grew out of it but there were always over developed emotional symptoms He was called in one night She had been taken ill at the opera the music affected her she was quite stiff he brought her to with difficulty He had a shock when he heard of Floyd s marriage He thought there was something going on between Julie and Martin Steele The young couple seemed to be very happy she was a passionate mother such mothers don t make good wives He stood looking down thoughtfully at the sick woman tossing from one side of the bed to the other He had assured Floyd it was only a nervous attack The excavating going on in the neighborhood accounted for the chills alternating with fever She was delirious for hours and after exhausted lifeless Floyd wanted to consult another doctor No no not necessary yet it would frighten the patient but I ll send for Miss Mary Floyd was bewildered Julie was in perfect health and high spirits when he left and drove with Maud to her hotel Scarcely an hour had intervened he found her unconscious What did it mean Julie was not talkative about herself although she drew every thought out of him Was there anything worrying her Could any woman have it better He was her constant companion anticipated her every wish what more could he do He sat brooding the breakfast before him untouched his paper unopened Someone was fumbling at the knocker outside he went to the door he had a vague impression of a very small person a clear voice spoke it was like a bell ringing in his ears Mr Garrison s house Yes what can I do for you Nothing I m going to try to do something for you She flew up the stairs He was a bit startled as if a bird had suddenly fluttered past him He followed her she had already thrown off her cape under which was a white linen dress She took an apron and cap from her bag quickly put them on without a mirror they sat at just the proper angles she was used to dressing in the dark Julie was lying across the bed the covering was in knots the pillows all cavities The girl bent over her murmuring low sounds like a dove cooing Floyd tried to distinguish the words You re very uncomfortable Yes I know how your head aches Oh what pretty hair It s heavy isn t it Let me roll it up for you How warm you are No wonder She flew to the windows let them down top and bottom putting a screen at the bed to shield the patient from the draught She spoke in a low but extraordinarily clear voice every syllable sharply cut A bowl of cracked ice please now the linen Don t bother I ll find everything She was already in the next room exploring When Floyd came up with ice she was changing the sheets it was the most remarkable feat he had ever seen she rolled one off and slipped on the other without disturbing the patient Her hands were tiny but flexible strong it was magic How the room changed everything in order the bed fresh and clean the patient soothed She held Julie s hand whispering all kinds of encouraging things Now I m going to give you something to eat you re hungry of course you are that husband of yours starves you She threw a smiling look at Floyd who smiled back at her She knew he spoilt his wife he could see that No I won t go away I ll stay right here She took a bottle of prepared food out of her bag which she warmed on the electric heater cooing all the time going about noiselessly on the smallest feet Floyd had ever seen A trained nurse from his experience was a loud fat middle aged woman who upset the house ate all day long and had to be waited on by the family This little fairy was so helpful so executive she knew it all she hadn t asked a question When Dr McClaren came that day he gave a quick glance around and said Now everything will be all right Floyd followed him down stairs After a short silence the doctor spoke Has your wife any worries He tried to be quite truthful Oh no at least none that I know of Then he spoke about that little girl upstairs remarking how wonderfully quick she was The doctor smiled Isn t she very young She s had twenty three years of hard experience She was born in a hospital Her mother died at her birth The lot of us took care of her the scrub woman the nurses the doctors the patients she grew up inhaling iodoform it s healthier than eau de cologne Her dolls were little orphan babies She learnt to sterilize instruments at an age when most children are being perambulated in the park She toddled after me sat on the cots watched the patients get well watched them die I could have made a good doctor out of her but she thought nursing was more helpful Her school graduates human beings The patient improved Miss Mary watched her drop into a quiet sleep then flew over to see the doctor She perched on the arm of a big chair it wouldn t do to sit in it when one is tired it was too comfortable What are you doing here Anything wrong No It s that poor man The doctor chuckled Floyd Garrison spoilt child of Fortune husband of the prettiest woman of New York s pretty women belonging to an exclusive set the happy father of a fine boy and here comes this child of the gutter and calls him a poor man Ha Ha The house is going to ruin the food spoilt the butler steals his neckties stockings handkerchiefs the cook falsifies the bills Well how can we cure that By reforming the household would it appear obtrusive I don t know but he s a nice fellow and you might try Thanks that s what I came for I want to make you my partner in crime Wretch He flung a writing pad at her which she dodged with great dexterity and flew out That night the dinner was uneatable Floyd looked helpless Things are going badly since my wife s illness Here was Mary s chance Will you let me attend to that Floyd thanked her hoped she wouldn t bother too much put his car at her disposal then followed her softly up the stairs feeling that he had managed the house very well Julie was asleep Do you think I could go to the club for a couple of hours that is if I m not wanted Oh yes go it will do you good Take the latch key and come in as quietly as possible The next morning Floyd enjoyed a good breakfast waited on by a very pretty girl in black with a dainty cap and apron He had never liked a waitress too much like a tearoom but Ellen the new maid didn t give him a chance to miss the butler she hovered around watching Miss Mary responding to her quick glances This amused Floyd Martin must come to dinner he d fire off witticisms about being under petticoat government Ellen was a girl mother her sweetheart promised to marry her but he didn t Miss Mary saw her through her trouble took her baby to Bridget the wife of a coal heaver who had seven babies Mary encouraged Bridget to go on having them but the cost of living was too high even for a coal heaver She took the poor bastard to her wonderful bosom and nursed it happy because she didn t have to dry up her milk Mary put Bridget in the kitchen Ellen in the dining room the little brat was smuggled in and was so quiet Mary was sure he knew he wasn t wanted She put a neighbor who was also under obligations in charge of the seven babies Floyd was allowed to go in every morning and sit with his wife he noticed Mary remained in the room He said the same thing mechanically every time You feel better this morning don t you The atmosphere of the sick room struck him dumb that ghostly silent creature lying there wasn t Julie He sat at the breakfast table well cooked well served There was a flutter on the stairs Mary flew in and sat opposite him giving him a quick glance Miss Mary we should have a night nurse Oh no there is no necessity of another nuisance in the house But you get no sleep Oh yes I do I hear you moving about at night Oh do you I m sorry I ll get a pair of soft slippers He went up as usual to see Julie Mary met him at the door She said in a low tone Just a minute and don t stay You feel better this morning don t you Her eyes were very wide open she was looking beyond him he turned there was nobody in the room Miss Mary was at the telephone calling the doctor The sick woman raised herself in the bed holding out her arms like a child who wants to be taken up He bent to lift her she pushed him away with unbelievable force I don t want you I want Martin Miss Mary came flying into the room What is it said Floyd She s delirious again The cry never ceased over and over again supplicating in a pitiable voice I want Martin When the doctor came she caught at him eagerly What do you want dear lady tell me I want Martin Floyd s anguish was terrible he was leaning against the door on the verge of a collapse Mary signaled the doctor who took him by the arm and led him into the next room Is it Martin Steele said the doctor Yes Send for him I will not She doesn t know what she s saying Floyd s voice was harsh He was on his feet in a frenzy of rage The voice came again louder more despairing I want Martin Do something for God s sake cried Floyd There is nothing to be done but wait The doctor went back into the room The cry continued Miss Mary came in What is it is she worse No but the doctor says telephone Floyd took up the receiver What could Martin do in that room No no Martin Martin It came again that cry it was terrible Mary put the receiver in his hand He called up the hotel The answer came Out He tried the club Yes Mr Steele was there Who is it Floyd Julie came like a shot through the phone She is about the same Floyd heard the quick gasp of relief wonderful how a wire can bear witness She has intermittent attacks of fever calls for her grandfather her mother she called your name once Mine It means nothing of course but the doctor thinks if she sees someone outside the family In a short time Martin was there Floyd went down to meet him neither spoke Floyd led the way upstairs They stopped at the door of the sick room and heard the cry of the delirious woman Martin I want Martin With a bound Martin flung himself on his knees beside the bed Julie Julie She opened her eyes heavy with fever they wandered about seeking seeking Julie She lifted herself into his arms He held her close whispering caressing words she listened her eyes fixed by the power of his soon the tired lids drooped she slept Martin felt the fluttering of her heart He had no sense of time place the world was unpeopled he was the only man she the only woman The doctor s watch registered forty minutes Mary looked at Floyd His eyes never left them his wife in his friend s arms The doctor laid the sleeping woman gently back on the pillow Martin dropped his head down on the bed helpless Miss Mary led him downstairs he fell in a heap in the chair He was conscious now of Floyd not the friend a stranger with a drawn face an icy voice What is there between you and my wife The ticking of a clock became distinctly sharp Should he tell the truth now No it would make it impossible for him to come again he would wait until she got well He put his hands on Floyd s shoulders looking him straight in the face Floyd repeated his question What is there between you and my wife What there has always been a deep affection You are trying to steal her from me How can you think that you told me yourself she called the names of others I lied She called no one but you Martin s face was telling tales he went over to the fireplace You are unjust to her but if you persist I won t come again His voice faltered his eyes filled up Floyd had never been able to resist him You two are my only friends if I lose you there is nobody nobody He went to the door then turned and put out his hand They were friends again to all appearances Mary jumped into the doctor s car and held a consultation She sat with her legs drawn up her elbows on her knees her little serious face puckered He liked her like that something was coming Well doctor said he She put her little head on the side and returned his glance She didn t smile as usual It s a psychosis The fever is not physical it s a condition of the mind I think she needs analysing His Scotch wrath broke over her head Stop that I won t have it with her this analysing has done too much mischief dragging the wild beasts out of their caverns showing the poor victims the horrors that are within them I tell you the people are playing with psycho analysis like children with dynamite they don t understand it nor do we yet Let that woman alone do you hear unless you want to rob her of the little reason she has left She s the victim of heredity we can t change that can we She s the victim of a certain physical tendency inborn we can t change that she s the victim of the errors of her ancestors we can t change that No Doctor but we all are if we knew it It s a good thing we don t Now I hope this woman s love for her child and her husband will counteract other influences mind you she s a good innocent woman but she is obsessed by an evil spirit which must be exorcised There he was the old Scotch Calvinist Julie was quiet until evening Where is Floyd Do you want to see him Yes Mary flew downstairs Floyd was trying to read the evening paper trying to be just to his wife his friend He hated to be suspicious it turned the honey of life to gall such thoughts made him ill he couldn t live with them He heard a patter patter Mary put her head in the door beckoning him He found Julie crushed into the pillows Miss Mary says I ve been out of my head Floyd was vexed Why did Miss Mary tell her that Did I say irrational things No just babbled a bit What did I say Only disconnected words without meaning She evidently didn t know what had happened Floyd smoked his pipe that night and read Emerson on Friendship Martin was to be pitied he was a lonely wretch he d give him the benefit of the doubt Mary came in to say good night Everything is all right We ll close up early She ll have a quiet night I hope The hope was not realized The sick woman had a terrible night her pulse was jumping like a frenzied thing but her mind was clear She clung frantically to Mary I m lost save me save me then she broke into convulsive sobbing always begging to be helped Mary shut the door carefully It wouldn t do for that poor man to hear Floyd tossed uneasily He was sure there was something mentally wrong with Julie he had heard of women getting queer after weaning a child He had been too harsh with Martin She had called him in her delirium that meant nothing Martin had wanted to marry her but it was all long forgotten she was his wife now the mother of his child it was foolish to make a fuss about a few moments of delirium Julie would never know about it What was that He jumped out of bed and listened He thought he heard somebody calling Martin Martin Julie s door was shut all was still It was his own imagination that cry was still in his ears He went back to bed he must get that idea out of his head he wouldn t let it become a mania with him He would see Martin often have him to dinner It was low of him to keep on thinking evil of them both The thought acted like a sedative he slept He was up and dressed before seven The night s depression descended again over him like a black veil There was a knock Mary stood outside pale agitated What is it What is it Come and see It was dark He saw Julie s figure lying across the bed she was in a deep sleep Mary opened a shutter gently He stifled an exclamation The long thick wavy hair flowing loosely over the pillow over her heart had turned white she lay in an ocean of foam What had happened to her in the night What had been at work in her brain he had heard vaguely of a sudden shock turning the hair white He gazed and gazed it was as if an artist had dipped his brush into molten silver and drawn it through every hair in her head Another long look then he went downstairs putting his hand on the balustrade to support himself Mary closed the shutter softly and followed him His mind was confused The ordeal with his wife culminating in this was too much he needed help She waited standing quietly beside him He felt her intense sympathy then he said in a low hushed voice What could have caused it It can easily be accounted for Your wife is subject to violent nervous headaches she had an attack in the night Was she sobbing Yes she suffered terribly We must be brave for her sake He looked at her standing there her eyes shining undaunted courageous Where did she get that spirit She was no longer only a nurse she was a comrade a fellow fighter her voice was like a call to arms I was always very happy he said I mean I thought it was happiness but I see now that it was like being under shelter when others were destitute that kind of happiness is selfish isn t it Yes said Mary That s why I try not to be too happy My parents were my only friends They left me I had only my wife Perhaps I wanted too much from her she was unfortunate in her family I should have taken better care I can t see ahead I don t know how this will affect her I I don t know It will be a blow but you can soften it for her I what can I do Mary hesitated Why was she obliged to say what he should have known intuitively did he love his wife Her heart would be at rest if you would convince her it doesn t matter to you what color her hair is He was on his feet his eyes averted You want me to tell her Yes He went to the door then came back Will you come with me It s better for you to go alone He entered his wife s room sat down beside the bed feeling like an intruder She awoke startled her eyes were deep with the sleep shadows of opiates Did I frighten you No but I felt someone was here Something has happened Tell me Yes Your hair What about my hair It has turned gray since last night She was out of bed with a bound standing before the mirror Let in the light He went from window to window the sun struck the surface of the looking glass dancing in and out of the silver veil that enveloped her She gave a low cry and shrunk away Julie don t grieve about what can t be helped it often happens from such headaches it s your nerves He wanted to say You will always be the same to me because I love you He couldn t It is not a symptom it is a punishment You have done nothing to deserve punishment She looked at him through him past him He didn t know her thoughts that door was closed to him I want to see Miss Mary Mary was surprised to find her patient sitting up in bed She had wound her hair in a tight coil around her head covering it with a heavy lace cap Miss Mary I am feeling better this morning I don t think I shall need you any longer Mary gasped Where was the exhausted creature of the night before the helpless invalid I m very glad Mrs Garrison Any time you send for me I will come Then she took Julie s hand bent forward and kissed her there was a slight quiver of the mouth Don t think I m ungrateful but I couldn t bear you to say anything it s unspeakable good bye Floyd was waiting in the hall when Mary came down with her hat on carrying her suitcase You are not going There is nothing more for me to do here Your wife is better the shock will cure her Then she smiled at him I m aching for the slums my cradle stood there there I learnt what life means when I get thinking too much of myself I go back and learn again He went with her to the door and held her hand in a strong grasp he could think of nothing worth saying A cloud of dust blew in their faces they were pulling down the little row of brick houses on the other side Floyd stopped in the hall to brush himself off The wreckers were working within him scattering debris He went up to his wife s room again listened there was no sound He turned the knob cautiously the door was locked There was a sense of relief he wouldn t have to spend the morning in that dark room He jumped into a taxi and drove to his club Julie gradually recovered there was a feeling of strength in her limbs a desire for movement she hadn t felt since the birth of her child it was the strength of despair One day she took out her pretty gowns and hung them one by one on silk hangers in the room next to her bedroom It had been Floyd s den he used to sit there at night during the first year of their marriage reading He could see his darling in her lace trimmed bed She complained she had no place to hang the Paris creations he bought for her he suggested putting racks around his den which they did those lace gold and silver gowns seemed to him to hang on bodies which swayed to and fro in the draught The face was always Julie s in her different moods The perfume stifled him He had an old fashioned idea about perfume his mother never used it He gave up reading there at night She put her hats in boxes her slippers stockings lingerie wrapped carefully in tissue paper in an old bureau a family relic which Floyd refused to sell it was two hours of fatiguing work but she wasn t tired She opened the door and peered out there was no one about she crept down the stairs went from room to room covered furniture and mirrors with gray linen and crept up again When Ellen came home with the boy she noticed her dark shining hair She dismissed her on the spot and rang up for the Japanese butler to come back Floyd was shocked to find the house so bare and cheerless Why have you had the covers put on again It s dusty The furniture will be ruined and we re not going to entertain He didn t answer When he saw the Japanese he asked for Ellen Oh I sent her away Why has she done anything wrong No but she annoys me she s too good looking Floyd feared his wife s mind was unbalanced she brooded too much over her misfortune He was very tender very indulgent but sometimes his patience gave out Days weeks months passed Winter came with snow ice sleet Julie spent most of the time in her room rarely going down to dinner Floyd tried to get her out for a walk but had to compromise with the automobile She d wear a hat pulled down over her eyes a thick veil a long close fitting coat and avoided Fifth Avenue The house remained covered Floyd begged her to take off those ugly depressing gray things but she sat silent antagonistic it always ended in his dashing out and spending the day at the club But his anger never lasted The pathetic figure crouching in a big chair those weary lustreless eyes hurt him terribly she had lost her beauty What is the elusive thing we call beauty It is not form it is not color it is something that pervades like the perfume of a flower in fresh earth or a haunting magic in the woods In a woman it is a living spark that sets us aglow that spark was dead in Julie he had to admit it The Image which he called by her name was blurred she would be an old miserable woman he an old disappointed man He spent much of his time at the club He d read his morning paper there He detested local politics The society column annoyed him Mrs C had run off with her chauffeur Mrs M was going to marry her riding master a well known woman was suing her millionaire husband for more alimony It was horrible to have one s domestic horrors made attractive reading he resolved no one should suspect his Then the paper would drop from his hand the green Park grow shadowy fade away he d awaken with a sense of guilt a young man dozing in his chair and all the unrest in the world He would look about furtively the others didn t notice they too were dozing One day he went home earlier than usual Julie with the boy in her arms was sitting at the window watching the workingmen on the iron frame of a building opposite they were knocking boring climbing in and out like monkeys it was fascinating She was conscious of her flannel wrapper Floyd was always well dressed well groomed his glance was like a sharp whip He took the boy from her and put him on the bed The child is heavy you must not accustom him to be carried about he makes the house unbearable with his cries It s all right to be a good mother but you are overdoing it you forget you have a husband She was on her feet facing him indignantly How can you speak to me like that You have no pity for my misfortune I m sorry if I have offended you but I don t see why you should be so sensitive about your hair You have become very neglectful you have lost all self respect I m ashamed of the servants Floyd I want to have Colonel Garland for dinner I have business with him No no I won t see him Very well It s not very pleasant for a married man to be obliged to invite his friends to a restaurant because his wife will not take the trouble to make herself presentable The dinner will be served whenever you order it but I will not come down You can do as you please about that I ll ask him for Wednesday Not so soon She was panic stricken My mother never needed to prepare Her table was always well supplied With this parting shot he went out Julie stood aghast her adoring slave was turning against her A man loves only beauty in a woman when she loses that she loses everything She was so young what was she going to do with the rest of her life She sat despairing trying to think herself out of the network of misery which entangled her She couldn t poor thing The present was a horror to her the future a blank She went back to the past lived it all over again and again Martin the joy of those secret meetings Hippolyte the side door which opened only wide enough to slip into the dark corridor there in Martin s arms The child cried she threw herself down beside him pressing him violently to her He struggled She held him tightly muttering unconsciously My body my Soul my little Martin peering into his face as if seeking something to console her These paroxysms of despair sapped her strength She was no longer apathetic but groping groping for some remedy She d go back always to those wonderful days with Martin She was religious at heart but she would have gladly given her hopes of redemption to be able to look into the mirror and see once more her young face her soft dark hair Hippolyte had admired her hair she saw him again so suave so handsome heard his exquisite French caught again the laughing significance of the looks which passed between the two men It was madly fascinating day and night it all repeated itself in her brain revolving like an ever turning wheel Martin Hippolyte Pierrot the sweet pungent odor of the place then the suggestion worked Hippolyte had often told them of his wonderful salves lotions hair restorers he might know a way to restore the color of her hair She looked up his address took the receiver in her hand a moment of fear irresolution then she called the number I want to speak to Hippolyte Oui Madame I am here His voice set her nerves quivering It s Mrs Garrison speaking You don t know my married name I was Julie Gonzola Madame I knew your voice How could I forget it Will you come and see me today at four Thank you She was terribly excited What would he think when he saw her now He must help her he must It was her last hope Punctually at four the boy knocked A gentleman downstairs She shrunk away she couldn t see him He says you expect him With a strong effort she controlled the impulse to send the man away Show him up Hippolyte looked curiously at Julie not grasping what had happened to her She was embarrassed didn t know what to say then she slipped off her cap and let her hair down It fell to the bottom of her dress He gasped and broke into a shower of compliments His admiration was evidently sincere Julie s spirits rose it was not all over My hair turned white when I was ill I want it restored to its natural color I can give you the shade Mais non Madame it is quite le dernier cri we are bleaching the hair now but we couldn t do it like this Madame Your hair will be the sensation it needs a little tonic oil and massage Then he looked at her again Madame is long indisposed Yes I have been in the house all winter Madame needs fresh air and the Swedish treatment the beauty will come back put yourself in my hands and you will see The Wednesday agreed on arrived Floyd left the house without seeing Julie he was getting used to that the entire morning she would be occupied with the boy always in a wrapper with that disfiguring cap on her She bathed dressed undressed the child like a professional nurse Floyd protested in vain On the way downtown he telephoned the house Is Madame awake yet Oh yes sir Connect me with her room will you Julie called Hello He thought her voice had more life in it than usual Julie do you remember I was to ask Colonel Garland to dinner tonight but if you are still against it I can postpone it Oh no The dinner is ordered Thank you He dropped the receiver with a guilty feeling Perhaps he had been too harsh He didn t know what to do about her he was quite helpless life was becoming unbearable Colonel Garland greeted Floyd with delight He was talking to a tall man in his private office who came up and shook hands You don t remember me Mr Garrison Floyd took in the tired face the dark rimmed eyes the deep lines Yes I do Are you still sweating blood for money No I m sweating blood to keep it Have you any left A few drops but I ll be bled white if this goes on He laughed mirthlessly said So long and left The Colonel looked after him speaking with a touch of pity and contempt That fellow made a million during the War it s been going the other way for some time and he s got a handsome extravagant wife Now if we pull down those old shanties near the river and build up big warehouses No no I m not a wrecker they bring enough for my modest wants That s just what your father said twenty years ago You re getting very much like him Floyd didn t take that as a compliment The men of twenty years ago were a century behind the times Then rather timidly hoping for a refusal he said Will you come and take pot luck with me tonight My wife s not well she can t join us I must find some congenial occupation We ll talk it over The Colonel was all animation Politics We need young men We ve got a job on our hands to rebuild the world Late in the afternoon they went to the Republican Club for a cocktail from the Colonel s private stock There were the usual jokes about Prohibition being a good law for others On alighting from the car Floyd was surprised to see the soft red gleam of the colored glass fixture over the porch The filmy lace window curtains through which the light shone were not there when he left the house that morning before he could take out his latch key the door was swung open The Jap in spotless white smiled a welcome they entered the parlor By God cried the Colonel this is something like A beautiful color that velvet Floyd smiled Mulberry they call it The chairs the sofa with its cushions were like old friends he saw again those well loved water colors his mother looking down at him and through the door the glimpse of a beautifully set dinner table a picture covered for a long time once more in the light Julie came swiftly toward them extending her hand to the Colonel She was in a state of excitement like an actress who makes her d but in a new r le Her color came and went A crescent of black plaster deepened the darkness of her eyes The despised hair revenged itself with its beauty it was mounted in shining rippling masses on the top of her head She wore a soft white gown embroidered with seed pearls a train of gold sweeping the ground Her arms and neck were free of ornament in her corsage a large red American Beauty rose At dinner she kept up a flow of small talk accentuated by soft glances winning smiles The Colonel listened as if every word were a new truth the usual platitudes taking on a mysterious significance He was sixty held himself very erect could easily be taken for ten years younger and he loved the ladies Floyd was silent trying to overcome a queer feeling Was this gracious smiling woman his wife Was he sitting at his own table Who was he anyhow The Colonel s stentorian voice with its agreeable Southern accent broke in on his confused mental condition If you will permit me to tell you how much I admire your perfect taste in dress You know what suits you an inspiration to powder your hair Oh laughed Julie it s not powdered it s natural It runs in our family to turn gray early My father was white at twenty one The gallant Colonel turned this to his credit My dear Mistress Garrison Nature has been your Fairy Godmother she has waved her wand over your head bestowing one charm more the gift of original beauty The evening passed quickly in light persiflage Floyd listening as if he were in the auditorium of a theatre At the door the Colonel gave one look back He could have fought a duel for her We haven t had a chance to talk business said Floyd Who could with such a radiant vision before us laughed the Colonel Come down to the office Floyd went back to Julie Thank you for making such a sacrifice It sounded foolish but he didn t know what to say She came closer to him He was afraid to touch her she was like a strange woman in his house That soft sensual smile set him on fire She slid into his arms he kissed her neck hair her lips she let herself be adored His love had been ideal in those early wonderful days of his marriage He reverenced his wife he was afraid to repel her He had heard of some men whose wives hated them for their lack of consideration Julie laughed at his innocence He often wondered if she appreciated being his first love he couldn t answer that now after four years He ceased trying to probe her soul he worshipped her body In the physical intoxication of the next few months he forgot all his plans for future activity Love can be a despot or a liberator Floyd was in chains again When it was known the Garrisons had come back they were deluged with invitations Do you want to go Of course what s the use of Paris gowns if I can t make the other women green She was in good humor now caressed spoilt every wish fulfilled He gave her a new car a gorgeous thing fitted up like a boudoir trying to shake off a sickening consciousness that he was buying her favors He pulled wires for a box at the opera it was an achievement to get one she rewarded him with a long kiss he developed a prodigality which astounded the Colonel You re going it my boy You re beyond your income Oh sell something laughed Floyd I must have money The Colonel didn t like the flippant answer the restless way He wasn t quite certain but it seemed once or twice the boy had been drinking He had noticed since Prohibition many sober men had taken to drink psychologically interesting the resistance to personal restraint The opening night of the opera Julie was the centre of attraction She had taken the family jewels out of the safe deposit A great cluster of diamonds set in antique silver shone on her velvet bodice of old wine a glittering aigrette in her hair which was no longer an old gray treatment had changed it into the mat silver which one sees on the head of a marble statue with life added to its charm She stood in the box in her velvet wrap Floyd took it off with a feeling of excitement He felt the sensation she created he was running a blooded mare for the first prize Maud sat in front with Tom Dillon She had played her last trump in the game of matrimony It wasn t a King now but a Knave who cared for her she was sure of that For the rest she looked into her mirror and saw her future it spelt wrinkles Who is that gorgeous creature Don t you know your friend Julie Garrison She put up her lorgnette What has she done with her hair Bleached it Catch up Maudy A celebrated cocotte in Paris has made white hair the rage she looks like one doesn t she Yes she does wonderful I always said Julie had great possibilities there s something about her that attracts men Look at Martin He was standing against a post opposite the box His eyes fastened on Julie his mouth twisted into a derisive smile the Colonel was there pouring out his usual compliments Men were coming in and out old club friends of Floyd s all eager to renew their acquaintance Julie s illness had upset all his calculations but there was one cause for satisfaction she had wanted him he had saved her she belonged to him not Floyd He was waiting for a propitious moment she must tell Floyd the truth He waited because he was not sure of her after a long siege of fever the blood cools off He dropped in one day at Hippolyte s Parlor he went there now to hear about Julie Madame was going to have a dinner party he had made a supreme effort The phenomenon of her hair had given him a great deal of thought He was in his way a scientist the psychic side of it interested him You must see her superb hair it suits her to perfection It gives the last touch of that Je ne sais quoi which she lacked It was caused in my opinion by some intense subconscious passion Martin bent over eagerly A psychic power which acts like the eruption of a volcano it tears her agonizes her she struggles with it is not quite able to translate it yet Her husband is a nice fellow mais vous savez Puritanism the narrow path he ll never deceive her nor pardon her if she deceives him That little house is no frame for a woman like her She needs life sparkle passion Voila tout During the next few months Hippolyte s mademoiselle brought now and again a deep red rose and set it in an exquisite glass vase on Julie s dressing table Julie asked no questions her eyes glistened She furtively put the rose to her lips then she d sit for hours under the hands of the French woman massage electric treatment hot cold until her body exhaled an indefinable intoxicating perfume Maud and Tom made their way to the Garrison box Julie with a keen woman s look saw at once that Maud s gown jewelry furs were no longer imitations Tom was evidently embarrassed and hung back Floyd rather liked him he was genuine he didn t disguise the fact that he was a rotter He said I m no good take me as I am or not at all What have you been doing all this time Oh nothing much laughed Maud shopping house hunting getting married we didn t announce it it wasn t worth while Floyd grasped Tom s hand I couldn t get her any other way so we called on the Judge We ve been married six weeks so far it s all right I m going to buy a house and put it in her name If I don t behave myself she can kick me out Maud was sitting in front with Julie talking over joining the young matrons and giving a series of dinners Suddenly she said Have you seen Martin Steele lately I ve been ill a long time He s here tonight Yes I saw him standing at the back He looks awful doesn t he Julie didn t answer Maud said afterwards to her husband Julie was always different from the rest of us she was queer tonight didn t hear a word I said I m certain she s not all there As they were going out they passed Martin Come with us to the dancing club Tom s sure to take too much you can help me get him home Martin went but it was Tom who had to take Martin home abusingly drunk fighting like a beast That night Julie had dreams and talked in her sleep She flung her arms around Floyd I m so glad you love me just the same Floyd was a happy man He had finished his breakfast and was looking out of the front window waiting for his wife to awaken Floyd Floyd He went up the stairs three at a time She held out her arms to him Floyd we must move away from here the street is getting impossible A crash of falling timbers next door strengthened her position Julie This is our home you know how I love it How can you ask me such a thing He was losing his temper she was on the verge of tears and last night when he held her in his arms he swore they all do at those times I ll do anything for you anything but my home is a part of me you don t realize how I love it More than me She was pouting now like a child Oh no different you won t ask me to leave it will you It was pathetic the appeal in the man s voice But I also loved my home I left it for you He was about to say It s not the same The roots of my life are here you are an alien He didn t want to offend her then he went down to see the Colonel and mentioned with much embarrassment that the street was getting unbearable Yes it s very unhealthy for your wife and child to inhale all that dust We ve secured a house Oh have you My wife didn t tell me No she wanted to give you an agreeable surprise It s on Park Avenue We ve rented it for the winter He didn t add with the privilege of buying that was to be kept secret He liked to be in conspiracy with Julie against her husband It s perfection we ve secured it with servants wine cellar everything complete Floyd went home and compromised with Julie The furnished house for the winter only he was grateful she had not insisted on going to a fashionable hotel A camp in the mountains for the summer and in the autumn when the street was built up to return to the old home Julie was satisfied with the bargain The house would be impossible shut in on both sides the walls were cracking everything was going to pieces She would never go back Floyd stood at the door of the car waiting for the bunch to come down the boy the nurse the Pekinese countless bags dress suit cases last minute bundles and Julie very much excited She had gone back for the little glass vase which had been forgotten He was physically tired mentally agonized he cast one look back and jumped into the car He had a peculiar feeling he was the automobile Julie was driving The house in Park Avenue was the very last word Floyd had to confess that The walls tinted a cold gray the light coming from invisible corners telephones a radio cabinet china closets hidden behind panels the entire floor could be made into a dancing hall by pushing the doors into the wall no fireplace very little furniture meals rolled in ready to serve by the haughty Swede hired with the house everything cooked la mode by a chef also hired with the house Julie was hysterical with joy she had been all her life the victim of antiques this was all so exquisitely modern Floyd thought with intense longing of his little home he vowed to himself he would not desert it he d go there every day and read his evening paper The house warming was to be a brilliant affair Maud with her restless activity schemed various plans for a sensational success Tom sampled the cellar it was perfection Floyd was dispatched here there and everywhere Julie sat back and gave the others carte blanche Don t consult me she said you three will do it all right On the day of the dinner Julie had been the entire afternoon in the hands of Hippolyte s skilled lieutenants He himself was to come later and give her hair the last touches True to his resolve Floyd had spent his afternoons in the little house reading his paper but he was beginning to feel a superstitious dread when he put the key in the door That day the room seemed unbearably chilly he lit the fire with great difficulty The wood piled up in a basket was damp it sputtered awhile gave out sighs as if it were in pain Soon the fretful flame died out He couldn t read looked at his watch and went home The perfume from his wife s room pervaded the house His room was on the floor above they had become fashionable He saw less and less of Julie she had no time for him she was wrapped up in herself her looks her gowns vanity had developed in her to such an extent it staggered him she sought admiration was a slave to style adopting the daily change no matter how extreme a night at home was unbearable to her he dragged himself along he wasn t jealous of the crowd of men always around her but it wouldn t look well for the husband to be absent He hadn t seen Martin for a very long time He was sure Julie had forgotten him she couldn t love anyone but herself he pulled himself up he mustn t think that way He remembered her as a girl so yielding so sweet Illness changes the character of people sometimes He must be patient with her but life had become very hard the nights were spent in carousing He didn t know what to do with his days until Julie woke up and he was only thirty He dressed and went down to his wife s door his Mecca it was open Hippolyte with a strand of her hair over his shoulder was bending down talking confidentially Floyd abominated him a man who could make a fortune out of the vanity of women was despicable but most fortunes are directly or indirectly made out of the vanity of women Floyd come in I ve such news for you I ve sold our house What house Our little house to Hippolyte You re mad Julie gave him a quick surprised look and got rid of Hippolyte Floyd you shouldn t speak to me like that before Hippolyte he ll tell the next customer we quarrel There was a suspicion of tears Julie you re mad quite mad What the devil can he do with our house He ll make a fortune out of it if he follows my advice the first floor will be a fine Colonial tea room the old furniture and our kitchen coppers will be just the thing the second floor a beauty parlor and above in your father s workshop a Turkish bath And she could sit there calmly and say such things The Colonel came in early poured out a volley of compliments which put her in good humor She whispered to him I ve won he s getting used to it The dinner was delayed until past ten waiting for Maud and Tom who arrived with profuse apologies Tom had been running all day from one shop to another trying to find a string of beads for Maud Costly things those glass beads said Tom Reminds me of the squaws up in the Reservation when I was travelling with whiskey they had them around the waist neck legs through the ears and nose and by God they thought they were in full dress When the dancing commenced Julie was surrounded she was the prettiest woman in the room and a wonderful dancer Floyd in the next room among some loose fellows was drinking heavily The sedans were not ordered back chauffeurs gossip among themselves and after twelve the guests were going slumming Taxis were engaged Masks and dominos were put on in the hall one not knowing who the other was Maud had done the pairing she saw to it that husband and wife did not meet Tom was to have Julie Maud selected Floyd he wouldn t make love to her The masked figures in dominos slipped past the sentinel at the door he was the devil who was sending souls to Hell that night Floyd wanted to fight everybody then broke down and blubbered Tom had a fellow feeling put him in a chair and told the haughty Swede to look after him At the door he got mixed up in the crowd found himself with someone in a taxi A pair of soft lips met his he shouted for joy Maudy where s Julie She laughed Oh she s in very good company She nestled up to him Don t think of her only ourselves Let s make believe we re not married The taxis were speeding downtown Julie took off her mask leaned back she was excited warm from dancing Her companion bent over her She looked into flaming eyes Julie That hour in Martin s arms she forgot her husband her child herself promised him everything This time he swore she should keep her word Floyd had an insane desire to smash things He threw a bottle of wine into the glass and china on the table overturning the electric candles the fuse burnt out putting the room in darkness He laughed hysterically He was on a ship in a terrible storm the ground was slipping away billows were rising on all sides Hey there steward damn it where s my cabin The haughty Swede lifted him like a child carried him into the elevator which took them up to the servants quarters unlocked a small door at the extreme end of the hall it was an unused room with one lamp hanging from the ceiling He put Floyd on the sofa lit the lamp and carefully shut the door he didn t want the master s ravings to be heard The caterer s men were still in the house Some might inform a raid would lose him his place When Floyd awoke the lamp sputtered in fitful gleams His head was like lead his tongue parched there was a sense of deep humiliation waves of shame higher than the ocean He looked about the room It was in disorder boxes piled up in a corner a large desk strewn with papers at the door stood the Swede Where am I Whose room is this This is a room we keep closed sir Why The master killed himself here the mistress locked the door and gave me the key she ordered me not to open it until she came again She didn t come Where is she In Paris sir He killed himself and she went to Paris Yes sir shot himself He was a fine man sir a very fine man When I came in to announce dinner he was lying on that sofa where you are the blood pouring out Floyd was on his feet quite sober now There were heavy dark stains on the gray rep The man answered Floyd s questioning look That s blood sir and this and this The gray rug was stained in dark red there were splashes of it on the white wall Why did you put me in here Because the house was full of strange people I didn t want them to see you like that Thank you I m much obliged to you Shall I bring you a little whiskey and soda No thank you I m not a drinker I see that sir said the man A cup of strong black coffee will set you all right Thank you Floyd looked about the room On the desk there was a box half filled with cigars stationery postage stamps everything just as the unhappy man had left them The Swede came in with some strong black coffee which Floyd swallowed Colonel Garland told me to give you this when you came to It was a large legal envelope Floyd took it mechanically flung it on the desk When you are ready sir I ll lock up here Floyd stood fascinated It was the only room in that big house that meant something more than wood marble The desk was littered the pigeon holes stuffed with papers the deep armchairs the heavy draperies belonged to former days the man must have had trouble with his wife about it she had put him and his old sticks in the garret The legal envelope was lying on the desk where he had thrown it He took out a typewritten document The little house was in his wife s name The Colonel had suggested it as a wedding gift It was only a matter of form it was the custom for a man to put the home in the wife s name Floyd laughingly assented What did it matter All he had was hers himself included Here it was in black and white sold on easy terms to Hippolyte at the bottom was written in her large clear hand Julie Abravanel Gonzola Garrison she had done it without consulting him she had the right The monotonous voice of the Swede broke the silence He was a very fine man sir and a liberal man She was a beauty that s her picture On the desk was a colored print of a woman in bridal costume all lace satin orange blossoms an enormous bouquet half hiding her face it was like the wax models one sees in a show window The Swede took a photo out of his pocket and handed it to Floyd This is the master I asked him for it the night before he died I was very fond of him his voice broke Floyd knew that care lined face The man who sweated blood He shivered He tried to pull himself together the horror of it struck him down He staggered against the desk on it lay an open letter crushed together as if thrown there in haste his eye caught unconsciously what was written It s over I ve made superhuman efforts everything is gone I was afraid to tell you the last time you demanded money throwing up to me I hadn t made good I told you this house would ruin us but you didn t care What s the good of a man who can t pay out I ve begged and begged this is the last time You said you couldn t be poor and there are others That s always in my ears I see now what a fool I ve been I ve spent my best years scheming for money and you took it and flung it in the air I ve had nothing from my life nothing It s too late to commence again Come back Come back Floyd shuddered He looked again at the blood stains he saw the man with a pistol in his hand It wasn t a fair exchange his soul for her body He sat in the big chair that other man must have crouched there with the pistol in his hand He had usurped a sanctuary bought with money what another had built with blood I m ready to lock up the room sir He staggered to his feet thrust the legal envelope in his pocket went downstairs and into the street The sedans rolled up and down the avenue People stepped out in front of brilliantly lit residences a happy care free crowd or were they like him a lie He moved mechanically elbowing his way through the mass of theatre goers gradually getting down into the business district quiet dark He stood before his old home huddled together as if shrinking away from the giant buildings on either side unlocked the door there was an odor like a crypt He struck a match lit the half burnt candle on the hall stand held it high peering into the corners through open doors taking in every well known detail the straight back mahogany chairs covered with mulberry velvet the tidies He could see the shuttle in his mother s delicate fingers dancing in and out of the white thread the rag rugs made by his grandmother People were hunting for them in little country villages antiquarians were reproducing them by thousands but these were his rags He went slowly up the narrow stairs the creaking of the boards used to anger him when his mother was ill He looked out at the desolate garden through little glass panes just large enough for a boy s face He saw himself again gloating over the first snow storm running down to the cellar for his sled his feet dancing impatiently whilst Prudence tied the soft warm shawl she had knitted for him about his head and neck He stopped at the first landing The old clock was covered with dust he found the key inside wound it set it right its ticking echoed through the house it seemed to him like a human thing whose heart had stopped for fright then commenced to beat again in glad relief He opened the door of the bedroom Here he had brought his bride here his boy was born here he had watched Martin holding his wife in his arms On the dressing table was a faded rose it fell to pieces in his hand He went up to his father s workshop the images took on life in the flicker of the candle light the Negro the Italian shoe boy his mother clasping him in her arms an unfinished bust of his father Rip Van Winkle with his head smashed he took it all in a life picture the background stretching out in the full sunlight of generations an old landscape He was framed in it he himself that self simple sentimental ideal old fashioned the self that was not cynical reckless material and all the things we call modern He scented the smell of fallen plaster felt the shaking of timbers the wreckers had him under the hammer destroying his foundations The table was littered with old newspapers and rags used in modelling he stood for a moment motionless like a man offering a sacrifice on the altar of his domestic gods then he dropped the candle Little flames started here there grew bigger the illumination cast a glow over his mother s face She smiled at him He shut the door groping his way downstairs at the gate he stopped to listen to the clear chime of the clock as it struck one two three There was no trace of the night orgy in the Park Avenue mansion He went up to his wife s room she was in bed sleeping quietly The soft shaded lamp which burnt through the night she had a horror of darkness cast a soft rosy glow Was this beautiful creature lying there his wife No No a legalized mistress and he a sensualist In that moment passion burnt up in him the body of love the Idol fell in ashes He took the bill of sale from his pocket put it beside her on the bed then went slowly up to his room shut the door and burst into a loud laugh The next morning at breakfast he read the press headings The old Garrison homestead destroyed by fire a total loss on account of Mr Garrison s neglect to renew the insurance Fire caused by a cigarette or cigar stump thrown carelessly from one of the tall adjacent buildings The house was a tinder box Fortunately the family had moved to their palatial residence on Park Avenue He marked the notices with red pencil and sent them up on his wife s breakfast tray He heard the maid knocking and Julie s voice saying Come in He could see her opening the papers reading the marked lines there was a loud cry and a heavy fall he went up quickly She was lying on the floor rigid the paper clutched in her hand it was impossible to bring her to He telephoned for Dr McClaren who came at once Floyd told him about the fire in a few words It must have been a great shock to her said the doctor I don t know answered Floyd The doctor looked at him curiously then went into Julie s room He brought her to insisted on her resting that day in bed and said to Floyd She ll be all right There s no cause for worry I ve seen her like that before Julie believed with all her superstitious secretive soul that her hair turning white had been a punishment for giving in to her suppressed passion for Martin and last night in that very hour of burning joy their house was in flames What did it mean What was that unseen revengeful Power preparing for her perhaps another blow a physical deformity With a cry of terrible fear she sprang out of bed locked the door stood before the long mirror examining herself closely not like a beautiful woman exulting over her reflected beauty but with the fear of a guilty soul seeking the brand of further punishment What now What now Her body was spotless like white marble with a delicate tracery of blue veins She gave a long sigh of relief The reporters besieged the house Floyd had the agony of seeing himself his wife his child in every newspaper The weeklies had colored prints of the beautiful Mrs Garrison She might have stepped out of a picture a living Greuze the grace of a French Dame de Salon the Art of Conversation lives again then the Russian players arrived Julie did not get over the shock Her nerves always abnormal snapped she sank into a state of melancholy Floyd went up to her room one morning to tell her he wouldn t be home to dinner she was still in bed crouching among the pillows Are you waiting for Hippolyte There was a touch of irony in his voice I ve sent him away I don t want him any more Then she broke into sobs Floyd was glad to get that shame out of the house Julie was beginning to mope again she needed fresh air he would look for a camp in the Adirondacks for the summer Julie brooded about her promise to Martin the revulsion had set in as usual she was again the mother the conventional wife She was afraid of his anger she must keep away from him All sorts of horrors took form in her diseased mind The clock struck twelve The boy had gone to the Park with the nurse a French girl who spoke little English they were late She saw the child run over by a car lying mangled under the wheels she was in a paroxysm of fear a distracted neurasthenic woman Mamma see what I ve got She caught the boy in her arms passionately kissing his eyes his mouth his hair a handsome fellow big for his age his eyes gleaming with excitement Mamma Mamma He took from Mademoiselle a beautiful perfectly equipped motor boat Mademoiselle explained A big dark Monsieur belhomme gave it to Joseph He said he was his Uncle Martin He taught him to float and sink it She couldn t get the child away that s why they were so late The boy took the boat to pieces and put it together again with great dexterity He was uncommonly intelligent See Mamma this is the cabin He pressed a spring which opened a little door in the bottom of the boat within lay a neatly folded paper the handwriting was Martin s Mademoiselle took the boy away looking back furtively with her French comprehension at Madame A few lines begging commanding her to come with the boy the following day She knew she would go she couldn t stay away He would hold Joseph in his arms she would take his kisses from the boy s lips her eyes gleamed She would go it would end as it must She was lost Hopelessly lost She went to the Park every day for a week leaving the maid at home the boy was always there sailing his boat One day Martin took him up suddenly pressed him in his arms kissed him again and again Julie looked on the blood leaping into her face They were her kisses Then the boy put his arms around Martin whispering I love you Uncle Martin and fell asleep Martin carried him to the car motioned Julie to get in first laid the child beside her covered him up with the rug then spoke in low tones of suppressed pain You committed a crime against me Julie That boy should have been mine All night and the next day Julie had one of those terrible headaches Floyd couldn t bear her moans of pain Dr McClaren took off his coat and goloshes stopping on the spiral staircase to admire the beautiful colored glass windows He found Julie crouching in a chair her hands icy her eyes roving restlessly My dear Madame I m sorry to see you in this nervous state What is it tell me I can t help you unless I know Is it your husband No he is too good The boy then No What is troubling you Tell me Day and night I have a terrible fear that something dreadful is going to happen I ve had it often but controlled it with a strong effort Since the night of the fire it has come back with terrible force I suffer tortures When you go out do you feel as if someone were following you to do you harm Yes yes she had her eyes fixed on the boat It seemed to have a terrible fascination for her The doctor took the boat from the table turning it over in his hands He was thoughtful puzzled How perfectly they make these toys Yes it floats and sinks like a real motor boat The suggestion gave the doctor an idea Do you like the water Oh yes Wouldn t you like to take a long sea trip to Europe for instance I would like it very much I ll speak to your husband about it No no I don t want him You want to go without him Yes He leaned forward to catch her words which came in low gasps I want to to slip away without anybody knowing If you can persuade Floyd to let me go alone you ll find him at his club The doctor dropped off at the club that day and spoke to Floyd He was sitting in the window gazing idly at the green square opposite what Floyd saw there were flames mounting higher and higher wherever he went they followed him scorching him the world was one great funeral pyre the flames were drawing him in Your wife is slipping back into the old condition of melancholia we must prevent that Doctor I do all I can When he suggested a trip to Europe Floyd gave a quick cry No no I couldn t I want her to go alone The same look of relief he had seen on Julie s face A pity married so short a time I would like Miss Mary to go with her but she is always so busy Floyd was on his feet She ll go if I ask her I m sure she will Miss Mary was at home in her little flat on the East Side of downtown The cry of a newly born child came through the window She smiled her ears distinguished the sex A girl fretted wailed in a high pitched nagging tone a boy fought bellowed Yes this was a girl Mary wondered how many men she would make miserable that would depend on her face What children men are They marry a complexion teeth eyes When they get at the woman it s too late Some kick over the traces most of them remain in harness from a sense of honor The patience married people have with each other is wonderful considering they are like dice thrown together by accident She thought of the Garrisons and drew two lines on a piece of paper one a parallel that stood for him he thought in straight lines The other broken with angles that was she She wondered if he understood that mysterious side of his wife She saw his eyes always trying to look happy his sensitive mouth trying to say pleasant things A knock at the door startled her there he stood surrounded by the bare footed little devils of the neighborhood They had piloted him up the dark stairs A little gold head slipped her hand in his He bent down and kissed her dirty face then he distributed all his small change amongst them and shut them out I ve had a time finding you Miss Mary I ve never been in this neighborhood before You should get acquainted with it it s more interesting than Park Avenue Poverty is terrible No it s wonderful it keeps people human But here there is no poverty the people earn their living Such as it is He looked around the room There was a cot in an alcove a few chairs a table a shelf of books and she smiling at him You re not feeling well Mr Garrison Oh I m well enough but the springs are giving way We must brace them up Impossible they are broken Then we ll have to get you new springs How young she was how happy and the bare room here was no ego that wants and wants always taking never giving no expectations no disappointment Selflessness that s what kept her so buoyant Can I help you Yes if you will Then he told her of Julie s relapse and the prescribed sea voyage Dr McClaren wants her to go without me he thinks it will be better for her You know her so well what is your opinion Your wife is organically healthy but there are pathological conditions a radical change might do her good She avoided his eyes he was disappointed but what else could she say He bent a little nearer Miss Mary if you will go with her my mind would be at rest She sat silent a moment I m sorry but I cannot I ve pledged myself You are engaged She laughed clapping her hands like a child To be married you mean Oh no I shall never marry He laughed with her like a boy Not if you fall terribly in love Not even then Her eyes shone defiantly I ve made a promise to myself and I won t be a deserter A promise to yourself Yes don t you sometimes No You should or life would become too accidental we would be terribly tossed about That s what s happening to me I am looking for some occupation but I don t want to get into a treadmill The people toil at business pleasure they do the same thing day after day year after year Life is a habit a deadening monotony She drew up her knees clasped her hands over them bent forward She was a quaint little thing he had never known anyone like her She spoke slowly with difficulty the words she had at her command couldn t adequately express her thoughts Life is a gift not a habit Every day we do the same things but they must bring us something new in the doing I ve often thought in the quiet of the sick room what a privilege it is that I could sit there and help when all the millions and billions of spirits are crowding the universe and can t get into life I m so glad I am put into a body so happy so thankful I have never thought it a privilege to live never thought of life as a gift We depend too much on people and things to make us happy we shouldn t Our happiness depends on no one but ourselves He knew what she meant Julie had colored his life for a time now it was grey I ve never thought of it that way She came nearer with a touch of eagerness You will won t you He answered simply Yes I will Then she went to the table and took up one of a pile of opened letters I have pledged myself to something which will take all my time all my strength and that isn t very much No said Floyd Nursing is gradually becoming a money making trade During the War women seeking adventure with little knowledge were extravagantly paid Now money is no longer easy but prices remain high Only people of means can afford a trained nurse there is a great need You don t know how sick people are neglected for want of care I am trying to bring together earnest women of all classes there are so many who want to do something and don t know how I have appeals from all over the country piteous cries from women whose lives are empty their school will be the bedside of the poor You don t know how quickly they learn when their heart is in it They pledge themselves to go wherever they are called without regard to payment like the nuns in the early days of Christianity We are getting together a fund to pay their living When they are not working they will study we will have our own home our own hospital It has only been whispered but you have no idea how easy it is to get money She showed him a letter signed by a well known millionaire who guaranteed a large sum There are many rich women eager to join us who are seeking for something better something nobler in their lives you don t know you don t know No he didn t know I feel very small annoying you with my personal affairs when you are doing such great things He made his way to the door Life was hopeless again Wait She was agitated she couldn t let him go like that because she loved him She knew it now A wave of gladness rushed through her She had loved everybody all her life but this love was like a wonderful magic touch transporting her into some distant fairy world She stood by the window he saw the light on her face I think I can manage it I want to go to London to the headquarters of the Salvation Army to Zurich to confer with the Red Cross Sisters if your wife will go with me it will not be neglecting my duty He grasped her hand Thanks thanks I ll never forget this never He saw the blood surging up to her temples receding leaving her white Her eyes were longing pleading they sought his She was beautiful his heart gave a great bound He stood looking looking stammered something then turned and went out The next few days he was kept busy about the cabins rugs passports exchange There was a feeling of warmth He saw Mary standing there with that look in her face he saw the woman for the first time How wonderful she was What a wife she would make He hoped she wouldn t marry No man was good enough He found himself thinking too much about her then he went and bought something costly for Julie He refused to stay alone in the house with that French woman He coaxed Bridget back to take care of the boy while his wife was away He wondered why Julie didn t write to her friends I don t want anyone to know I am going Not even Maud Dillon They ve moved away somewhere He hadn t seen Tom about town as usual How people disappear when their money is gone and nobody misses them The car was waiting at the door Julie with a throb of pride took the boy once more in her arms The child was beautiful in his velvet suit and lace collar You won t forget me Joseph No Mother She placed her photograph on the table beside his little bed You will say good night to me I will hear it I will say good night to you you will hear it Yes Mother She put the worn Hebrew prayer book in his hands You will read the prayer I taught you every morning every evening Yes Mother The boy s eyes fixed on her face grew deeper there was a psychic connection between them She went back to her own childhood She saw an old man with that book in his hand his face lit with religious fervor Julie you will say the prayer I taught you every morning every evening Yes Grandfather She had kept her promise The steamer sailed Mary remained on deck to get a last glimpse of the solitary man standing on the wharf Julie gave Floyd s flowers to the steward to put on the dining table there was a bouquet of exquisite red roses in her cabin When they landed she wore one in her corsage The earth was thirsty it poured down for three days a slow soaking rain Martin thought it would never stop He walked along the lake in the Park regardless of his dripping hat He was aching to see the boy again to hear him say in his mother s soft voice I love you Uncle Martin What a mess he had made of his life now he must steal what rightly belonged to him He exulted in his power over Julie Her illness was a fatality it was her mother s dead hand that had struck her daughter down to save her from him A shiver ran through him why was he so superstitious He didn t believe in anything but sometimes a peculiar feeling took hold of him there was another life far back a mystery something intangible He walked hours in the rain fighting invisible forces cursing the conditions of his life it all resolved itself back to the same determination She had promised to go with him she must keep her word Towards evening he rang the side door bell at Hippolyte s hoping to get some news of her The dark skinned valet whisked off his coat dried his dripping hair and neck and preceded him into the Turkish room behind the shop It was Hippolyte s hour of rest before the night s activity he was lying on a divan a picturesque figure in a loose red silk robe He waved Martin a welcome with his small white hand the diamond set in platinum on his finger flashing rose color in the soft electric glow of the pervading red Sapristi Monsieur Steele I was thinking of you Martin dropped down in a deep chair stretched out his legs The aroma of coffee and a whiff of perfumed opium lent a sense of warmth to his chilled body Of me Are you in trouble again His pipe dream visions changed into the cold reality of a check book he had often helped the man out of his financial difficulties he earned enormous sums but the overhead expenses were fabulous The money is nothing it comes in and goes out like the tide I am at the end the compass changes We must in Life watch for the Warning We must train our ear to detect the direction of the wind You are superstitious We all are if we knew its true meaning Superstition is an intense sense of the Invisible Martin drank the strong Turkish coffee puffing at his chibouk The man was a hairdresser but that didn t matter Martin had no sense of class My time in this business will soon be over I was the only one for years when it was an elite profession Now it is vulgarized like everything else There is a clever Russian woman who is taking all my customers do you know why The husbands are jealous Martin laughed he understood that he would never allow this fascinating purring Greek to maul his wife about Mon ami I know what you are thinking you are wrong They talk a great deal about the immorality of the American woman It is not so and it is a shame that it is not so The French woman is honest she have her husband her lover he has his wife his mistress Marriage is a success in France they do not go about divorcing themselves Here marriage is a failure because every woman young middle age old talk of love it is only talk mon ami talk talk but she do nothing nothing Why because she is afraid the fear is in her blood from the old times in America the fear of the Scarlet Letter Oh she can love Mon Dieu and if by accident there is just a little false step she make a scene her relatives make a scene the press make a scene everybody make a scene Oh your Hawthorne did not know what harm he was doing to the future women of his country The French authors knew better La nouvelle Heloise Camille the heroines of de Maupassant have set the women of France a glorious example Martin smiled The fellow was clever insolent Do you know how it will end No my imagination doesn t take me any farther Bah it is easy she will go back to the pale face and the straight hair You will see the little Puritan again They have already forbid us the wine the splendid opium the tobacco silk stockings cosmetics love the whole nation will go to bed at nine o clock and their money will choke them Martin laughed but the man was very serious he put his hand on Martin s shoulder Mon ami you have been good to me You know the Figaro has the soul of an artist I am going to be good to you I am going to tell you something you do not know Mrs Garrison will sail Saturday for England without her husband The Garrison shanties near the river were kept in as good condition as possible but time and rats gnawed at their foundations On one of these the passer could read with some difficulty the faded letters of an old sign Martin Steele and Son Established Since Mr Steele s death the business had been carried on by a Mr Waldbridge who knew and followed the old conservative methods of the defunct Steeles Young Mr Steele was expected to take his father s place as head of the firm but he stayed away took what money he wanted a ridiculously small amount for a man of his means leaving the surplus in the business Waldbridge had written several times asking him to come down and look over the books Finally he appeared He was a mystery to Mr Waldbridge all the young business men of the day were eager speculators He had expected new ideas a business revolution but no such things happened He would sit about watch closely the proceedings but made no suggestions His visits grew less and less frequent What does he do with himself thought Mr Waldbridge He doesn t gamble He s never seen at the races or baseball games His name has never been connected with women What kind of a man is he Martin sat opposite him in the private office flung his soft hat on the floor crossed his long legs his hair was disarranged his face a yellow pallor his clothes hung loosely he was very thin His appearance struck Mr Waldbridge as very un American he himself being an Erie Road commuter with all the proud consciousness of a one hundred per cent Nationalism He spoke cautiously of the hard times and unsatisfactory business conditions They had advanced money on large stocks of merchandise there was nothing to do but to hold on If they forced the sale it would mean enormous losses Yes I know interrupted Martin impatiently We couldn t go on gorging money at that rate we d have to vomit it up sometime No stomach could hold it that s what we re doing now Some people die suddenly from it we ll have a lingering end Waldbridge laughed uneasily really a very unpleasant young man I hope we will weather it I ve been discounting and Martin interrupted again discounting meant nothing to him although he was flying some moral kites on his own account Do whatever you like I m out of it Waldbridge rose to his feet What do you mean You can take my father s name down If you liquidate the business now it will mean disaster I have no interest in it I am leaving New York Then Waldbridge broke down It was terrible a long established respected firm wreckage pure wreckage that word seemed to have a fatal significance in Martin s life Can I count on say ten thousand a year for ten years Julie was luxuriously inclined because her heart had been empty He would take her away from cities they would live somewhere quietly in the country Waldbridge smiled You can always have that and more if you want it Then Martin did a wonderful thing so wonderful it left Waldbridge speechless staring at him Was the man mad There was a taint of insanity in the family Martin read his thoughts I m thirty two years old and I know what I am doing I want you to turn this business into a company every man in it from the lowest to the highest must have his share You of course will be the head of the firm Get a good lawyer and do it legally You ll have your work every mother s son of you to get the old hulk out of the mud if you do you re entitled to the spoils And the capital gasped Waldbridge I told you what I want the rest I ll leave in business you can t go on without it can you No Then what s the use of talking about it He held out his hand Waldbridge grasped it trying to stammer out his gratitude but Martin was gone He dashed out of the place threw himself into a taxi Uptown The New York chauffeur is accustomed to indefinite addresses He looked back at the man with his hat pulled over his eyes crouching in a corner A bloke who had lost his wad Then he wondered if it was a defaulter or a gunman some of them looked like perfect gentlemen He drove uptown entered the Park There he stopped He was hungry that guy in the corner could sleep all day Where to Martin pitched forward by the sudden jolt glared at him The Waldorf He sprang up the stairs three at a time too nervous to wait for the elevator looked around the room which was in disorder his man couldn t keep it tidy Martin flung everything about He would take nothing with him but a dress suit case He caught sight in the corner of an old box covered with deerskin tied together with a thick rope he had taken it from the garret after his grandfather s death but had never opened it He untwisted the knots one after the other It was a hard job It hurt his fingers He took out a pair of mountain boots goat s leather with large nails in the soles Martin looked down at his feet they would fit him He pulled out an old woollen shirt a pair of corduroy trousers a felt hat with a green feather a bright colored vest and red handkerchiefs There was a small chamois bag with strange coins Swiss money Martin examined them curiously a pack of old letters a photograph of a young boy and girl a cow and a high mountain at the back That mountain fascinated him he looked at it long intensely The raw boy and girl in Swiss dress were his grandparents Martin thought of his mother On the back of the card there was something printed which he made out with difficulty Val Sinestra He had never heard the name He put everything back in the trunk and roped it the idea came suddenly he would take it with him to Switzerland After Julie left Floyd spent his evenings at the club there were many strange to him The membership had increased it was still a mark of class to be seen lounging at the club window in the afternoon He missed Martin He was different from the others When he raved against the world he said things in bad taste but often the bitter truth With a sudden impulse he wrote a few lines asking him to lunch at the club the following day He d be furious when he heard Julie had sailed He d say You might have given me a chance to send her a few flowers Floyd smiled yes he liked Martin more than that he loved him he was interwoven with the memories of his childhood his youth He wished that episode had not happened when Julie was ill but she was unconscious of it She had never in all that time mentioned his name It was all in his own evil mind He mentally asked pardon of Martin The next morning at breakfast he had a feeling of agreeable expectancy The boy was crying upstairs Bridget couldn t quiet him What s the matter up there The child fretted for his mother He had caught a cold and had been kept in the house for some days He was standing with his boat in his hands sobbing piteously Floyd pacified him by running the water into the bath which was sunken in the center of a tiled room The boy handed his father the boat Floyd turned it over in his hand A costly toy Mamma is good to you Mamma didn t give it to me Yes she did Mamma gives you everything She didn t insisted the boy My Uncle Martin bought it for me Your Uncle Martin Yes He came every day to the Park and then he put a note in the cabin telling Mamma to come and she came Where is the cabin You can t find it nobody but me The boy in great glee pressed the spring There s no letter there Oh no I gave it to Mamma she read it and tore it up Floyd pushed the boy away He was making a spy of his innocent child Why didn t Julie tell him Did Mamma meet Uncle Martin in the Park every day No not every day she d stay away sometimes because Uncle Martin scolded her and she d cry He loved me and petted me and said he was going to steal me away But you wouldn t leave me would you Joseph The boy meditated and then told the truth Perhaps I would Papa if Mamma came along but I don t think she d come because Uncle Martin scolded her too much I was mad at him and said Uncle Martin you ll have to beg Mother s pardon I always do when I m bad Then Uncle Martin laughed and gave me such a long kiss and said There take that to Mamma and it will be all right Floyd sat motionless with the boy in his arms The little fellow s eyes drooped he slid down pillowed his head on the big fur animal those glassy eyes brought Floyd back to Mrs Gonzola why did she always watch Julie He had never asked any questions about the unexpected call on the telephone He had been deliriously happy there was no room in his thoughts for the past He bent over the child noting the beautiful powerful body neither he nor Julie had great physical strength The boy would be a giant Why did Mrs Gonzola press such a quick marriage Why did she keep him away so much during their short engagement Why did she want Julie to get used to the idea As a child Julie liked Martin better they d disappear and he d wander about looking for them then go home disappointed In his mad desire to get her he had really done Martin an injustice he should have waited He didn t do the square thing because he knew Martin would have won out He bent lower over the boy trying to find some clue in that innocent face The blood rushed to his head he must have it out with Martin he couldn t go on with evil suspicions of his wife his friend Martin was no liar He always told the brutal truth even if it were against himself The night brought sanity consolation Julie was foolish but not criminal Her religion wouldn t let her do anything wrong She went to Confession the day before her marriage then he wondered what did she really believe She was by creed a Catholic but she taught her boy his prayers in Hebrew He went early to the club and waited for Martin who was late as usual He looked at his watch and idly took up the morning paper His eye caught a headline The Aquitania sailing with a distinguished crowd on board What the ship already back and sailing again It was the usual summer rush he knew most of the names One riveted his gaze He read it once twice three times the paper dropped from his hand He saw that name wherever he looked Martin Steele had sailed on the Aquitania It was ten days before the next steamer crowded with pleasure seekers sailed for England At the last moment Floyd came on board too late to have his name in the passenger list The only cabin left was on the lowest deck inside He went down locked the door unpacked his valise Most of its space was taken up by a silver mounted leather box one would say an elegant toilette case He opened it took out a brace of shining pistols examined each one carefully and put it back in the box He had no definite plan but when a man catches a thief in his house he shoots him Martin arrived in London and put up at the Savoy he noticed the crowds of fine young fellows and beautifully dressed women Is there anything unusual going on tonight Yes said the polite young clerk a dinner and dance in honor of Mrs Garrison an American lady Julie had been received by the Ambassador in London with great cordiality on account of his old friendship for Jimmie Garrison Mary wrote to Mr Garrison You have all reason to be well satisfied with your wife We have done the right thing She is enjoying herself She looks like a young girl the element which disturbed her has disappeared I find her so much more normal The letter never reached Floyd Martin stood in the doorway his eyes fixed on Julie who was surrounded by eager applicants waiting their turn to dance with the silver haired beauty He took in the soft white neck the dimpled arms the small classic head and that something in the curve of her mouth and yielding smile a triumphant sensuality She swept past him He could have touched her he stood motionless Mary was up early the next morning She stood looking at Julie in a deep sleep her hair falling loose enveloping her in a veil of unreality then she shut the door softly and went into the salon Waiting for her simple breakfast she watched the passing busses and pedestrians in the street below All large cities are the same but different like people each individuality giving another form to the Image or material symbol London has a distinct personality nobility of character is unmistakably stamped upon it The door opened she turned and saw Martin There was a momentary fear then she was her quiet self again Martin apologized for startling her They measured each other he saw an enemy Why are you so antagonistic to me I m never antagonistic without reason What reason have I given you She looked keenly at him He was well groomed a clean shaven intense face fascinating for some women he repelled Mary He has courage to show his mouth she thought I have been sent here by Mrs Garrison s doctor she has had a serious illness you know that Yes She may at any time fall back into the same condition I don t want her to know you are here Why There was a gleam of humor in his eyes it angered her Why should she play policy with him Because your presence may excite her You are Mr Garrison s friend I hope you will take my advice and not try to see her until she has finished her cure What cure She has been sent to a place in Switzerland called Val Sinestra to drink arsenic water you see I am keeping nothing from you Very kind I could easily find out Val Sinestra The name was familiar She stood with her hand on the door knob waiting for him to go Val Sinestra I will write her I have orders to withhold any communications which may excite her Orders from her husband No from her doctor Her eyes shot fire at him He went back to his room took out of his bag the bundle of old letters Yes that was the name Val Sinestra it was Destiny There were two sides to Martin a fiercely brutal realism and a mysticism instinctively concealed As a boy he would lie night after night his eyes wide open visions came and faded It was always the same struggle with an unseen horror He would awaken from a restless sleep his face damp with tears Those days he was very silent his stepmother called them his sullen fits As he grew older the visions vanished but he had hours of deep abstraction when reality slipped away from him He sat in his room the banal colored post card of the two young peasants in his hand There was a sudden consciousness of Liberation the other self flew out and away through walls over seas over mountain peaks soaring soaring He sat there for hours motionless That evening the hotel clerk handed Miss Mary a note It contained one line scrawled on half a sheet of paper Am leaving for Paris She was very glad she wondered how far it had gone between those two The responsibility was heavy At thirty two Martin put his foot for the first time upon the soil of his ancestors He roamed through Zurich mounted its narrow cobble stoned alley ways stood before an overhanging house reading the inscription This house is three hundred years old The lives of Zwingli Pestalozzi became familiar He read ravenously the history of the town He stood on the border of its blue lake encircled with snow mountains A Turquoise on a white bosom Something stirred in him an inward convulsion like the sudden eruption of an extinct crater he broke into choking tearless sobs Martin unknown to himself had the Swiss temperament a people without the gift of self expression a deeply religious peasant race silent before the mystic beauty of their mountains Patriotism that misunderstood word with its medieval clashing of swords its uniforms its medals has no relation to the Swiss adoration of the soil He worships his valleys his lakes his waterfalls they are living to him he has a rage for the mountains he leaves his country to seek wealth but he rarely stays in the stranger s land nostalgia drives him home he must get back to the heights or die Martin understood later why his grandfather went mad why his father was wordless why his mother died young He tried his Swiss on the portier of the Bauer au lac Hotel a man of all round information a veritable encyclop dia of Switzerland who could answer in the many languages of the cosmopolitan crowd on its way to and from the mountains Martin spoke a few words to him in his grandfather s lingo then said What am I speaking anyhow Your dialect is Romontsch or Romance Your people came from the Grisons Then he explained how in the Middle Ages the Barons and Bishops had oppressed the people and how they formed Leagues and fought for their freedom The Grisons took their name from the Gray League a heroic band of peasants Martin left Zurich by the early train the next morning he sat the entire day gazing out of the window unconscious of the other passengers A great moving picture shot before him green valleys velvet hills beautiful grazing animals brooks changing into waterfalls cataracts dashing down dark ravines mountains growing higher higher At Tarasp he stayed over night to connect with the stage coach at daybreak and spent the evening sitting outside with the guides who told him of the Val Sinestra where the bandits used to live in caves deep down in the ravines and smuggled wine over the border Then they spoke in lowered tones of the danger of mountain climbing of death of miracles they had seen above in the mist with their own eyes With the rising of the sun seated beside the coach driver Martin pierced the mountain passes they stopped at a quaint hamlet We turn here said the old man Then he wished Godspeed cracked his whip and went on The coach pitched from side to side on a perilously narrow road but the horses were sure footed and the driver past seventy had gone the same way for fifty years Martin drew deep breaths of the fragrant air he looked about him The houses were a mixture of old Swiss and Italian architecture the protruding windows and little balconies were covered with bright flowers in the distance he caught sight of a picturesque church and cemetery He entered an inn with a swinging sign a rooster flapping its wings The spotless floors sprinkled with sand the small counter with shelves of bottles the peasant girl in the costume of the Canton it was all so familiar She brought him a glass of wine and a pretzel smiling at his jargon He remarked on the absence of men They are up there with the cows for the summer She pointed to the green hills gradually becoming steeper In those little huts on the top they make the cheese which they send all over the world In the winter the sun doesn t come up very high it is like a blue twilight here The storms howl the snow falls for weeks When the peasant closes his eyes the avalanche haunts him if he awakens in the morning he is grateful to God The girl went on chattering in her soft Romance The doctor goes down to Croire in the winter but our pastor stays with us We have service here when the snow is too deep to walk to the chapel Then she put down the glass she was polishing and went joyously to the door to meet a tall man a gigantic peasant with masses of thick gray hair falling to his shoulder He was long past seventy but showed no signs of age His voice rang out stentorian clear He was warm wiping the perspiration from his face with a large red handkerchief He looked at Martin with keen penetrating eyes Then said Good morning Oh you speak English Yes we have many English visitors Our children are taught it in the schools He looked again seemingly puzzled What is your name Martin Steele My people come from over here Steele He shook his head I know none of that name Martin took from his pocket the bundle of old letters One glance at them and the pastor s arms were around him I wrote those letters to your grandfather I am his brother You are not an American you are a Swiss Your name is not Steele it is Staehli Martin Staehli The eldest of our family for generations back was always Martin Martin felt a throb of joy the blood of this fine old man with the head of a Roman ran in his veins He had known only Aunt Priscilla whom he wanted to burn Come I am going to take you home with me Martin looked back at the Swiss Madel In her red skirt and velvet bodice an image of national womanhood They walked together down the hill through the fields past the little chapel and cemetery where they stopped On the headstones he read again and again the name Martin Staehli He would bring his grandfather his parents and lay them where they belonged and he would lie there beside them The pastor looked up at the great mountain already casting a shadow over the valley even in summer the day was short The night came early and lingered We are not all here My son was the best guide in the Canton He was lost in a snow drift up there At the ch let with its black beams centuries old still strong unyielding he put his hand over Martin s head and blessed his entrance into the home of his fathers Martin stood in the long hall vaguely conscious of atmosphere A cuckoo sprang out of an old clock chanting the hour a spinning wheel with threaded flax new linen piled up a living thing that wheel it clothed the people Carved chests plaques of fruit birds cut out by the natives when the country was Italian everything in the room bearing witness a living story teller of the lives and times of the vanished family For the first time he felt the antique He was swayed by a kind of psychic storm like a rush of wind through the pass of a mountain The pastor at the door called Angela Angela A clear voice answered she came down the path a girl of sixteen with bits of hay in her flaxen hair a child like look of wonder in her blue eyes and something more of mystery Martin thought of Joan of Arc in the orchard On seeing Martin she gave a quick impulsive cry The pastor put his arm around her What frightens you Angela It is my brother Martin s son from America Angela extended her hand but her warm radiance had vanished Come out in the sun it is cold here She brought mugs of thick yellow milk brown bread delicious chipped beef then went again into the field and sat sorting out leaves from a basket The pastor followed Martin s gaze which lingered on the girl she appealed to his artistic sense Angela is a wonder child she is not of our family I found her one moonlit winter night in a snow drift a white angel Since she came the village has prospered the people are happy Martin smiled probably the child of some unfortunate village girl The pastor read his thoughts She belongs to no one she is a miracle child You don t believe in miracles No Then why are you here A simple question difficult to answer He couldn t express the longing which from childhood had made him restless unhappy a longing for some other space some other element He couldn t explain his agitation his unbearable joy when he saw those scenes of which his grandfather had babbled in incoherent broken bits He answered conventionally I wanted to see the place where my grandfather was born The pastor grew very serious It was not a case of idle curiosity you were drawn here Angela knew you were coming I used to tell her stories of your grandfather Martin Staehli He was queer had a streak in him of evil He got into a brawl with a guide and killed him he had to leave the country I never knew that said Martin That s why he changed his name I wrote to him often but he seldom answered Poor Martin he got very rich Martin laughed bitterly That almost uncontrollable instinct to destroy was his inheritance Angela said the third generation would return home She has the gift of prophecy and of healing She cures the people of their ills The cattle run to her for her herbs there is a magic in them She brews them with Prayer with Love Martin shook off a peculiar feeling it was all superstitious nonsense an insult to a man s intelligence He rose to go You will stay here with us I m sorry but I must meet some friends Where is the Val Sinestra Hotel A little distance from here on the other side of the hill beyond the hay field Martin looked up at the straight stony walls of the big mountain I m going to climb that mountain he said The pastor smiled Perhaps when you have had long practice a man must train himself to climb The pastor watched him as he went with quick uneven steps stumbling here and there he had no equilibrium He d never climb that mountain Angela was also watching Martin The pastor put his hand on her shoulder she started He terrifies me I am afraid of him She threw herself sobbing into the old man s arms The pale women were coming up from the Springs where they drank the arsenic water with a prayer for red corpuscles strength beauty The Spring of Youth was in a cleft in the mountain a dark mysterious fountain of gushing water unlit by the sun Martin paced his room in the hotel She was there arrived two weeks before the cure was nearly over The madness came back now he had been free of it for a few hours It was like the relapse of a fever violent vicious raging He had waited too long for her with stupid patience and more stupid scruples He heard Julie s voice downstairs he went to the window She was standing on the terrace talking to Miss Mary who was leaving She kissed Julie jumped into the hotel omnibus and drove off Julie stood a moment waving her hand then turned and entered the house He heard her voice outside in the corridor speaking to the maid The next door opened her room adjoined his The Sun God sinking slowly behind the mountain scattered an orgy of color Julie stepped out on her balcony There was a low railing between them He jumped over Julie She started with sudden fear fled into the room He followed tried to say something stood speechless looking at her She was wonderful The force of the rich blood surging under the white skin swept him like a cyclone There was a new intensity of life in her quick flashes of passion in her eyes She gave a low cry threw her arms out trembling with uncontrollable joy You You She kissed him again and again How she kissed him then drew him outside Come come The sun is setting it was too wonderful I couldn t bear it alone His eyes held hers I saw Miss Mary driving away Yes she has gone to Tarasp to visit an old patient she will be away until tomorrow afternoon A shadow fell it was twilight You must go now He tried to hold her she slipped out of his arms shutting the long windows after her He went back to his room Those fleeting moments made him eager desperate The night was coming on they were alone together at the end of the world Miss Mary sitting in the train was troubled She opened a telegram and read it again Meet me at Tarasp Say nothing to my wife Floyd Garrison The little parlor of the hotel was filled with guests assembled there as was the custom waiting for the dining room doors to be opened Martin standing in the hall a living symbol of electric force created a sensation He drew nearer and took in the crowd of pale women young nervous with mysterious ills they could not or would not explain to their doctor who for the lack of a suitable name called the sickness an mia He looked them over with an experienced man s compelling eyes Some were very good looking would have been beautiful under favorable conditions but they were pale with white lips and drawn features like plants in a dark cellar pining for the sun He became amusedly conscious of being the only man he finally espied in the garden a rheumatic old fellow like the decayed trunk of a tree He felt a battery of admiring glances leveled at him He smiled went to the foot of the staircase waited for Julie They went in to dinner together The table in a deep window at the far end of the room was decorated tonight with an abundance of flowers Martin played with his food he was too excited to eat but he was in wonderful spirits Julie had never seen him like that she had a feeling of triumphant elation He was handsome the other women were envying her He laughingly remarked about the Eden with one Adam and many temptresses They are all so white as if frozen in ice the Sun God should come and melt them He squeezed her hand under the table I am sorry for the good women They sacrifice themselves for an illusion chastity She answered quickly The woman doesn t think so It is her religion It may mean nothing to you but for her it is a spiritual compensation Oh that s Catholic laughed Martin She shivered drew her cape around her Then he said Look how beautiful The twilight is wonderful up here light mixing with darkness like two souls How the valley stretches out Do you hear the rushing of waters They are saying Give me your body I will heal you Look The mountain has a halo of red it catches at my throat and chokes me He was poetic inspired He raised his glass The wine goes through my veins like warm blood If I were a doctor I d prescribe it for the ladies Oh oh laughed Julie forbidden fruit And you There was a laughing question in his eyes I m cured She drained the glass After dinner they walked up and down the terrace in front of the hotel like old friends who had not met for some time and had much to say to each other Gradually the buzzing inside subsided the pale creatures evaporated lights were put out one glimmered in each corridor He drew Julie into a small summer house covered with vines at the end of the garden The head waitress brought in wine He thanked her the Swiss know the hotel business He slipped his arm under Julie s cape She resisted but he held her close She could hear his heart beating violently Then it seemed as if it stood quite still but it commenced soon to hammer again against hers I must go in she whispered They close the house early She put her arms around his neck raised her face to his How dark it is Yes It s always so before the moon comes up Then she slipped away He caught her back Will you give me a signal It was a moment of suspense Yes He looked up at her room there was a candle burning in the window When you put out that light I ll come He reluctantly let her go She went up the stairs he saw her at her window There was a white spirit also watching the moon that Orb d Maiden chaste as the sleeping women within Only those two were living with them it was Flood Tide The light in Julie s window went out It was dark now the moon ashamed had turned away her face He started to go his feet were lead his body weighed them down What ailed him He shook himself like an angry beast Martin don t go The voice was low but very clear did it come from without or within He didn t know Martin don t commit this crime don t rob your friend If you love the woman do not destroy her it is one throb more one desire fulfilled and then the Price At daybreak the gardener crawling about found the stranger in the summer house his head on the table buried in his arms He looked at the empty bottles The wine of the Canton was strong he shook the sleeping man once twice Martin started up where was he The hotel was empty The guests were at the Springs A bath of mineral effervescent water refreshed him but that strange feeling came again like a dream which returns in fitful flashes fragments of color impossible to blend He paced the room his eyes fell upon the deerskin trunk he had brought with him He opened it took out the corduroy trousers boots shirt examined them critically His valet had pronounced them only fit for the ash can but that didn t influence Martin He had them cleaned folded and put back into the box He drew on the soft leather boots they fitted him The woollen shirt was light and warm Looking at himself in the glass he saw a man of the mountains real living If a man buys a costume like that it is only a masquerade this was his inheritance The omnibus came back from the Springs he went down and helped Julie out seeking in her face the reproach he deserved She smiled at him how sweet of her The fact was when Julie reached her room the usual revulsion of feeling set in She undressed quickly dropping her clothing in a heap on the floor blew out the candle There was a dark form below waiting she stood breathless her hand on the knob of the door Then she turned the key crept to the window pushed the bolt She was securely locked in she slipped into bed This morning she looked very girlish in a sport suit the short skirt grazing the tops of very high tan leather boots A soft hat pulled down over one eye gave her rosy face a touch of diablerie She was all animation joking about his Alpine costume casting roguish glances at him but he felt the undercurrent of emotion He adored her We are going out for a day in the woods You don t ask will I go No but you will won t you There was pathos in his voice longing she couldn t resist him Yes but I must rest after the bath and dress lightly The morning here is cold at noon it gets very warm He bent down and whispered Wear white like a bride During the interval of waiting Martin studied a map of the Canton tracing lines from one Dorf to another short walking tours through the woods there were plenty of little inns where they could rest He paced the terrace impatiently She came all in white A filmy scarf wound around her head la turque accentuated the Oriental in her She laughingly drew the long floating streamers across her face her eyes shot fire through their soft transparency A little wagon drove up the peasant boy cracked his whip and they started off The road was smooth sunlit They stopped at the Springs where Julie made him drink the unsavory water to clear his complexion They were in high spirits laughing at simple things like two children When they reached the chasm the road became steep narrow with dark overhanging trees Martin drew Julie close to him a mysterious something hovered about them intangible in its beauty penetrating wonderful The driveway ended there The descent into the ravine must be finished on foot The lad took a basket from the wagon and set it on the ground then he cracked his whip and drove off At the Savoy Floyd heard many flattering things about his beautiful wife He was silent kept turning over the pages of the hotel register finally found the name he was looking for Martin Steele New York Then he wired Miss Mary and left at once for Switzerland made quick connections arriving at Tarasp toward evening The stage coach from Val Sinestra was expected He paced up and down before the hotel his thoughts stinging like a swarm of bees He had married well he was a happy man in the world s vocabulary Happy A man who marries Beauty lives on a powder mine The something which compels adoration makes a woman unfit for matrimony A man can t always be on his knees that s very well at night but he becomes a ridiculous figure in the daylight The coach shambled up the road Mary was the only passenger she nodded and smiled at him He helped her out Were you surprised to get my telegram Yes You understood Mary waited She wasn t sure how much he knew He spoke again excitedly Why did Dr McClaren send my wife to Europe without me Mrs Garrison wanted it there was no peace for her with that man so near He was watching her keenly Did he think she was in collusion with his wife against him Her face burned she looked straight at him Mr Garrison it was an experiment and very successful She is cured He was ashamed She and the doctor knew his dishonor and then the world His voice was hot angry He followed her to London they were together at the Savoy No He was there Then she told him of her encounter with Martin and how he went away without seeing Julie He had done them a terrible injustice He was piteously grateful held her hands made a foolish attempt to kiss them She grew very pale and said Oh Mr Garrison He dropped them very much embarrassed looked at his watch It was already ten o clock the evening had passed quickly in spite of his misery You are tired I have been inconsiderate Oh no but if you don t mind I ll go to my room now He stood at the foot of the stairs looking after her she smiled back at him She was glad she had been able to bring him a hopeful message They started off the next morning in a comfortable open carriage Mary told him funny stories about the blood poor women and their arsenic intoxication showed him pretty twists in the splendid road built by the Romans They stopped at a little inn for a bite of cheese and a glass of beer He planned a trip to Lugano and over the lake to Italy he was in good spirits the sense of relief acted like a strong stimulant Mary was very loyal to Julie Mr Garrison I can assure you everything is all right I have written to Rome at Mrs Garrison s request After her cure she has plans to go with you to visit Father Cabello Floyd was very penitent I am glad to know that Father Cabello has a strong influence over my wife She has been too worldly I hope he will bring her back to religion On arriving at the hotel Mary went at once to Julie s room it was in great disorder everything scattered about as if she had dressed very hurriedly Floyd downstairs was questioning the woman manager Madame had gone with Monsieur Steele they had taken luncheon with them Did Madame expect Monsieur Garrison No I wanted to surprise her Do you know where they went Yes The boy who drove them is here I would like to find them if possible The woman went to order the wagon Mary was pale agitated Mr Garrison when I left your wife Mr Steele was not here He didn t answer he frightened her What are you going to do Find her and bring her back A storm is brewing said the woman They come up quickly and are terrible while they last The wagon drove up he jumped in Mary stood watching him till he was out of sight The clouds gathered the wind slunk into its den Floyd pushed back his hat wiped the perspiration from his forehead it was stifling The lovers stood together on a grassy plateau the sun poured bright beams of light below was a dense mist How wonderful said Martin Nature has kept a sunny spot for us we ll stay here awhile He drew his lodin cape around him stretched himself out on the grass looking up at the golden clouds surrounding the sun looking below at the rapidly rising veil of gray it was glorious Julie took bread fowl wine out of the basket they ate with their fingers and drank the wine out of the bottle The sun glimmered red through the dark clouds They were silent then he spoke quietly at first becoming gradually very much excited Why did you throw me over so heartlessly after you promised me to prepare your mother I knew it was useless I had made all my arrangements I had a cabin engaged on a French steamer Julie tried to justify herself then began to cry hysterically she had never broken faith with him He couldn t imagine what she d been through all her life The pressure of those two terrible religions her grandfather dragging her one way her mother threatening her with eternal punishment He tried to soothe her Don t cry Julie I ll make it up to you You will be happy for the first time in your life But Floyd he s been so good you always came between us pushing him away She slipped out of his arms It was Floyd now coming between them it wasn t so easy to push him away They had been friends so long Floyd was the innocent victim Martin s eyes roved restlessly and that gray mist rising rising She waited for him to speak then she went to him like a child piteous pathetic Martin don t be angry with me I love you but the winter here is cold the snow is like a winding sheet I couldn t bear it She was wavering again it brought him back fiery impatient We will go to Lugano Italy Spain you will get your divorce I will marry you No No there is no divorce in the Church I am afraid of Father Cabello Those fear thoughts how they tore at her He took her in his arms kissed her until the color came back to her face the warmth to her body She was his absolutely he could make her do what he wanted but he mustn t leave her Then she gave a sudden cry It was like an animal in pain What now What now My boy You won t let them take him away you must promise me that Julie look at me She raised her heavy lids and met his searching glance their souls questioned mutely answered mutely He drew her closer You shall have your boy I promise you Are you satisfied now Yes She was tired beaten to exhaustion by the force of rushing psychic waves breaking against her weak will Her head throbbed she tore off her scarf her hair dropped in a thick coil down her back like a writhing white snake he wound it around his neck This was my punishment No No Our love was not a crime You fought too hard against it Nature put her hand on your head and turned your hair white it was her revenge Julie listened fascinated he was irresistible like that his voice vibrating Every nerve in her body responded He stroked her forehead softly the pain ceased How happy she was how happy You are a woman of the Orient you are starving for love it is your life you cannot fight it it is too strong for you for me come come These children of passion went down into the mist He carried her along in his strong embrace lifting her over the stones her feet scarcely touching the ground there was a wonderful sense of lightness as if she had thrown off a heavy load The fog was cold it dampened her face her hair They reached the bottom of the ravine the clouds around them moved disclosing a little wooden house which had been hidden in the mist Now it stood out clearly a bit of beautiful old architecture Julie shrank away It is a chapel see over the door the cross Take me home take me home He laughed mockingly Nonsense you must get over your religious superstition The chapel will shelter us from the storm Come let us go in No No not there She fled he followed her the mist dropped like a curtain between them growing thicker thicker Julie where are you He heard her voice close to him Here He took her in his arms wrapped his cape about her she clung to him He was deliriously happy he held her in a frenzy of possession Julie my love my love The mist rose slowly the red rays of the setting sun penetrated into the ravine they were enveloped in flames He could see her face now distinctly as she lay in his arms The mist vanished like magic and there there he saw no no it couldn t be Floyd s voice rang out through the pass struck the mountainside and came back Julie Martin held her with a fierce joy He would stand now in the open for what he was Julie was crying pitifully He was very tender He soothed her like a child Hush Hush It is better there will be no more lies Floyd s first impulse was to drag her from Martin s arms but he stood motionless listening to her sobs Then she tore herself away with an appealing cry Floyd Forgive me Forgive me That set both the men on fire Martin gave an angry growl Again Floyd s voice rang out Julie you are my wife You must come with me A moment s silence the trees motionless the clouds sullen waiting then the voice of Nature so long suppressed broke out in Julie No No I belong to Martin I will not leave him I cannot Martin stood a little above her he put out his hand to draw her up she smiled at him God her joy Floyd raised his pistol fired Martin s arm fell to his side Now burning with a murderous rage he sprang forward at closer range This time through the heart With a cry of horror Julie wrested the pistol from his hand It fell some distance away went off reverberating through the valley arousing the people The pastor heard it in the little chapel where he had gone at the approach of the storm He came holding up his lantern seeking the cause A fierce gust of wind blew through the ravine whirling in a dervish like dance of fiendish fury Then the demon in Martin went out to meet the tearing forces of nature Fool Fool You cannot hold her She was never yours never She is mine by Nature s unalterable law Floyd s agonized tones rose above the wind Julie Julie I want to save you from a terrible fate look at him Can t you see He is mad mad That word struck Martin a fatal blow He put his hand to his head there was a look in his eyes like a stricken beast pleading for mercy Floyd never forgot it No No not that He turned and fled stumbling over rocks through bushes a terrible horror pursuing him stretching out its giant claws to entangle him Mad Yes he was mad It was his inheritance The storm raged crashes of thunder flashes of lightning an enormous tree sprang into the air its great quivering limbs cleft in twain The pines wailed muttered waved their long arms he staggered on fighting the elements without within He was conscious of climbing his strength grew fear made him superhuman He heard a voice behind him calling Mad Mad He went on crashing through obstacles going up up there was no measurement of time of distance He stood on the first peak of the great mountain It rose before him a straight wall of stone a deep chasm yawned between He threw out his arms with agonizing longing Up there Up to the top There was no trace of mist The air was cold the sky studded with brilliant planets their light searched his soul He saw clearly the jungle within him the tearing beasts of passion the wreckage the futility the dark future He raised his head to that glory once more then with a cry of despair he went over the precipice The pastor followed Martin to the foot of the mountain He could go no further the ground was slippery dangerous He retraced his steps with a heavy heart He was filled with righteous anger One of his name had dishonored a woman he must make restitution He found Julie in a frenzy of fear calling again and again Martin Martin She stood like a white spirit erect in the storm The lightning rent the clouds then the floods came down They carried her to the shelter of the chapel The little building centuries old was originally a storehouse for contraband a refuge for bandits who hid themselves from the gendarmes among the wine barrels in the caves beneath When the Church took it they brought a beautiful altar from Italy and artists who painted religious figures on the walls The wine caves were partitioned into cells where pious monks prayed and rubbed their rheumatic limbs Finally this holy place a victim of skeptical times was used as a theatre where allegorical plays dealing with the political and religious history of the country were performed When Julie became conscious of the dimly lit altar with its faded velvet and gold lace its figure of the Virgin in painted wood she stood transfixed she saw herself on the day of her confirmation her mother putting around her neck a gold chain and cross she heard her own voice repeating the Confession of Faith the organ pealing the Hymn of Praise the lights the Presence With a cry of anguish she fell on her knees Holy Mary Mother of God have pity Then a deep tender voice filled the chapel the voice of Father Cabello Father Cabello was a mystic Brought up within the walls of a monastery dedicated to Heaven from his birth he saw the will of God in every event of his kaleidoscopic existence He had travelled much studied much with the one ever dominating ambition which slowly but inevitably came to its fulfillment The Gonzola family with money and influence had in those two generations been a great Catholic influence in America Father Cabello was the power behind it He had sustained Mrs Gonzola that devout pious woman in her awful struggles with Joseph Abravanel He loved Julie held himself responsible for her soul He would save her as he had saved her mother He had been ill in Rome stricken down with fever caught in the unsanitary quarters trying to improve the deplorable condition of the people he went down under a hopeless task Many a night seated at his luxurious table with its rich appointments its costly wines a terrible thought would come again and again Was the poverty of its children a curse laid upon the Holy City for the generations of intolerance its auto da f its crusades He tried to drive those haunting spirits away he was not the Judge only an insignificant part of an indestructible Institution a symbol the moulded image of an Iron Will Delirium consumed him He was for weeks near death then came very slowly back to life Lying on his flowered terrace the great panorama of Rome before him he thought of Julie She had written to him often after he left America but her letters grew less frequent Before his sickness he had received a short note from Mary telling of Julie s second collapse and her trip to Switzerland the arsenic waters at the Val Sinestra had helped her wonderfully the cure would end July twenty second There was apparently nothing to cause uneasiness in the letter Father Cabello was ostensibly of Jesuit origin but he possessed a much older secret inheritance from the time when his ancestors were noble Spanish Maranos deeply versed in deception and the Talmud He scented the trail of disaster Why had not Julie written to him herself Why had she travelled to Europe without her husband her child Why Why The doctors advised him to go on a visit to America where the climate would drive the malaria out of his system He refused his strength was not equal to so long a journey Then they advised Disentis in Switzerland one of the few strong holds left to the Church He was haunted with the thought of Julie He would go to the Val Sinestra and see for himself Disentis its crumbling piles of stone monasteries of the seventh century its stillness its health giving air the wonderful healing waters gushing from the earth into natural rock basins hollowed out by Nature s hand the frugal fare the rising at the first glimpse of dawn the pervading sweetness of the bells prayer which had a new sanctity as if nearer the Divine Fount there he gained new spiritual inspiration new physical strength there during the summer months the Benedictine Friars welcome their brothers from all corners of the world Father Cabello clasped hands with monks of many orders The Trappists appealed strongly to his affection bare footed humble rich in knowledge he never tired listening to their many colored experiences He was eagerly questioned about America the land of unbounded possibilities He had a store of humorous stories which were greeted with low chuckles and spasmodic movements of the diaphragm Walking with the Father Superior one day in the surrounding woods that benign forest which protects the children of God from the avalanche Father Cabello asked about Val Sinestra and how he could get there Easily from here my carriage is at your disposal a drive at leisure through the mountains a most beautiful and interesting trip Near the Val Sinestra there is an ancient bit of architecture a deserted chapel it is now the property of a poor community headed by a great man Pastor Staehli the Church should buy it back I will see to it said Father Cabello The next day he started out there was no trace of anger in the blue sky but the driver pointed to a small watery cloud low on the horizon We are going to have a storm would it not be better to wait until it is over said the Superior Father Cabello hesitated then he answered I want to be at Val Sinestra before the twenty second I am being pushed by a strong impulse which has some mysterious significance a call for help from one I love Then go in God s name That drive through the mountains was a sacrament Father Cabello bowed before a great God clothed in a sacerdotal vestment of Nature There is the chapel said the driver It was distinctly visible in the valley below Suddenly a shot rang out What was that The driver shook his head It seemed to the excited imagination of the priest like a discharge signalling a great battle then the fury of the Invisible broke the man whipped up his horses and dashed down the incline toward the chapel It is wonderful in the mountains after such an outbreak of electric force the Prince of Light marches majestically in the Heavens showering gifts of prismatic gold a Master Chemist he will create again from the storm wreckage the stricken trees will sink into the bosom of the earth and moulder there generating in Nature s crucible new germs of Life and the little dark pine children will be born Floyd paced restlessly outside the chapel listening to Julie s sobs and the voice of the priest tender persuasive stern threatening Once before he had pleaded with Joseph Abravanel now a second time he is pleading with his wife His wife No No Lies Lies She was never his she belonged to Martin by the unalterable law of Nature They would go on saying that He would always see them with their arms around each other He had been cheated cheated A sharp bolt of light pierced the dark valley shone on the battered cross above the chapel glanced off lit up the silver trimmings of the pistol on the ground He picked it up The voices in the chapel rose and fell You must go back to your husband I will not I belong to Martin I will never leave him I cannot Her voice was sharp with agony Floyd shuddered why should she be tortured like that Why If he were dead they could live He was dead burnt to cinders The tongues of flame in his father s workshop had crept into his body consumed it there was nothing left but the shell easy enough to put an end to that clay image Shoot its head off The pastor wrested the pistol from the hand of the distraught man led him through a trail to the ch let and left him with Angela He was quiet now he lay back in a chair with closed eyes She sat and watched him passing her cool hand over his hot forehead the lamp shed a soft glow over the pale face the well shaped head the regular features A splendid human species those Americans a youthful race a type ennobled by climate good food and labor that develops character She thought of the cretins of her own beautiful land of the degenerating races of Europe This man was like Dresden china fine very fine but there were deep lines that made the face look old the chisel of Life had cut deeply into him She bent over him Come with me He looked blankly into her soft radiant eyes Who was she She took him up the narrow stairs into a small room with bare white walls a little cot a bunch of Alpine roses on a table by the window Will you try to sleep No No She led him to the balcony a nest under the overhanging roof Sit here you will sleep She put him in a reclining chair and left him The moon shone on his flushed face the valley was filled with soft shadows the mountain raised a luminous head The air penetrated his agonized body An hour passed a white figure stood beside him Come in The night air in the mountains is too strong for strangers He saw her through a mist his eyes dim with overpowering sleep He fell on the cot she covered him with a warm blanket The pastor called the guides together they came with their ropes and axes He spoke tersely they were used to action not words A man had gone up the mountain in the storm Then he gave a low whistle There was a panting a breaking through the bushes A dog threw himself upon the pastor who bent over him stroking his thick coat with a magnetic touch He gave him Martin s mantle the dog tore at it dropped it The pastor whispered Find him With a low whine the animal plunged into the thicket the guides followed their strong throats propelling sounds that echoed to the unscaled heights The hotel was in an uproar The pale women excited by the storm could not be kept in their rooms they crowded the corridors uttering plaintive cries The quick flashes of lightning revealed little groups huddled together one poor thing quite lost her control She betrayed her terror in a strangely interesting manner rushed to the long door opening onto the balcony baring her white bosom to the storm She was wonderful as she stood there her face rapturous like a woman lifting herself to the embrace of her lover The storm passed The pale women fluttered in the sun holding up their bloodless hands to its warmth chattering laughing over their thrilling experience Mary was terribly worried about her friends The carriage had not come back The proprietress thought the party had been driven through the short cut to the pastor s ch let But the shot said Mary The woman looked grave It was not hunting time When the carriage drove up with Julie and Father Cabello Mary knew something terrible had happened She grew very pale but she had been trained to ask no questions Julie was quiet with wide open horror filled eyes Father Cabello took Mary s hand and spoke gravely There has been an accident Mr Steele has been lost in the storm they are looking for him She caught her breath Mr Garrison The priest pierced her with his understanding eyes Mr Garrison is safe he and his wife will leave here by the early train tomorrow Will you see to everything Yes said Mary Then his voice hardened No matter what happens they must go nothing can prevent that Julie let herself be undressed and fell into a lethargy Mary tried several times to awaken her she would open her eyes and fall again into that trance which was not sleep The pastor came over to the hotel to see Father Cabello They talked long into the night of Floyd Julie of the fight against Martin The pastor repeated again He is one of ours he has done wrong He must make restitution Father Cabello was troubled Julie had shown unexpected strength He must find a way to bring her back to the Church to submission The next morning early Mary was surprised to find Julie up and dressed The hotel was closing that day The trunks had to be locked and taken down Julie watched her moving about If I could get out of this room it is horrible A hotel room before the departure of its occupant with its torn newspapers remnants of food bedclothes thrown in a heap there is nothing more desolate more inexpressibly forlorn They went down to an empty room on the ground floor misnamed the children s playroom The pale women were unmarried or childless Julie moved continually from one window to another when she saw Father Cabello and Floyd coming up the walk she shrank into a corner a terrified hunted thing Father Cabello found Floyd very quiet whatever may have been his feelings he had them under perfect control He answered the priest s questions in as few words as possible and listened without comment to his sophistical justification of Julie Perhaps your wife was not all to blame Perhaps not You know Julie s nature she is easily influenced Yes I know The man must have persecuted her Perhaps he did I don t wish to blame you but knowing what has happened and the desperate character of the man was it right to let your wife travel alone Perhaps it was not right But it didn t occur to me When they entered the room Floyd stood quietly at the door The priest went to Julie and took her hand Julie you must ask your husband to forgive you The answer came again I will not I belong to Martin I will never leave him The priest s wrath was terrible He stormed threatened pleaded she must go with her husband there must be no scandal She must go home to her child Floyd was white to the lips Mary couldn t bear it She rushed out of the room The pastor came up the terrace Father Cabello went out to meet him and brought him in He spoke quietly with deep feeling The guides who were seeking Martin Steele have come down from the mountain Have they found him Yes He is dead There was a silence It was Floyd this time who cried with a rush of repentant agony Martin I killed him I am a murderer No he himself was responsible He met the fate of the rash A man must know the precipices and how to avoid them before he tries to climb Again came the cry from Floyd I shot to kill I shot to kill The guides followed his traces up the mountain there were signs that told a human thing had passed He must have gone over at the first plateau They went down as far as they dared There were broken branches the violence of the fall tore up a young tree with its roots Come with me I will show you where he struck the trail There was madness upon him his senses wandered the inevitable happened They stood in the quiet woods and looked up at the wall of stone where Martin had said I will climb that mountain The pastor put his arm around Floyd My son you have been through more than your share of trouble don t burden yourself with morbid self accusations He was your friend he betrayed you He made the only reparation death Try to think kindly of him Under natural conditions he would have been a brave son of the soil He was robbed of his birthright Julie shed no tears The old fear was upon her the Punishment had come again in the shape of Death and he had paid The priest worked upon this superstitious dread it was the only way to subdue her God had punished her for her crime against her husband He would punish her further she must go home she must go back to her religion God had struck Martin with the whip of retribution He would bring it down upon her shoulders if she did not repent A great calamity would happen to her child She was cowed humble on her knees before him begging for mercy He confessed her and gave her absolution Mr and Mrs Garrison left by the afternoon train they were a pitiable sight these two unhappy children wondering why the world was so dark the pain so hard to bear The priest spoke the last words My children you are going home You will be happy again if you do not nourish your misfortune God has given us the magic of memory and a still greater blessing the gift of forgetting They bowed their heads to his blessing The train left the station wending its way in and out of the tunnels When I watch those undulations said the pastor to Father Cabello I think of a serpent crawling into the great centers of vice carrying with him the modern Adams the curious Eves who will eat copiously of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge The priest smiled The simile appealed to his mind trained in Biblical metaphors I have no fears for our young couple the New World moulds its people The practical life of which they are an integral part will make their road clear to them I have lived long in America It is a land of proof not belief of practical results and a kind of idealism which is expressed in action There is no time for dreams inspiration feeds only on quick realization A land of no secrets where publicity methods are applied alike to business science literature religion That which cannot be exploited is called high brow but there is a saving humor in it all America is a great country The pastor answered with just a touch of good natured satire If there are no secrets how is it that the Church has prospered there The priest smiled enigmatically The Church adapts itself I am going back to Rome with a mind at rest We have held together the thread of two lives which threatened to snap nay three lives there is a boy whose career must be watched closely Other forces are at work race impulses they must be eradicated Is that possible Yes but difficult I shall bring the boy to Rome there all other influences will be neutralized The pastor offered his hospitality for the night which was gratefully accepted It had been a turbulent time ending happily The priest was in a frame of mind harmonizing with the beauty of approaching twilight They sat outside the ch let The pastor filled long glasses with the wine of the Canton which expands the Soul They sat there looking into the Val Sinestra until the sun scattered rubies and the moon threw down a silver veil They talked of the future of religion and the wave of unbelief sweeping over the world When I meet a man like you said the priest I regret the loss to the Church Protestantism was at best a frail child it cannot survive without support Why should it not come back We would kill the fatted calf to celebrate the return of our Prodigal Son The pastor saved the situation with a fine sense of humor My friend we are not father and son we are brothers prodigal children of the great original God of the Hebrews The priest s eyes gleamed Then why not a family reunion It has been my life s dream all sects united in the spacious bosom of the true Faith The pastor nodded in silent approval Then Luther would come into his own At this same moment far away in the East the muezzin was chanting from the minarets calling the people to prayer There is but one God and Mohammed is his Prophet and at this same time millions of humans prostrate before Buddha were praying to attain the perfection of the Soul Nirvana and the chosen people once again in Jerusalem were praising the only God who had led them out of exile into the land of their fathers The priest and the pastor would soon solve their problem they were both approaching with silent rapid steps the solution of the Great Mystery The next morning Father Cabello thanked the pastor again for his good offices He was a practical man and in the light of day dreams evaporate He did not speak of buying the chapel he wanted to go in peace Angela sat at the wheel her quick skilful fingers spinning the yellow thread The girl with her unerring instinct of the unseen felt the air weighing heavily The atmosphere of the house was charged with sadness unhappy spirits had passed through leaving something of their sorrow their passions The anguish of Floyd still lingering in her little room kept her awake at night The dead man was always before her his uneven gait the passionate face the glittering eyes A great longing went out from her to that rebellious soul beating so long against bars a prisoner in his own body The pastor had gone over to the hotel for Martin s one valise and the little deerskin box He spoke to the woman of the house she remembered her father telling of a Staehli who went across seas and never came back The crooked gardener shuffling about chimed in Yes I knew Martin Staehli He had a quarrel with a guide about a woman and shot him dead He was hot blooded The man lost on the mountain was his grandson said the pastor Strange things happen in a lifetime mumbled the gardener Now who would believe to look at me that I was once the champion wrestler of the village The next morning at sunrise the pastor knocked at Angela s door Angela we are going up there today During the summer when they were pasturing the cattle she and the pastor spent many a happy time with the peasant boys and girls who had gone up in June clinging gradually from one plateau to another until they reached the top where they would stay until the weather drove them down Angela sprang joyfully out of bed and went to fetch her basket on the way up she would look for herbs It was wonderful how she spied the rare plants hid away under the rocks and at the bottom of brooks They went slowly at first Angela timing her steps to the pastor s who grasped his stick gaining strength as he climbed Not far behind a guide followed carrying the belongings of the unfortunate man In Switzerland every waterfall river flower bush and tree has its legendary Spirit Miracle stories come down by word of mouth The old grandmother sitting outside the ch let at night a pipe between her toothless gums her needle running a race with her tongue tells the children of the wonders of the mountains In the old days when a mountaineer had been lost on the heights the peasants would go from peak to peak calling his name Where the echo repeated they stopped and would throw down articles of clothing and a large cheese from the milk of the missing man s herd to keep his spirit from cold and starvation They tell of a peasant who was lost They let down his dog on a rope The faithful animal whining in low dog tones eagerly scented the way When they drew up the rope it was bitten through The dog had found the body of his master and would not leave him Whenever there is a thick mist the peasant is seen his dog beside him on the edge of the chasm pointing with a warning finger to the precipice The merry band of dairy workers welcomed the pastor with shrill cries and clarion notes from Alpine horns It was a modest community each one owned his little herd There were many huts where the milk is set in earthen bowls yielding cream butter cheese their only wealth The pastor drew a herdsman aside and spoke to him in low tones A stillness fell on the merry band The man led them across the field to a deep pool fed by mountain torrents at a narrow end was a rough rustic bridge which they crossed in single file and came into a thick pine grove Farther on the clearing was carpeted with roses anemones violets They walked carefully not to crush them then they climbed up a steep rock to a cow hut on the top Angela gave a low cry A man lay on a bed of hay his arm in a rough splinter his face the wax of death She dropped down beside him listened to his heart tried to raise his closed lids He is dead I think not answered the peasant I have seen many such cases of suspended animation from the shock of a heavy fall Then he told them how Martin had been saved from going to the bottom of the precipice by being caught in a crevice of the rocks He was found tightly wedged in covered by the stones that had rolled down The dog had scented the place where he lay It would be a miracle if he lived The pastor patted the head of the animal who would now and again put his paw very gently on the man s chest as if seeking for heart beats Then he d lick the white face wag his tail and stretch himself out again I won t give up hope said the pastor until the dog howls and slinks away Angela was moving about She made a wood fire on the rock outside filled a large iron pot with water and stirred in her herbs with which she would bathe his bruised body They emitted a pungent agreeable perfume The pastor watched her as she stood a bright figure against the dark pine background a blessed child Angela passed the night in a hut with the dairy maids She was intensely awake concentrating her entire spiritual power She ceased to be a human thing she became a Thought a disembodied Will She arose from the bed where the peasant girls were sleeping three together their arms entwined their hair sweeping the ground their white arms and bosoms like ivory in the night light a great picture of future mothers bearing in their bodies the next generation She stepped out into the air listened to the walking of the waters the talking of the trees she heard panting Something warm pressed against her The dog jumped on her whining What was the message Was it death She followed the excited animal over the stones over the pool into the hut The man was lying as she had left him but there was something in his face that made her heart leap She took the limp form in her arms The breath of her young body the life that was in the sap of the trees the minerals of the springs the healing balsam of the air all the natural force in her and more the dynamic power of the spirit went out to him Her hands tingling with electricity moved tensely over his chest his limbs the dog watched helping with his mute soul Suddenly the curtains over the heavy eyes quivered opened then dropped again her fingers on his pulse felt slow intermittent throbs She had dragged him from the depths he hovered for weeks between Life and the Beyond coming back slowly but the mind remained inert The summer was unusually mild they put him outside on a soft bed of boughs where he lay day and night in silence with the dog beside him his eyes following Angela as she moved about She taught him to walk again guiding his steps carefully The pastor came weekly to see him spoke to him but he didn t answer Angela grew anxious Does he think I believe not said the pastor It is a kind of aphasia which time will cure Angela wondered if he could distinguish sounds the chirping of the birds the bark of the dog the music of the herd The peasants would tell in lowered voices of a shadow of a man standing under the pines so still the chamois would come closer closer looking at him with their soft beseeching eyes then they d scamper away August It was bleak The man sat on the trunk of a tree he was without the thrill of life The pastor spoke to him Do you want anything No Do you know me A flash passed over the face Yes The pastor s voice grew stern You will go down tomorrow with the herdsmen You are the peasant Staehli they are your people you are one of them You have been all your life in exile now you are on your natural soil The voice of race will awaken in you you will find yourself The man listened agonized with the intensity of concentration the words cut like sharp stones into him You understand you are the peasant Staehli The answer came back mechanically I am the peasant Staehli The next day Staehli the peasant went down with the herds from plateau to plateau lingering while the weather favored Late in the summer they reached the valley Winter in that little hidden away corner of the world snow without beginning without end scarcity of food dread of the avalanche The peasant is a fatalist accepting the inevitable with silence with awe God is good He sends summer as a rich reward The pastor shared the hard lot of his parish The Devil was always there in the shape of schnaaps driving the simple souls to madness making cretins of their children The pastor fought the Evil One with holy ire like his great ancestor Martin Luther Every night he would take his lantern and tramp over to the Inn sit with his children drink with them moderately see the liquor locked up put the key in his pocket and go his way Many a morning he found the cupboard tampered with pretending not to see the lock had been repaired Now Martin went with him sitting silent answering laconically The pastor gave him much physical labor washed out roads to remake wood to cut and draw There was a landslide a part of the village was under snow Martin worked with pick and shovel to dig out the people carrying the women and children in his arms his strength growing as the hardiest collapsed When it was too cold for the old man Martin went alone to the Inn to lock up One night walking home the sky like velvet studded with clustered diamonds the mysterious blue light on the snow the silence the penetrating beauty threw a spell over him He wandered till the unseen sun shot up faint rays turning the white world into faded rose then memory stirred in him Angela saw him tracing with a piece of charcoal on a board She put slips of paper and pencil in his way he scribbled on them threw them down forgot them They were confused lines crossing recrossing impressionist shapes of mountains and always the faint outlines of a woman s head She put them carefully in a box he would remember some day She saw quick flashes in his eyes sparks blazing up dying out He sat outside the ch let hammering nails into the soles of the mountain boots he had made for himself The Staehlis had always learnt a trade they were shoemakers tanners blacksmiths herders sons of toil and of the soil The pastor stood watching him The snow has melted in the valley the sky is clear We will wander forth to the south first and back on foot when the trees blossom They started off in the early morning An old peasant leaning somewhat heavily on his solid staff of hickory wood a young peasant silent unsmiling Angela put paper and crayon in his knapsack Bring me pictures they tell more than words They tramped through valleys over hills jumping on hay wagons climbing into stage coaches riding the sure footed mountain pony The pastor watched Martin There were blood streaks in his eyes his face was like a wax mask They came to lovely Lugano the Fatima in Switzerland s harem of beauties warm passionate the soft Italian patois Italian air Italian skies Over there across the lake is Milan Rome the Raphael frescoes Martin s eyes gleamed then he shook his head The pastor sighed would he ever wake up Geneva intellectual proud of its men of genius They walked through Rousseau s Island of Exile He was greatly gifted said the pastor but the victim of his own sensuality We are all that said Martin Then the veil of melancholy dropped again When we are conscious of it the cure is there Rousseau was the mind of his generation he might have been its soul but he never found himself Einsiedeln with its monasteries a thousand years old its few sad Benedictine hermits poring over their ancient manuscripts restoring the eaten away remnants kept with pious reverence hidden in old chests Einsiedeln its pilgrims its Life Eternal hypnotized under the spell of religion Arosa the bleak mountains the hopeless sick wrapped in blankets on open balconies Martin shivered Let us go Zurich again with its historical surroundings The pastor told the story of Charlemagne who finding a toad sitting in the nest of a beautiful serpent drove it out and killed it with one blow of his heavy stick There was a banquet at the Palace that night the guards were terrified at the sight of a white spotted snake who crawled into the hall wound herself up on the legs of a chair and dropped a priceless jewel into the goblet of wine which the monarch held to his lips giving him the magic gift of compelling the love of all who set eyes on him A toad in her nest repeated Martin Two months in the cities then the country beautiful the trees heavy with white blossoms bearing embryonic fruit Toward evening the air grew heavy with the day s perfume the night was warm in the valley Martin moved about restlessly I cannot sleep let us go into the woods They walked through dark trails lit faintly by stars shining through the trees then he broke a long silence speaking of himself for the first time slowly timidly The air goes through me it is sweeping away that terrible fear If I could be free of the horror that tears at me the horror of madness The pastor spoke eagerly Fight it Martin drive it out It is an illusion an evil thought that does not exist Martin your soul is in prison beating its wings against the bars of your own obstinacy let it soar I cannot I am choked with wild impulses driving me to distraction I am mad I tell you mad Martin there is a madness which destroys and a madness that reveals such madness has been the salvation of the world Come sit down with me here in this forest where once lived and suffered our great ancestor our patron Saint Mad Martin Mad Martin Then he told in picturesque English lapsing unconsciously into his own musical Romansch the legend of Mad Martin He was one of a lawless band the youngest bandit of them all a beautiful youth with the grace of a wild stag without fear or sense of right prowling about with his carbine robbing killing consorting with lewd women One night a night like this in the woods where holiness dwelt something stirred within him a voice clear beautiful said wonderful things which gave his soul wings Yes that happens sometimes a voice from within said Martin He left the band made his way to the church and begged to be taken in He was rarely gifted the monks saw in him the white fervor of the saint The Lord had changed the murderous rage of the robber into the divine madness of the fanatic He went to Einsiedeln and there it was said heard the voice of God who commanded him to become a monk As the story goes the Lord to try his piety put in his way a last temptation He was walking in the woods reading his prayers when he suddenly came upon a beautiful vicious thing who had loved him in his bandit days she put her arms around him her mouth to his He forgot Heaven He tried to tear himself away Her kisses held him She lured him to her cabin and in the intoxication of passion he took no count of time Her kisses held him repeated Martin She made a plan that would bind him to her forever she plied him with wine until his senses fled stripped him naked crowned him with a wreath of red poppies left him dancing and singing ribald songs a young Bacchus in the woods then she called the priests to witness his degradation They believed her not the young Divine was deep in the under cells fasting praying purifying his body preparing for his ordination She mocked at them Fools He is no priest he is Mad Martin He cannot change his blood still riots in him calling for wine for women If I lie burn me at the stake Mad Martin in the woods heard the angry voices of the people the mocking gibes of the woman and realized his degradation He fled to the cabin locked himself in fell on his knees and prayed for help The chanting of priests the cries of the people grew louder their axes were breaking down the door The poor sinner raised his arms to Heaven with a cry in which his battered stricken soul took joyful flight When the enraged people burst into the cabin they found it empty They searched the cells of the monastery there was no trace of him The Father Superior a holy man of years was calm Wait he will not fail us The day of consecration came among the young priests stood a tall figure in white ready to take his vows He was pale and faint from fasting but his voice was like a bell sounding from the distance As he left the altar there was a bright light on his face The people followed him on their knees He put out his hands blessed them and the cripples threw away their crutches and the sick were well Then he blessed Einsiedeln and made it a holy place for pilgrims in the ages to come He blessed the village under the mountain where he was born sinned and atoned and prophesied its future peace prosperity Then he disappeared before their eyes but he has been kept alive in our hearts and memory Every three years the people of our village give in the little chapel The Miracle of Saint Martin There was a long silence Martin sat his face buried in his hands The pastor spoke again Martin Free yourself of this horror let Hope in Life is knocking at your door with gifts of fulfillment Martin struggled with the torrent of feeling rushing through him then the dry eyes grew moist the tears came The fever of hate the passion of Love the terrible impulse of self destruction a devil tempting in the night the thought of life with reason gone all the dangers of an overwrought mind were washed away in those tears He dropped down broken helpless on the new sweet hay in a little hut near by the cool air swept over him A bird s plaintive call startled the silence an unforgettable night of spiritual revelation Peace It was dawn when he awoke He looked about for the Pastor found him lying in a corner his mantle wrapped about him Martin looked long at the noble snow crowned head then stole softly out came upon a clear pool hidden in the trees we meet them unexpectedly in Switzerland startling us with their limpid loveliness There was a flash of Glory the Sun He felt a sense of elation of new birth The sky turned purple pink gold the color ecstasy crept into his blood Color the life of the world Color clamored in his brain for expression for air he was obsessed with the madness that reveals the divine madness of the artist The pastor stood beside him The sun was climbing Martin pointed to a ball of fire down deep in the lake I m going to bring it up he said He slipped off his clothes and dived in floating twisting himself like a dolphin spouting water in the air then he ran along the green borders his body gleaming in the sun The pastor thought of the legend of the Water Gods They went slowly on foot toward home stopping at the little Dorfs where the peasants greeted them with acclamations A fine lad a Staehli every inch of him Martin returned their gripping handshakes tossed down their schnaaps gave them points on the disinfection of barns and the care of cows danced with the maids on the green kissed them they pelted him with flowers At the door of the ch let Angela stood waiting He put a portfolio in her hands bits of color he had caught on the way Her eyes were fixed on his face This was not the Martin she had known it was like the same face reflected in clear water etherealized by the refraction of light She heard him in the fields his strong voice filling the distance with melody She looked up at the great mountain An unfortunate man called Martin Steele lay there dead The Garrisons came back to their home on Park Avenue With Mary s help and his own will Floyd learnt to diagnose Julie s actions as psychic impulses She herself couldn t do wrong she fought against a subconscious tendency From her girlhood it had always been like that this was the bridge over which he could pass to reconciliation He had every reason to be satisfied with his wife She was in correspondence with Father Cabello whose influence revealed itself in her piety She became very devout Heavenly love drove out the earthly in her She attended daily mass the big eyed woman with her beautiful boy were well known at the Cathedral Floyd noticed after coming home from service a rapt expression on her face she went about with upturned eyes like St Cecilia He had a vision of a black robed nun He spoke to Dr McClaren I am afraid my wife is developing a religious complex I think not answered the doctor I imagine before it gets so far that insatiable emotional craving of hers will find a new stimulus There was something wrong with Floyd His intense desire to forget the unpleasant episode in Switzerland had overstrained his nerves They reacted in a strange manner He d leave his home in the morning with the intention of going to see the Colonel and would find himself wandering aimlessly in quite a different direction He d walk for hours through parts of the city unknown to him he saw strange faces strange places another world He lounged about where the ships came in The immigrants had an irresistible fascination He watched them listened to their unintelligible jargon A dark eyed Madonna with a shawl on her head a child at her breast was not strange to him He knew her she was Julie s sister A bearded old man carrying on his bent shoulders the tragedy of his race looked at him with the eyes of Joseph Abravanel A straight tall peasant with bundles bewildered by the city was Martin s grandfather It was a kind of mental phantasmagoria of those who had worked a sinister influence in his life He couldn t get rid of them he saw their Past their Present their Future the struggles the agony the hopelessness He was flung backward forward with them Must he go on living with them all his life A horror seized him Taxi sir take you anywhere A tall chauffeur with dark goggles took him by the arm and lifted him into the cab Where to sir Floyd bent forward he knew that voice Tom Dillon Mr Garrison You won t say anything Floyd grasped his hand with quick sympathy and drew him into the car Tom choked at first but gradually recovering himself told his story I married Maudy because I couldn t get her any other way Oh she was a kisser She d go as far as the fence but she wouldn t jump it We were coming home from a dance up the road I tried it on Tom she said if you want me you ll have to marry me I married her I didn t take it seriously I thought this way It s as broad as it s long When I get enough there s Reno She flung the dough like Hell I couldn t see any value for it only a heap of rags Anyhow a man can get liquor and women Yes I know Tom shifted uneasily in his seat When you don t earn money melts My credit kept me going for a time Then I had to tell her I was sure she d leave me I m only good to hand out She told me that lots of times She left you Tom s eyes snapped he was radiant with pride She didn t She had an auction sale All her friends were there they wouldn t miss it She sold everything even her engagement ring and paid every cent I owed By God she did There was a choked sob I had to do something to get even didn t I Yes Tom Floyd was beginning to respect him I went to my friends but they wanted solid men in their business and I couldn t blame em I walked about like a crazy man couldn t get a job She kept enough to furnish a band box in the Bronx She does all the work You must see her She s as pretty as a peach and the place is as neat as wax But how did you come to this Tom She sent me to sell the car that hurt me I went and sat around the garage with the boys I was down and out they had money to burn They said Sell nothing doing a car like yours is capital Well I didn t sell I commenced going out nights I was ashamed to be seen but I got over that Then I risked it in the daytime now I flaunt my shame I tell you it s a rotten world when I had money it was a stunt to do my own repairs When I took the crowd out joy riding I was a good sport but to hack for a living is common I m done with that swell bunch Maudy says they re beneath us Then he sat looking at Floyd his eyes begging Tom you ve solved your problem I m proud of you Tom heaved a sigh of relief and got back to business Now I suppose you want to get home I don t know said Floyd wearily Tom gave him a sharp look What are you doing down here anyhow seeing some capitalist off No watching poor wretches come in I ve been through a lot and I haven t quite got my bearings Tom asked no questions but he told Maudy afterwards he was sure Garrison had some trouble with that crazy wife of his You d better come outside with me and get some fresh air you don t mind me taking a fare if it comes my way I ve got another car there s a guy in with me I dope it out this way he gets twenty five per cent of the takings I get the rest and pay for the damn gas The car s on instalment when we pay it off we ll go it equal Fair enough isn t it Yes it is Tom had coarsened the veneer of wealth was gone Floyd liked him that way You ve grown stouter Tom you re the picture of health Tom slapping his chest complacently came in collision with an enormous truck He let out a stream of oaths which paralyzed the physically inferior opponent The poor devil cranked frantically and got out of his way It was your fault Tom not his Of course it was but that alien wouldn t dare open his mouth to a free born American If he tried it on they d wipe him out Tom spoke with a rich Irish inherited brogue which all his college education hadn t eradicated We were talking about me weren t we Yes I ve gained thirty pounds I eat like a hog and I m for Prohibition every time At first I worried myself to bones about Maudy I was afraid to tell her I was hacking Her family s a hundred per cent American and she s damn proud When I brought home money she wouldn t take it You re on the crook Tom and I m going to leave you Then I blurted it all out I was frightened stiff what do you think she did Haven t any idea Tom abused you roundly for a piker Na she just hugged me till I didn t have a breath left Tom she said I ve cried many a long night I couldn t see you making a living God is good He wouldn t let me go begging to my rich friends Hacking s a fine business but there s something against it those flappers Don t take em in your car sooner lose a fare You re good looking and they ll get you Floyd laughed Tom was the right medicine for him They were driving uptown Tom s tongue went faster than the car he had acquired a lot of practical information They re starring the crime wave now all bunk we re no worse than we were Wait till after the election the prisons will be so empty they ll have to turn em into meeting houses What do you think of them stinking Republicans up in Washington Tom don t insult my inherited political party I ve had them handed down to me and I must carry them Tom opened his mouth the brimstone flowed the air was blue then suddenly he was dazzled by two shapely legs encased in flesh colored cobwebs and a pair of bright eyes emitting sparks Taxi Miss He drew up to the curbstone smiling at her showing his white teeth sprang out opened the door dusted off the seat held the rug in his hand She was undecided I don t want to go yet Yes you do but you don t know it laughed Tom A gust of cold wind blew her against him Tom glanced downward Your legs are cold Oh Warm as toast Your blood keeps them warm She twisted her little mouth No my vanity Clever girl Tom lifted her bodily into the car they were old friends now He wrapped her in the warm rug and put a match to her cigarette Who s the melancholy Dane in front Oh He s a guy I m breaking in They drove to Madison Avenue She jumped out and gave him a generous fare I want to go out again tonight call for me He smiled into the pretty laughing eyes Awful sorry Miss but there s nothing doing I m married He heaved a big sigh She was nice wasn t she Floyd slapped him on the back You re a hero Tom It was a great temptation Tom beamed They ve taken it into their pretty heads to star the chauffeur We re the cowboys of the East We drive and slash about and lasso them in Say I m afraid I m going to lose my man handsome lad good family There s a little snipe baiting for him and she ll hook him too At the garage he found a note Married this morning to Ida family approve Tom s sorrow was pathetic They re rich brokers They ll put him on the street He ll never be able to earn an honest penny again Where shall I find another like him The girls fell for him every time He was a handsome fish You ve got nothing to do help me out just for today You can run a car It doesn t need so much experience and I can t afford to let her stand idle I haven t got the experience Tom but I can hand you the good looks said Floyd modestly Tom was jubilant he d have to keep his mind on the wheel and a few knocks would shake him up Now I ll give you the fruits of my experience Before you turn a corner blow the horn then stop and listen Don t try to pass anything let the other fellow smash you up then you ll get damages The wise guy says we ve got a third eye in the back of our heads Exercise yours it ll work after a while When an old woman or a cat gets in front don t run her down jump off and put her on the sidewalk Train your ears to hear the pistol in a man s pocket Keep your foot on the brake and a curb on your temper a timely joke can make it a dollar more You ll get into tough places so does a doctor Your fare is your patient save his life if you can When it comes to a toss up you know who gets the preference Never argue with a crook take whatever he gives If it s nothing say thank you and get away Don t let pretty feet lead you astray A man s strength depends on his disposition and the time of night If you fall for it forget it Do what you can t help but whatever you do don t get found out It s all contradiction you do something now and you don t do it the next time If the same thing happens twice it s never the same thing You ve got to be not only a good chauffeur but a good actor a good talker a good curser a good fighter a good navigator a good all around regular feller and then you don t half fill the bill Now scoot Yes sir said Floyd and plunged into the depths of the night city His first venture in the taxi business was a personal success Taxi sir taxi Miss take you anywhere where to Miss The women jumped in at once he picked up two going to the theatre Would he call for them at eleven thirty With great pleasure answered Floyd He helped them out and stood with his hat in his hand He forgot he was a chauffeur for a moment Then he drove people uptown downtown all over town guiding his car in and out of the great mass of congested traffic A young fellow rushed at him Drive for your life my wife is dying It was up in the Bronx Floyd put on the speed He got away from two policemen and landed at a brick house with the blinds lowered The man dashed up the steps Is she alive Thank God He threw Floyd a bill You did well my man keep the change Floyd felt like a public benefactor Hacking was a noble profession He was hailed by two men who jumped in He didn t like them He heard the pistol looked into the butt of it They gave him a street number outside the city limits Drive like Hell He did The men jumped out into a vacant lot Now cut away and don t squeal Floyd said Thank you and shot across the town He was held up and questioned No he hadn t seen anybody He had no compunctions He wouldn t give the guys away that wasn t sport Then he took the car back to the garage and went home in the subway He had thirty dollars He put fifteen in an envelope addressed it to Tom and wrote on a slip of paper Dear Tom Here is half the boodle It was a great experience Ready to help out at any time Tom got back early to the garage washed his khaki suit hung it up to dry cleaned his car looked over the motor He waited for Floyd but he didn t show up he was sure the car would come back damaged He expected that but he hoped Garrison wouldn t get hurt Then he grew impatient It didn t matter to that guy how long he stayed out his wife wasn t waiting for him He said good night to the man in the garage told him to look out for a green hand and showed him where the bandages were Then for a bit of exercise he walked up to the Bronx taking a drink now and then to ease his mind It was two o clock when he opened the door of the little flat The kitchen was spotless the blue and white oilcloth shone like marble tiles There was a tray on the table with cold corned beef and three large baked potatoes the coffee was gurgling on the gas stove He devoured everything in sight washed up the dishes then went into the next room and stood at the bed Maudy was in a deep sleep how pretty she was She must have been very tired or she would have heard him come in She d been scrubbing that damn kitchen floor again She couldn t wait till Sunday morning that was his job He looked at her small hands They were rough from the washing soda and the nails were not manicured He had to kiss them he couldn t help it She opened her eyes smelt the hootch Tom you re going it you ll break your neck one night and I ll be a widow take a bath The sleepy eyes closed she dropped off again Tom put a roll of bills under her pillow slipped out of his clothes and fell on the sofa He didn t take a bath he d gotten over that pastime he had something better to do Floyd woke up the next morning his head aching his limbs weary The experience had battered his body but shook up his mind His share of the boodle lay on the table three five dollar bills He examined them curiously turning them over and over the first money he had ever earned Was it money No he threw away much more than that paltry sum every day But this was different he had worked for it with the sweat of his brow He felt the pressure of the masses who were earning their bread This meant money to them He remembered how the Colonel looked at him when he told him to sell something they were needing more and more You re destroying capital said the Colonel You should preserve it it s your only source of income Capital capital He wondered if they had blown in all his father had left blown in where into the air like soap bubbles which glittered for a moment in the sun then burst and disappeared He put his hand to his head Where could he go to pass the morning Julie was not visible until twelve She was lucky the day was only half as long for her Then that queer feeling came again he went to see Dr McClaren How s your wife said the doctor Very well as far as I can see I want to speak to you about myself my mind wanders I cannot concentrate nothing interests me I go back always to the past the things I have lived through haunt me You are trying too hard to forget I don t understand No you don t If we wipe out memory we throw into the dust heap of oblivion the best part of our life experience But if that experience is unbearable We can make it bearable We must work it the right way But I cannot see how Father Cabello spoke about the gift of forgetting The doctor smiled I am not for such narcotics We shouldn t go about hypnotizing ourselves A man of mind should be able to deal with the complications of his nature in an intelligent manner This meant nothing to Floyd the doctor was talking over his head I ll try to make it clearer to you You have got yourself tangled up What you think so terrible one day will be precious to you in years to come How do you stand financially I don t know I m not sure badly I think The doctor knew he had seen the Colonel I want you to try to get rich Floyd had a shock He looked sharply at the doctor there was no glare in his eyes but he was fingering a paper cutter no he wasn t mad but he was a mind reader Floyd had been thinking of money in a vague way wondering that so many people whose names he had never heard had bobbed up as millionaires The pursuit of wealth may be sordid but if we succeed we are compensated by a gratifying sense of self confidence authority power not speaking of the good we can do with our ill gotten gains As for the spiritual side being starved well we don t think so if we concentrate on the world of the spirit it will demoralize us in our practical life which is our end of it We must uphold that for the sake of bankrupt Europe Doctor I dreamt last night that I was enormously rich Good make it a complex It will drive more harmful ideas out of your mind Come and see me again I am curious to know how my prescription s going to work Floyd found the Colonel erect well satisfied he had no complexes he wasn t married How do I stand The Colonel hesitated Come out with it I want the truth Well you ll have to practice strict economy to make up for your enormous expenditure of the last few years Do you want to sell your house Economy Sell the house Julie impossible Nowadays a man can t live on interest Floyd snapped his fingers Economy bah We ll have to create new capital The Colonel opened a drawer took out a card of the Garrison estate kept as a physician does the history of a patient s disease then he placed a map on the table It was interlaced with red lines designating the shrinkage Floyd looked over it The entire water front is crossed off I see Yes the Martin Steele Corporation bought it for investment By the way that was a great thing young Steele did What thing He left his entire business to his employees equal shares and the money to keep it going Waldbridge told me about it with tears in his eyes the other day at the memorial service they gave for him Memorial service Didn t you know I saw Mrs Garrison there but she was gone before I could get through the crowd Julie there She hadn t told him He thought he knew all her movements It was wonderful I wouldn t have missed it for the world They are going to screen it It was a queer mixed crowd artists he had saved from starvation musicians he had sent abroad women he had started right they all got up and told their stories It was like a Christian Science service A man sang a barber named Hippolyte well known on Fifth Avenue a wonderful voice They say an opera manager has engaged him He sang psalms in Greek and Hebrew wails in the minor key just tore at your entrails He set them all crying One poor cripple made a scene swore he saw the dead man s spirit Of course that hypnotized the others they all saw it There was a tall man in a corner the light struck him for a moment I tell you Garrison I ve got the hide of a rhinoceros but it made my flesh creep Now there are two left of those river shanties we ll pull them down and build one big office building Floyd didn t hear him he was in the church listening to the voice of Hippolyte the cries the prayers for Martin the philanthropist the good man He forced himself to say something I knew Martin Steele all my life but had no idea of that side of him Nor I but most men keep the best part of them hidden Yes said Floyd tracing lines on the map I ll go down with you and look at those shanties I want money and lots of it every fool s got it I can be as big a fool as the next one The Colonel didn t contradict him but he doubted if Garrison would ever be that kind of a fool BOOK III Future the hidden meanings of Past and Present a dark picture Imagination flashes the light of Prophecy foretells life s realization or disillusion the Soul s victory or defeat Fiction my Masters All is Fiction BOOK III It took some years to become a rich fool but Garrison accomplished it He had no business ability at least that is what he told people and honestly believed it how could he he had never been in business He thought it well over and became what he had always condemned in others a gambler He risked every dollar he had and all he could borrow in hazardous real estate speculations It was touch and go many times as the values rose and fell They called him Lucky Garrison he knew better but there was a grim satisfaction in his success He realized as he had learnt to manipulate money that a man can attain nothing without it Other big interests developed Every bit of his energy came into play there was always some interesting thing coming up which led to great connections such as international finance and the like New deals got to be a necessary physical tonic like a cocktail before dinner and a strong cigar and black coffee after He scanned the morning paper at the breakfast table looking carefully over the financial news and rate of exchange We are sailing into prosperous times said he to Julie He was an optimist like all good American millionaires Julie had no opinion she smiled As Dr McClaren predicted her religious mania passed off she was now deeply interested in Art a patroness of the Museum and much sought after by budding talent Floyd encouraged this mania it was harmless There was a busy day before him a big deal to close he was in a hurry to get to his office She went with him to the door He looked up at the imposing staircase and beautiful Tiffany glass window He hated it once how could he have been so prejudiced It was all in the very best of taste Julie was perfectly framed in it I ll meet you at the Museum about five o clock we ll drive around for an hour I forgot to tell you I ve invited some men to dinner it s business Do you mind Julie smiled again Oh no With a sudden impulse he took her hand Are you happy Julie She looked at him what made him ask that Oh yes I have every reason to be Is there anything I can buy for you Nothing She stood watching him drive off and waved her hand It was well known in their circle that the Garrisons were a very devoted couple Floyd leaned back in the car puffing at a cigar The years had changed him the sensitive boy had become a man of affairs a Capitalist He was very sane his Puritan instincts rebelled against the rioting emotions of the Latins His life was made up of facts and figures ultimately he would have become an image of clay like his father s statues but there was a secret element of his life of which no one had the slightest clue The Past had ceased to torture him it became a consolation He lived over and over again the Romance of his youth the agony the passion his first years with Julie the rage of the murderer the whole tragedy but it didn t hurt him now Martin was dead forgiven We count the years we have lived to know how old we are correct mathematics but our age corresponds to other numbers Heart swings are the rhythm of our seasons recording in spiritual time the real life The car stopped in Twelfth Street Floyd jumped out stood for a moment looking up at the imposing twenty story office building which he had erected on the site of his old home It had rented well There was not a room empty He had retained an office for himself on the third floor He sat down to his desk read his mail He was about to sell the building the psychological moment had come to turn it over and get a handsome profit He never kept any real estate very long New York neighborhoods change and values fluctuate Then it occurred to him quite suddenly that the room in which he sat was about the height of his father s workshop in the little house where he was born There was no emotion but it was strange he had never thought of it before He looked at the heavy safe the walls lined with repositories where contracts were kept and saw clay images He looked down at his desk it was littered with old rags bits of arms legs a young man with an agonized face dropped a candle He smiled What courage youth has It was well done The home of his childhood was still his he had not desecrated it He saw Mary flying past him up the stairs she had become a world figure the head of an international organization of nurses When Julie s headaches came on Mary was always there He d go softly to the door and wait he didn t knock he knew she d come out Mrs Garrison is much better I m sure she ll be all right in the morning Then the worn face dim eyes streaked hair would vanish She stood again at the window in her bare room where they had loved each other for a moment The telephone at his elbow startled him Julie s voice would he order some flowers for the dinner table Certainly and a bunch for you Anything else Yes her tone became confidential What wine do you want served are the gentlemen heavy drinkers No but they ll take all you give them He dropped the receiver smiling How eager he used to be to do all those small errands the night of their house warming he drank too much That Swede was a nice man The den on the top floor was hung now with maps of suburban towns new fields for speculation he spent many evenings poring over them Somehow his business mind always worked well up there in that room where a man was murdered by his wife The stenographer put a paper before him He started came back to reality it was a bill of sale and very satisfactory I ll close the deal tonight Then he commenced searching in an old desk for some papers he wanted and came across a sealed envelope on it was written Boodle Boodle What did it mean He broke the seal and took out three five dollar bills Tom Dillon He had quite forgotten him but he had a vague idea that he owned a Taxi Company and was strong in local politics He put back the fifteen dollars resealed the envelope and wrote on it The foundation of the Garrison fortune He would give the story to his publicity man how an impoverished son of wealth started in life by earning fifteen dollars as a chauffeur Tom Dillon was the real thing What was the real thing Had he found it or was he chasing phantoms He had that feeling sometimes in his most successful moments it was a queer sensation as if he had caught a thing of vapor that melted out of hand and challenged him again from far off and again that shadow race He thought often of Tom Dillon after that and one election night he saw him in the crowd with a fine young fellow the image of his father they were laughing and nudging each other like two boy friends Floyd shook off a feeling of loneliness and got out of their way Julie was recovering from an attack which left her mentally exhausted She lay back in the sedan her deep rimmed eyes like smouldering coals She arrived at the Museum an hour before the time agreed on with Floyd wandered through the rooms making notes about the hanging and grouping of new pictures There was a small canvas in a corner which she thought was somewhat crowded in She asked about it It had been received very recently and was not yet catalogued Yes it was badly hung She sank down on a divan before the picture a Swiss landscape with a mountain background sloping down to a grassy plateau below a bank of mist through which could be distinguished an old chapel with a broken cross on top In a corner hardly visible to the naked eye she read Val Sinestra and underneath two letters M S She bent nearer looking eagerly into the picture Was it her imagination or did she really see a shadowy outline of a man with a white figure in his arms Martin Martin with flaming eyes distorted face desperate mad A charming picture isn t it like a Corot It s the first of this artist he s not known in America It was a member of the committee who spoke Then Floyd came up and introduced his business friends She smiled asked them if they had seen some gems in the next room and led them away from that picture in the corner On arriving home she went through the house looking for something and finally found it hidden away on a top shelf covered with dust it was a small glass vase with a delicate stem The engraving was beautiful like a white mist over it The butler washed it and held it up to the light colors flashed through it It s Bohemian glass Madame It will break easily No It s very strong I ve had it a long time She put it on her bed table with a dark red rose in it From that time the headaches were less frequent the ravings about punishment ceased Mary said to the doctor I think she s getting over those horrible nightmares I m glad of that said the doctor wearily He himself was suffering from an attack of nerves He was getting old and the hives of human bees he cared for didn t always contain honey They stung him at his patients table at births at marriages at deaths less so that was a release He fought them with his Scotch tenacity but they grew too much for him Finally he got rid of them by retiring from active practice and putting the whole bunch without names or dates into a book on psychical research which became celebrated Julie devoted much time to her boy took him in her car every morning to St John s College called for him in the afternoon preached religion to him at home warned him of the great evils which arise from lack of it She had been very negligent in her youth and was punished for it Religion was a great consolation He listened to her with deference He was extraordinarily gifted and devoured everything he could lay his hands on in the way of serious reading His father was proud of him but there was a growing sense of uneasiness about his religious studies He saw little of the boy who spent his evenings in his own room filled with books he had bought himself in the old book shops Floyd couldn t understand them The maps which hung on the walls of his den were more intelligible A distant cousin of Julie s came to America ostensibly on business The Bank taken over by the family had grown enormously rich under American management Mr Gonzola was highly cultured a dark handsome man with white hands and long tapering fingers He was delighted with the boy and his knowledge of international literature He found him reading Renan That s forbidden isn t it The boy answered with a gleam of humor Not forbidden but not taught I read all they recommend in school and all they forget out of it Then came a letter from Father Cabello to Julie He was very glad to hear that everything continued to be so satisfactory with her The wonderful gifts of her boy interested him he saw in his genius the hand of God leading him into the Divine path They must decide now about his career Julie handed the letter to Floyd who read it carefully and understood its hidden significance This means the priesthood Yes said Julie but don t speak of that to Joseph That evening at dinner she said Joseph would you like to go to Rome to visit Father Cabello The boy s eyes lit up Oh yes it s the dream of my life And I would like to go to Vienna to see your people Mr Gonzola spoke quietly his arm around the boy Let me take him Julie I promise you there will be no influence Our family has been split into different religious camps for generations those who have remained true to their faith have made no effort to bring the others back We do not proselytize The missionary is unknown to us Julie hesitated looked at Floyd it was a great responsibility The boy was bending over eagerly watching his father who decided quickly as was his way in business His theory was when a man weighs the pros and cons of an enterprise the difficulties grow so great that he generally ends in not undertaking it He would give the boy his chance he was old enough now to decide for himself Go with Mr Gonzola said Floyd The boy flung his arms around his father I will do what is right I m sure you will my boy answered Floyd At that moment he caught sight of Julie s face reflected in the mirror it was lit by a quick flash of joy When Father Cabello received a letter from Julie informing him Joseph had sailed with a Gonzola he proceeded at once to counteract any possible baleful influence He communicated with the Catholic members of the family in Vienna hinting that the boy was destined for the church This branch of the Gonzolas were devout Catholics generations old they welcomed Joseph affectionately and brought him as early as possible to Rome There he remained for some time a member of Father Cabello s household coming and going at will The priest watched waited the mind of the boy was not yet ripe for decision Joseph was dazzled with his first glimpse of the Pagan City its remains of Hellenic civilization the pomp and splendor of its churches the Cardinals in their decaying palaces clinging to the traditions of the Past the art of the great Masters those faithful servants of the Church with their wonderful portrayal of legendary religion The unearthly beauty of their divine types fired the boy s imagination stimulated him like rich wine tasted for the first time taken again in long draughts until his senses reeled The people fascinated him with their magnetism their emotional sensuality their worship of women symbolized in the Blessed Virgin and Child their passions jealousy hate revenge repentance He roamed day after day through the streets sat for hours in the churches listening to the chanting of the priests with a pleasant sense of drowsiness like the after effects of a narcotic He followed the processions of monks pilgrims peasants into churches away from churches sprinkling with holy water kissing burnt pieces of sacred wood and always that music Oh that music swelling in waves of overpowering sadness from the throats of unsexed men the terrible sweetness of it sucking him down into the waters of oblivion of self deception the soul in safety interceded for the load of personal responsibility fallen away care free on earth secure of Heaven an unutterable sense of rest from that torturing brain which keeps persecuting with its unceasing cry Think while tis day for the night cometh when no man can think In moments of realization he would say to the priest Father I am going to Vienna I must go The priest did not keep him back The boy must live through the inevitable experience of intoxication reaction submission He was travelling smoothly he would arrive safely When Joseph went from Rome to Vienna to visit the Gonzolas he was in a state of mental unrest and indecision The artist in him shrank from activity He was very sensitive he couldn t bear pain disappointment The Church would be a shelter from the materialism of the world It would be ideal to work for the poor The garb of piety appealed to his imagination a priest walking among the wretched the persecuted the unhappy giving everything his material wealth himself living a simple contemplative life The beauty of it all still remained with him keeping him in a semi intoxicated emotional state He thought of the works of immortal art created in the quiet of the cloister He was sorely tempted not by the flesh like St Anthony but by the spirit and the longing for release from a leaden sense of responsibility If not that what He saw nothing for him in the future His father had at least the satisfaction of success He himself had created his capital It was a game like racing roulette politics a game life a game what else what else It was all so ugly the yearning for beauty came again he was sorely tempted Mr Gonzola s wife and three daughters were models of domesticated womanhood Their home was very modern with just enough of the idealism of religion to give it spiritual charm The girls were well educated practical women keenly alive to the responsibility of their wealth full of enthusiasm and hope for the future of the world They received Joseph with great cordiality helped him perfect his German and were silently sympathetic toward his unsettled spiritual condition of mind Mrs Gonzola was one hundred per cent maternal she mothered her husband her daughters her friends her poor and any stray animal who instinctively came to her for shelter Joseph was her life s crowning joy the realization of a hope long dead a son She found him too thin too pale poor boy he had never known the cuisine of Israel the finest in the world No Cordon bleu can equal the Jewish mother who cooks with the subtlety and cleanliness of religious tradition and puts into her cakes the honey of love This healthy sane atmosphere was a good tonic for Joseph s over excited mind Mr Gonzola s ethics were very simple He kept the two principles of life wide apart and gave to God what was His to men what was theirs He was an able man of business and did not consider a good bargain with legitimate profit ungodly Sometimes he had an uneasy feeling the religious ground was slipping like sand from under his feet He said to Joseph with a sigh I do not live up to ritual laws as strictly as I should My daughters won t let me but I am going to take you to Frankfort to visit the head of the family Pedro Gonzala who has preserved the original spelling of our name and the tradition of our ancestors In his home you will see pure orthodoxy but don t forget the responsibility is on my shoulders I have given my word to your mother and I want to keep it if possible Joseph laughed Mr Gonzola was an honest man The family of bankers with branches all over the world were assembled this year in Frankfort Pedro Gonzala despite his great age was consulted about every detail by the young men of the firm from fifty years old and upward The children under fifty stood meekly silent and listened to warnings against the ardor of youth and the temptation of speculative times The house of Gonzola had braved many storms was sometimes drawn into international financial catastrophes but it had always kept its honor unimpeached and continued to live up to its reputation as creditors of the world These cold men of finance led a dual existence When they stepped over the thresholds of their palatial homes the world outside was forgotten They lived their religious life with extreme exactness Their wives and daughters were faithful to the Law in their domestic life their marriage life and in the education of their children They were the remains of a vanishing caste which lived upon its own fanaticism When Joseph first met Pedro Gonzala in his private office he saw a very old man wearing a black silk skull cap otherwise well groomed and modern in appearance He was seated at his desk surrounded by the members of the firm who listened to him with great respect The old gentleman came to business every day in his carriage although he had many cars but was never known to ride in them He was interested in the breeding of horses frequented the races and patronized art music and the theatre Most of his time was devoted to philanthropic enterprises but he kept a firm hand on the ship of finance of which he remained until the end of his life the undisputed head He questioned Joseph about his mother remarking upon the success of the Gonzola bank in New York He knew all about lucky Garrison who had shown himself very able He invited Joseph to dinner at his home The Gonzala mansion was sheltered from the gaze of the curious by a closely planted row of very old trees whose entwined branches symbolized the unity of the family a treasure house of antiques from all parts of the world collected with taste and discernment by each succeeding generation The picture gallery was celebrated for its rare masterpieces Joseph took great delight in a corner of family portraits But the most cherished treasure of Pedro Gonzala s home was Ruth his granddaughter just approaching womanhood she was all that was left of his immediate family The World War had swept the younger men away He had lived ten years longer than the allotted Biblical time he was life worn but before he went to his long rest his little Ruth must be married to a righteous man a student of the Talmud and of equal birth Such a one was difficult to find Pedro Gonzala stood in the grand salon surrounded by beautiful dark eyed women and serious men of finance He welcomed Joseph in the name of the family as a great grandson of that learned man and deep thinker Joseph Abravanel who fought with all his strength against the wave of assimilation which had engulfed his immediate family You my boy are in the third generation of those who were led away from the old tradition it is not your fault but no student or thinker can afford to neglect the study of a race which gave to the world the first revelation of one God Hebrew thought in its inception its ethics its morals is the pure wine of religion in America they have thinned it with the water of reform and put it into fine looking bottles with gold labels There was a ripple of applause the old gentleman told his little jokes like an actor expecting response which the family gave at the proper time then he related the oft repeated story of his youth when his dear Sarah God rest her soul was alive He led the boy before a portrait painted by Rembrandt representing a stately handsome matron At a ball in Paris given to them by the diplomats and aristocrats of France there were rumors of war and much disquietude He himself was absent called away to a serious Cabinet consultation The guests crowded about Mrs Gonzala who was gracious and smiling Are you not worried Madame asked a celebrated diplomat Oh No laughed Mrs Gonzala I am certain there will be no war because I will not permit my husband to lend the money for it Ruth stepped daintily down the marble staircase Her grandfather had bade her array herself It was a gala occasion the reunion of the family and a welcome to a young Gonzola from America Around her neck were rows of costly pearls diamonds sparkled in her hair she wore a cape of ermine a young queen of an old dynasty an inheritance of beauty and purity She put out her hand to Joseph and said Welcome cousin Joseph raising her face to his He bent down and kissed her cheek they stood looking at each other speechless The women nudged each other What an ideal couple they might have been it was a great pity The long dinner table was a beautiful picture with its service of gold priceless glass and fine linen and the Patriarchal figure at its head Ruth sat beside him I am dazzled said Joseph such lovely women such jewels such wealth We are not wealthy answered Ruth because it is a principle of the family to give away a large part of its income and you will see that we live very simply but tonight all this is in your honor Our jewels furs laces have come down to us from generations back our home and pictures can never be sold unless the business goes under and that will never happen I hope not said Joseph it has meant too much to the world but all these jewels must have been bought once Oh yes in the times of the Ghetto when the Jews were not allowed to own real estate so they bought jewels and hung them around the necks of their wives who wore them in secret and gave them to their daughters and daughters daughters This has an interesting history She touched a necklace of shining pink living things lying against her white skin When the Romans separated Queen Berenice from her kingly lover the last thing he did was to throw these pearls around her neck She went back to her own dominion and the pearls after her death became the property of the Temple We have had them in our family for many generations He bent down to examine the pearls but his gaze stopped at her soft dark eyes And you will give them to your daughter Yes said Ruth but I don t think I shall ever marry Why insisted Joseph Because her voice dropped he bent lower to listen I can only marry one of my own faith they are all dying out They have forgotten their ancestry Father Cabello had reached the zenith of his earthly ambition the Cardinalate He had easily won in the race for advancement a man of wealth and winning personality The magic word America gave him prestige it was a sign of goodwill to the church in the United States The priest was generally beloved his doors were always open to the poor to whom he gave liberal hands they crowded the steps of his house penetrated into his apartments All efforts of his attendants to keep them away was futile Let them in said the Father they will be my future associates for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven His secretary a member of an old patrician family shrugged his shoulders his unspoken thought was if I have to live with them in Heaven I hope I ll never die The Cardinal had been confined to his room for some days with an attack of weakness the result of an overtaxed heart The doctor said to him Your Eminence you must shun all excitement no more receptions no more arduous night work no activity of any kind The Cardinal smiled That would be premature death I must take my chances But at present I cannot work I have no strength His new honors had not changed his mode of living His palazzo a relic of past grandeur was simply furnished with only the necessary chairs and tables and completely bare of drapery or superfluous decorations The Roman sun flooded his rooms through the high arched windows The garden of boxwood hedges and old trees was beautiful and fragrant he could stand on his terrace and see the cupolas and innumerable spires of the city of churches and listen to the bells pealing now soft caressing pleading now loud harsh commanding those eternal bells that have welcomed into the world and followed out of it millions of souls The Cardinal sat in his private apartment His fingers tapped nervously on the polished wood of the table upon which was a dish of fruits figs honey and a silver jug of iced water a habit he had brought from the land of his adoption He was waiting for Joseph In the excitement of his new honors weeks had passed with only now and then the accustomed epistolary greetings but the time was approaching to speak of the future If he could realize his plan thought out in every detail this boy would inherit his wealth would carry on his work among the poor A spasm of agony turned his lips blue his face livid He quickly dropped a tablet into a glass of water and swallowed it The unbearable pain slowly subsided the brain moved again If God would be merciful and let him live to see the boy ordained A flash of determination of invincible Will Yes it would be It must be He forgot the dark cornered room he saw the cathedral the procession of priests the young divine Why didn t the boy come He was eager to stamp his plan with the seal of realization A shaft of sunlight shooting through the window struck the chair opposite him His sick heart bounded Seated there he saw his old friend and enemy Joseph Abravanel He slowly made his way to the chair passing his hand over it it was empty His thought had conjured up a momentary vision How often had they sat like that opposite each other at a table set with fruit and wine the long evening passing like a flash over the chess board which became symbolical of the spiritual struggle between them The tenacity of that old man who would not give up hope even after the conversion of his daughter You have won this time but there is the next generation When Julie was born he was cheated again in this game for souls but he would not give in God s chosen people cannot die they may lose the path but they will find it again they will come back in the third generation A spasm of fear convulsed the priest Joseph Abravanel had the prophetic clairvoyance of his race No No The boy was a good faithful child of the Church a believer in the true Faith He glanced again at the chair opposite again he met those eyes long extinct spirit eyes The servant announced Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison Joseph threw himself with a gush of irresistible love into the old man s arms then remembering he dropped on his knees and kissed the ring of His Eminence The Cardinal raised him looking long into that mobile face aglow with the joy of life Sit down Joseph we have much to talk over No no not there here He pointed to a chair close beside him there were three now at the table indomitable spirits one invisible The Cardinal felt his way asked about the family he had not heard from Julie for some time Oh Mother is a bad correspondent but if I miss a mail she cables His laughter rang through the high vaulted room Father wants me to go into the banking business the Gonzolas think I have talent for it He was peeling an apple careful not to break the ring the Cardinal noticed his long tapering fingers his white hands Well what do you think about it The boy s eyes shot a mischievous gleam Our great ancestor on my father s side was a baker on my mother s side they added a letter to it and it became banker Now if it is true that the third generation goes back I think I d rather make cakes than money The Cardinal laughed the boy s merriment was contagious Then he grew grave again My son there is something in each generation which belongs neither to the Past nor the Present but to the Future it is God s will working in us The time has come to tell you of my wishes for you I want you to continue my work to take up the staff of Divine Duty to lay upon the altar of renunciation the great gifts bestowed upon you by an All Seeing God you will give your youth your manhood your old age to save those helpless souls who need your intercession your spiritual support You will one day succeed me in Rome it has been my only earthly dream ever since I held you as an infant in my arms My time is short I want to see you enter upon the path before I die The boy was on his feet his face quivering with grief the tears streaming from his eyes No no you must not die I love you I love you If I could prolong your life for one hour I would give my right hand He held it up firm strong beautiful The Cardinal s imagination played him a trick again He saw another white hand held up old feeble trembling the light shone through it The boy s heart was heavy that beloved face before him with the pallor of death on it How could he say what he must I have thought long and deeply of your wishes for me I cannot I cannot There is something in me that rebels against the chastisement of the flesh I don t want to think always of death to pray always I want to work I want to live No one can intercede for me I can intercede for no one Each must work out his own salvation The old world is spiritually decaying the young must be the pioneers of a new world We must tear down and dig and set the stones of a new foundation and those who come after us will build The Future will see miracles the human being will awaken to the truth that he himself is God Stop Blasphemer The old man broke into choking sobs Joseph Joseph I am responsible for your soul s salvation this is all madness You will repent when it is too late Father it hurts me to give you pain but it is impossible I cannot I cannot The Cardinal was cold to the soul his boy his heart s idol a heretic an infidel the stripling was strange to him standing there with a look in his face of iron determination He would break that will he must You do not know what you are doing You are too young You have been influenced by that old sophisticated fox Pedro Gonzala I fought a greater man than he and won I will fight again I will save you as I saved your mother No No They have not influenced me I have given up dogma I will not be chained again by ritual I will not be a mummy wrapped in the superstition of past ages I am a living thinking being I am free free The priest s eyes went past him to that shadowy figure looking down now as it had so often done in life at a chess board on the table fingering the pieces moving removing trying new combinations Neither had won it was a drawn game stalemate With a low moan he sank back in his chair The boy gave a cry of terror Father speak to me Speak to me The priest heard him not He had renounced this world for the glory of the next He was going to his reward where there would be no dogma no ritual no religion A terrible fear clutched the boy He looked about despairingly He was forsaking the shelter of those old walls He had stripped himself bare He must go out naked to meet the stones of the Philistines He threw himself down before the beloved guide of his childhood sobbing out his love his loneliness Come back Come back Don t leave me I am afraid afraid He called in vain those wonderful dreams the hope of immortality the joy of Heaven would never come back they had gone into the past like that still form deaf to his entreaties to his cries gone forever Mr Garrison was getting into his coat in the hall it was after nine Good bye Julie I m off Her answer came from above Don t go yet I want to speak to you it is something important With a suppressed feeling of impatience he took off his coat and went up the stairs He wondered how much Julie would ask for She was very extravagant He was surprised to find her waiting at the door of the sitting room for him She had slipped out of bed and thrown on a filmy wrapper he was struck anew by her youthfulness Her skin was like satin She was forty and could easily be taken for ten years younger but her beauty had ceased to disturb him It was an accepted fact like his luck in business As he bent to kiss her she noticed his hair was getting thin on the top He would soon be bald He dropped down on the sofa beside her You looked tired this morning didn t you sleep well said Julie As well as usual Floyd s mind was overstrained his accumulating interests kept him on a severe tension His eyes troubled him and he wore strong owl like spectacles framed in tortoise shell which gave him a look of comic solemnity He didn t tell Julie how very badly he slept his many speculations took gibbering forms and danced around his pillow He spent whole nights in his den where a man had sweated blood He was beginning to feel the significance of that expression At first the thought of possessing a million made his head reel now he laughed at his modest pretensions Desire grows until it ceases to be servant and becomes master He hunted gain like a gambler who risks his last dollar Envious competitors said Garrison s getting to be a skin flint he d sell his soul for money It came back to him from a friend he wasn t annoyed but wondered in a vague way if it were really true When the news arrived of Cardinal Cabello s sudden death and Joseph s decision Julie took it very hard she spent days in the convent praying for her son s soul Floyd consulted with Dr McClaren She ll get over it It s only a temporary disturbance A bit of good news now will set her all right again And how are you Mr Garrison My medicine worked well I see Oh yes said Floyd but times are bad a man must be careful how he invests his money That never troubles me I haven t any to invest You ve been a successful doctor haven t you I hope so The trouble with Dr McClaren was that his bills were ridiculously small He underestimates his own ability said Floyd to Julie A man must set the price of his life s work and as he appraises himself the world values him I have a letter from Joseph answered Julie So have I he keeps me well posted on complications abroad I am sure if he will only get down to it he ll make a first class financier This was Floyd s ambition for his son She took a letter from the table beside her It was long covering many sheets of paper The Gonzalas have been very good to him he is in much better spirits It was terrible that struggle with His Eminence I would have given in She always thought now of Cabello as His Eminence in glittering robes sparkling with jewels Yes said Floyd You always gave in That was the trouble He turned to go Stop a moment you must hear this He pushed away the call of business he would rather have read it himself when he found time at luncheon perhaps He hated to be read to He couldn t concentrate his mind wandered off in figures She read in a low voice very rapidly stopping now and again he knew she was skipping something he wasn t offended He had always felt like a third party and thought of Joseph as Julie s boy It was an interesting letter written in picturesque metaphors just the way Julie s mother used to speak thought Floyd The boy told of his many visits to Frankfort and of closer acquaintance with Pedro Gonzala and his granddaughter They had given a costume ball to celebrate her sixteenth birthday A costume ball that s rather sporty remarked Floyd He had in mind those French masquerades given in his youth where Martin danced the Can Can with indecent French women Oh no answered Julie listen Joseph explains it This was a ball where the family personated their ancestors the portraits in the gallery Ruth took me around told me their history for generations back Wonderful so full of struggle tragedy romance I couldn t hear enough of it It didn t affect me like that those portraits you sent away gave me a cold chill They were not your ancestors said Julie with a touch of sarcasm Then she went on reading They called one of the portraits the unhappy Pedro Gonzala because he was an illegitimate son That was Grandfather I couldn t tear myself away from him he had such brave defiant eyes Dearest Mother I think it is a great injustice to brand a human being like that There is nothing illegitimate in Nature I d rather be the child of love than of calculation born in wedlock Floyd frowned I don t approve of those views I m afraid the boy is catching European radicalism Julie didn t answer she was absorbed in the letter Floyd looked at his watch and jumped up Wait wait it is not finished Mother I ve written you often about Ruth but I m sure you don t know what she is like When I am with her I m afraid to look at her and when I m away I can t imagine how she looks She s something indescribable Mother I have fought with all my might against her because I knew it was hopeless but when she said she loved me I went straight to her grandfather I told him about the struggle with my conscience and our dear friend s sudden death he was very much moved and put his hand over my head and blessed me then I took courage and asked him for Ruth He was silent a long time before he answered I could see he was thinking deeply Then he said The uncompromising adherence of our people to the Law in the days of the Ghetto preserved the virility of the Race but today our blood is in the veins of the world That obstinate orthodoxy with which we are reproached has saved us from being swept away in a great tidal wave of assimilation Come to us We will leave you free in all worldly matters but you must live according to our ritual you must worship in our synagogue you must bring up your children in our tradition You will realize as you get older the righteousness of my demands Floyd was annoyed They will keep harping on those future generations How can we lay down the law for our grandchildren they ll know a lot more than we do Julie evidently didn t agree she kept on reading I walked about for days trying to find some way I wanted Ruth Mother you don t know how much I couldn t keep away from her she was waiting for me in the garden she knew I would come Mother there was something so pure about her such sweetness I have never seen in any human thing She was pale but she spoke quietly Joseph I know what Grandfather has asked you to do for my sake you mustn t do it It wouldn t be right for you We try to bring the Past into the Present to preserve our religion We think we live but it is only a waking dream and we are happy they let us dream but dreams are not for you Joseph you must go out on the high road of Progress and I I must stay here with my grandfather Then I fell into the depths of despair and cried how I cried I won t let you it is a living death you are young young Mother I ll never forget her face when she answered I look young but my soul is old A sob choked Julie s voice herself at sixteen with that old soul Floyd took the letter and read it rapidly to the finish She has shown me the way it is all clear to me now and I am not unhappy We are only separated for a little while and Mother I want you to write a letter to her grandfather and plead for us It might do some good You are always asking me what I want I want Ruth give me Ruth It was pathetic how the boy clung to his childish illusions His mother could give him everything Julie was crying silently The letter dropped from Floyd s hand waves of memory swept over him The struggle between Joseph Abravanel and Father Cabello against him the bitterness the tragedy He was on his feet there was a youthful ring in his voice which had long been absent He flung his spectacles that badge of age on the table His eyes were young again We must bring it about the boy must not be disappointed He must have his love dream he must not lose the best part of his life With a cry of joy Julie came to him and put her arms around his neck they stood together the light of that young romance across the sea reflected in their faces Floyd bent down and whispered I was an ardent lover wasn t I Julie You were so sweet so sweet Then he remembered a business deal and put on his spectacles At the door he stopped I shall write at once to Pedro Gonzala and make him a business proposition which it would be madness to refuse it will be a brilliant future for Joseph This will cure him He will see now that money can buy him everything Don t cry Julie it s all for the best and don t miss the mail It s a five cent stamp to Germany The Colonel lunched that day at the club with Floyd who was full of his plan to dazzle the Gonzolas The Colonel was very sympathetic then he said with a touch of sadness I m getting old People have no use for a bachelor when he ceases to be eligible If I had a boy like yours a wife like yours I d be a happy man Floyd thought a moment I have been lucky I come out well from very serious complications The Colonel thought he meant business deals You often risked too much you were once on the brink of disaster More than once answered Floyd but now things seem to be going my way I would like to do some philanthropic construction work a man must have something to keep him from drying up There was a responsive flash from the Colonel I thought I was the only one who thought like that Floyd looked around at the crowded room there was laughter jingling of glasses the perfume of good tobacco I think they all do Joseph had spent the winter in Geneva studying the classic and modern languages In the spring he joined a band of students on a walking tour through the mountains At Tarasp he bade them good bye he was going to see the Val Sinestra where his mother years before had been caught in a storm and where his father s best friend his Uncle Martin had been lost in the mountains He passed the hotel climbed down into the ravine and stood before the little chapel where by a strange coincidence they had met Father Cabello He pushed open the door How old it was how very old the fading wall pictures the broken windows the time stained Virgin and Child looming up out of the shadows There was a sudden impulse to go to her to speak to her as he used to when she was living to him He gazed and gazed she was drawing him down the aisle He went out shutting the door softly behind him Ghosts followed him as he climbed up the open road then they melted away in the warm sunlight He was soon going home His father s dazzling business proposition had been enthusiastically received by the younger Gonzolas but the old gentleman remained obdurate The boy must accept his conditions Floyd had written to Joseph advising him to give in while the old man lived But Joseph refused to make any concession Ruth wouldn t let him He strolled along his knapsack on his back his hat and cape in his belt a handsome young student one meets them often in the mountains fine happy lads their only wealth the Future He knelt down by a stream caught the falling water in his hands and drank it then he poetized Spring dances in the mountains Winter s young daughter peeps at her Sweet face in the Lake mirror The old Snow man growls His blanket is thin his feet stick out They are warm he is melting He flies to the heights in his March wind aeroplane There he can keep cool The bride robes herself in Green and gold Flowers fall from her long curls The nuptial couch is white With blossoms Wedding bells birds caroling Cattle calls Alpine horns Love time He threw back his head and laughed Ruth would like it He would bring her and show her where he wrote it on their wedding day He read it again it was a whimsical thing He was sorry for the poets of the past who were chained in rhyme The world had been rhyming so long about everything love religion the soul the origin of man People rhymed themselves into a state of poetic fiction then suddenly they found out it was all rhyme and no reason The path ran along the side of the mountain In the valley below he saw people running heard the sound of music in the distance He stopped a barefoot boy who told him it was f te day in the Canton to welcome their great Switzer home from Geneva the artist Staehli Staehli Yes I know I admired his paintings at the exhibition Then he saw a procession of peasants in gala array cows adorned with flowers maidens singing dancing A tall man walked amongst them with swinging step a peasant like the others He puts his hand to his mouth and gives out a long piercing yodel Above at a ch let a woman answers That is Angela his wife she is the doctor of the Dorf she heals with her hands and brews herb tea which has a magic power Oh I d like to meet the artist Do you think he ll receive me Oh yes All are welcome they have the best milk and cheese in the village I ll take you down Near the ch let they were stopped by an enormous hay wagon drawn by oxen The young peasant leading them moved aside smiling at Joseph That s Martin Staehli born and raised here said the boy The artist was standing outside the ch let watching the procession wind its way around the path and out of sight Could I rest here awhile I ve walked from Tarasp I shall have great pleasure He spoke English hesitatingly with a Swiss accent They entered a very large room the light streaming in from all sides This is my studio My home is a little distance away in our family ch let It is old I will show it to you if you are interested in antiques He went to the door and called Angela Angela He looked keenly at the boy You are not a European No I am an American He raised his head with a gesture of pride which became him well My name is Joseph Abravanel Gonzola Garrison The artist put his hand over his eyes Julie s boy The child he had held in his arms He heard again that sweet young voice felt the soft lips pressed against his I love you Uncle Martin Julie s boy Angela came in with milk bread and cheese Joseph thought she was the noblest looking woman he had ever seen The artist sat tracing lines on paper He must hold that vision of the past it would soon vanish Angela apologized for his silence My husband is sketching you he loves beautiful heads Joseph sat willingly for the artist It s only for myself and for you if you will accept it Then pointing to a black band around the boy s arm he said with a touch of fear Are you in mourning Yes for our dearest friend Cardinal Cabello Cabello a Cardinal I am quite out of the world I met him many years ago in America He helped my mother bring me up I was like his own son I had to grieve him terribly before his death but I couldn t help it I must go soon again to Rome there is a large sum of money coming to the Church from my grandmother It was left to me conditionally I have forfeited it Don t look so sad said the artist I want the brightness of you Tell me have you sisters and brothers No I am an only child and very much spoilt Your parents are they living Oh yes and still young My mother is the most beautiful woman in New York The artist caught the smile then set him talking again looking keenly into his face with its quick changes its light and shade He laughed often he would throw back his head with a gush of merriment That laugh thrilled the artist it was like a far away echo it played on the chord of remembrance bringing out a melody long unheard You are not of pure American stock Oh yes my mother and grandmother were born there Mother is of Spanish Hebrew blood Father is of Dutch extraction he is proud of being pure American he forgets the Indian All others are of emigrant origin only some came over on earlier ships A European called us a melting pot I hate that expression people don t melt We are not a smelting furnace To me the United States is like a big Colonial mansion with many windows made up of little panes of glass which I call Race Each one colors his glass with his own racial impulse What color do you see Oh my window looks toward the East where the sun rises it is gorgeous with many colors laughed the boy I think I catch your meaning It would make a good symbolical picture A great prairie and standing in it a White House built on Colonial lines It is flooded with a glare of strong light which in the individual separates into its prismatic colors the different races Yes that s what I mean only an artist could think it out like that Will you paint it Perhaps some day but why not you You have the instinct in you I feel it The boy s face lit up How strange you should know that I love art I ve studied it in Paris I ve been dabbling a bit in oil They say I have talent The man bent forward I have a class of young artists in Geneva they are all unusually gifted Join us How eager he was he hung on to the boy s answer I would like it but an artist s career is too passive for me I have no patience I want action results I want to work for the great World Reformation which is coming I want to help bring down to this miserable unhappy earth a little of the Heaven we have been dreaming of so long We must wake up We must commence now and fight the monster of materialism which is destroying us He was on his feet his head erect his eyes blazing A young David sharpening his sword for the great encounter with the Giant of superstition lies false Gods I must go now May I come again I m going to write all about you to my mother Were you here that time they were caught in the storm Angela put her hand on her husband s shoulder He started looked up I was in America I was very unfortunate there I often lost my way in jungles Race instinct made me restless The peasant blood was strong in me Race instinct repeated the boy I ve felt that but I didn t know what it was stirring in me I can t express it It was like a melody from far far away coming back in snatches like like the strains of a National Hymn It excites me Angela s eyes shone You are living a great romance the romance of race The romance of race yes that s what it is Then he came nearer to them and told his love story Ruth is to me not only my love she is the ideal in my life I am going to take her out of that beautiful dark house with its old portraits I am going to make her soul young again The artist went with him down the path to the bend of the road Where shall I send the sketch To the College in Geneva Would you mind if I gave it to my mother Oh no I will try to make it beautiful Joseph lingered looking again into the artist s face with a touch of sadness I feel as if I had known you a very long time You have He drew the boy to him and kissed him and stood watching the young figure until it disappeared Angela touched his arm Angela that boy that boy Is he the son of the unhappy man who spent the night here Yes The young peasant sent out a call from the barn where he was flinging the hay lightly with a heavy pitchfork into the loft What are you going to do with our boy He does not care for books he has no talent for painting You are not ambitious for him There was a note of reproach in her voice Yes very ambitious I want him to be what nature has made him a peasant nothing could be nobler That night the artist remained in his studio to finish the sketch he worked for hours with intense concentration until the pencil dropped from his numb fingers Then he threw himself down on the couch but couldn t rest Ashes strewn over the fire had smothered but not extinguished it the flames broke through That boy The Past living again with all its wonder of passion its uncontrollable love He went to the window leaned out a white mist hovered over the dark valley His eyes pierced it deeper He was again a desperate man holding a woman in his arms Mad Martin When the sketch was finished he painted it on ivory framed it in silver put it in a velvet case and sent it to Joseph as a souvenir of their meeting It was a speaking likeness it went over the sea a message to his first love The Garrisons were at home The reception tonight was in honor of a distinguished Englishman Julie stood before the mirror putting the last touches to her toilette she wore a creamy lace d collet gown with splashes of red velvet The Gonzola diamonds glittered in her corsage Her maid handed her a letter and package It was from Joseph now the evening would be perfect The boy was full of hope enthusiasm he had just returned from Switzerland where he saw the Val Sinestra and the old chapel she had told him about when he was a child at night before he went to sleep I visited an artist who lives near there He s been in America he didn t say much about himself but he drew me out to get atmosphere for a portrait he made of me which I am sending to you with my best love I am writing him a long letter I hope he will answer He s married to a wonderful woman they say she has magnetic power and it is true she drew out all my secrets I had to tell her about Ruth She loves her husband with her whole soul her eyes never leave him They have a son a big strong peasant lad Mother the artist is the most interesting man I have ever met his hair is turning gray He must have had a terrible struggle when he was young I think he starved he has deep lines in his face I had to tear myself away I love him Mother I love him and I m sure he loves me When I left he put his arms around me and kissed me I felt his heart beating in big throbs Martin s heart beats She opened the package Joseph laughed back at her She gazed and gazed until the young face vanished and she saw Martin with her boy in his arms She sank down in her chair in a rush of hysterical joy Martin alive Happy no no not happy content peaceful at work How wonderful Those two had met they loved each other God had given her absolution How thankful she was how thankful She sprang up peered into the mirror and saw a white despairing face with spotted gray unkempt hair it faded slowly youth had touched it A beautiful smiling woman was reflected there with head erect triumphant free from that haunting fear of years She put out the lights and went to the door with resilient steps then stopped suddenly grew pale as she looked back The room was shadowy one lamp shone down on the little table beside her bed bringing out in sharp relief the torn old Hebrew prayer book beside it an ivory crucifix turning yellow and a beautiful rose eternally young symbols of her soul s secrets its melody its madness Finis TRANSCRIBER S NOTES Italicized text is surrounded by underscores italics Obvious typographical errors have been corrected Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized
