hired killer from Callisto was strictly out for Pappas out for Number One as they used to say And now those fools in the vanishing spaceship thought that number was up Transcriber s Note This etext was produced from Planet Stories May Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U S copyright on this publication was renewed Nick Pappas had just crossed to the instrument panel of the Tang Chuh Chih s lifeboat when he heard a sound behind him He turned quickly He had left the airlock between the lifeboat and the ship open That had been stupid he realized but it was too late to correct it now One of the Tang s two other crew members was approaching down the corridor just beyond the airlock if he saw the doors slide shut now he d be immediately suspicious That would leave Pappas inside the lifeboat and before he could drain enough fuel from the ship s tanks into the lifeboat s the other two could have the airlock cut open He still had a chance to hide but before he could propel himself to the other end of the lifeboat out of sight Arne Birkerod appeared at the other side of the open airlock Birkerod smiled Pappas stood still gripping the pilot s seat in front of him Hello Arne said Pappas I was just checking over the Good morning Nick or good evening if you like Let s go up to the control cabin and see Garcia For a very brief moment Pappas considered Although the Tang was in free fall he was very conscious of the weight of the gun concealed inside his jacket He might use it now but the sound would bring Garcia Better to bluff it through The other two might not be suspicious yet and in a pinch he had the advantage that they weren t armed Sure he said and pushed himself across to where Birkerod stood After you said Birkerod much more politely than usual Pappas smiled uncertainly He planted both feet against the side of the airlock opening then jumped off He floated down the ship s corridor to where it took a sharp bend there he grabbed a rung of a ladder bolted to the corridor wall Birkerod had pushed off harder than Pappas had he arrived at the ladder at the same time After you he said again Pappas saw at the end of the long corridor ahead the open door to the control cabin He pushed off in that direction Yusuf Garcia was in the ship s pilot s seat Garcia was half Brazilian and half Malagasy His eyes had a strong green tint which looked strange against the deep brown black of his face Pappas had always been a little afraid of him and the present situation didn t help that any there was a gun in Garcia s hand Birkerod followed Pappas in taking a seat facing Garcia What did you find Yusuf he asked casually Well Arne I haven t finished checking up on our little conjecture the calculator over there is still working on it But while I was waiting I looked through our friend Pappas s locker You may already have noticed what I found He waved the gun Where did you find our friend by the way Birkerod smiled First place I looked The lifeboat Yeah What was he doing Nothing I think I know how our little conjecture s going to turn out though He turned to Pappas who had followed the exchange tensely You know Nick my father was a fellow countryman of yours back on Earth Countryman That s right He lived just north of Winnipeg My mother was a Canadian too Both of them were in the second batch of colonists that left for Callisto But it doesn t mean much to call you a Canadian any more does it Garcia and you and I we re all Callistans now Sure said Pappas wondering Callisto A cold world A small new world and a cold world and incredibly distant from the planet that had evolved its settlers In the thirty years since the exploration of Jupiter s satellites had begun Callisto had had a very different history from the rest On Ganymede a hundred or so engineers had been working all that time on the tremendous task of raising the satellite s mean temperature to the point where an atmosphere could be provided and open air cities and farms built in which Earthmen could live The smaller satellites had been largely ignored But it had been found that Callisto had large deposits of ore of such quality that in spite of the tremendously long haul required to carry anything from there to the inner planets it was worth while beginning mining operations Up went the insulated airtight domes out came the colonists down went the mine shafts It was a hard life Crystalline rock was cut by machines at the mine faces and by the time other machines had brought it up the shafts to the surface level in the domes it had become amorphous and powdery its crystalline structure destroyed by being heated to twenty degrees below zero Centigrade When you repaired machinery below the surface you wore sixty kilograms of spacesuit Earth weight and a failure of any item of equipment or a fumble by any member of your crew might mean sudden death The walls of the dome shut you in from the sky for the vacuum out there was death too when you did get up to the observatory to see the sky you saw Jupiter weirdly streaked with brilliant color if your dome was on the side of Callisto toward Jupiter Otherwise you looked across twenty million kilometers of vacuum to the nearest star It was a hard life and no life for a lone wolf There were no homestead farms to be settled by lonely pioneer families Callisto was a sterile place and to keep life going there at all men had to work together Cooperation was a lesson Earth civilization had learned only after thousands of years of oppression and war a lesson that had to be learned before men could cross space and a lesson that was very difficult to forget on Callisto At least for most people Rita and Cliff Belden had control of the trade between Callisto and the inner planets It didn t start as control though the way it began was this Once the colony had been well established its operation was left completely up to the Callistans who shipped as much of their goods to Earth as they could manage and requisitioned as much food and supplies from Earth as they needed which was really the best way The inner planets could not very well take part in the planning of Callisto s activities since there was no radio contact and the trip took over two months by freighter even when the relative positions of the planets in their orbits was most favorable One freighter shuttled back and forth between No Dome on Callisto at one end and any of several inner planet ports at the other Rita and Cliff Belden were the two Callistans whose job it was to run that freighter The little colony was absolutely dependent on the supplies they brought This fact was obvious to everybody but the Beldens made a deduction from it which was unprecedented on Callisto they could threaten to withhold the supplies and thereby force the rest of the colonists to agree to whatever they asked provided they could make the threat stick They made the attempt On one of their trips back from Earth they put the ship into an orbit around Callisto instead of landing and announced they would not land until their henchmen on Callisto were in control And the henchmen did a thorough job of taking control All the details were taken care of They quickly seized the radio transmitters that maintained contact with Ganymede they confiscated all the reserves of spaceship fuel they could find they clamped down as tightly as they could on communication between the domes then they started keeping a close check on every tool that could be used as a weapon There was just one place they slipped up Their search for fuel wasn t good enough The people of No Dome pooled the fuel they had hidden from the Beldens they seized from the Beldens guards the Dome s tiny spaceship which had been assembled on Callisto and which had never been intended to leave the Jupiter system and they sent the ship off for Venus with Garcia and Birkerod aboard Venus was the only possible destination with the planets positions in their orbits as they were then to reach Earth or Mars would have taken either more fuel than they had or much more time than they could spare As it was the trip took eight months On Venus there was no hitch Garcia and Birkerod went to the Liaison Office in Kreingrad as planned and were provided with the Tang Chuh Chih with a load of supplies and with Nick Pappas a former Callistan who wanted to return there They followed the Liaison Office s suggestion and took Pappas aboard We re all Callistans now Birkerod repeated I wonder Nick How did you happen to leave Callisto in the first place Just felt like visiting good old Saskatchewan I doubt it Let s see you left before that business started with the Beldens didn t you Pappas licked his lips nervously Garcia answered for him Yes about ten months before according to what they told us on Venus Yeah Birkerod mused You know the Beldens of course Yes said Pappas of course I came to Earth on their freighter Not their freighter Garcia put in Callisto s freighter which they were operating It s only more recently that it s become their freighter Birkerod smiled and went on It s interesting Mr Pappas that you left Callisto about the time the Beldens plans must have been taking shape I wonder why you did Pappas ignored the question A moment before the red signal light had flashed on above the calculator set in the opposite bulkhead The computations had been finished on Garcia and Birkerod s little conjecture Garcia who was closest to the machine filled in the silence Let s find out what the calculator has to say It may clear things up a little There was a row of spring clamps set in the bulkhead next to him for holding objects stationary while the ship was in free fall Garcia put his gun in one of these slipped out of the safety belt that had held him in the pilot s seat in spite of the lack of gravity and turned to the calculator Pappas sprang Not toward Garcia but toward the side of the cabin that would have been the ceiling if there had been an up He snatched his gun from his jacket Something crashed into Pappas spun him around Birkerod had jumped too hitting him hard in midair The cabin whirled about them He felt Birkerod s powerful grip around the hand which held the gun Simultaneously they reached the ceiling Pappas s head hit metal with a crack The gun fell free Weightless the two of them wrestled desperately Illustration The cabin whirled around them the gun fell free Suddenly Birkerod pulled loose and jumped away Pappas found himself alone in the middle of the cabin drifting slowly from the pilot s seat In the pilot s seat Garcia was again sitting calmly his gun leveled Birkerod had the other gun There was silence while Pappas reached the bulkhead pushed back to his seat and belted himself in Garcia said Suppose I try answering some of these questions When Arne and I left Callisto the Beldens learned our orbit and high tailed in to the inner planets With plenty of fuel they arrived before us and got you their agent on the job You got yourself included in our return trip on the Tang Then you calculated an orbit for us that would run us smack into Earth at a relative velocity of thirty odd kilometers a second The next thing was to divert the fuel from the Tang s tanks to the lifeboat s and take off yourself in the lifeboat That would have left us in a collision orbit with no fuel to pull ourselves out of it Not such a good plan Nick You should have planned just to kill us both as soon as the Tang was in space you d have had a better chance that way Your overeagerness to compute our orbit just didn t look natural No listen Pappas protested feebly I didn t calculate a collision orbit I Sorry said Garcia That s what the machine just finished checking for us The orbit we re on meets Earth dead center and it wouldn t take us to Callisto even if Earth wasn t there Arne what ll we do with this character Birkerod smiled I like the suggestion you made when we discussed it before I was just joking No I think it s the best idea He turned to Pappas who flinched in spite of himself Look Nick the Beldens have no chance of winning on Callisto No chance Men had to learn to cooperate before they could get to the planets at all and by this time they ve learned good and thoroughly The individual who s out for himself is an anachronism You and the Beldens a hundred years ago you d have felt right at home Then everybody was out for a fast buck as they used to say In this century everybody works together and darn near everybody likes it that way But Nick the Beldens are still dangerous They can t win but they can hold up the development of Callisto for years and make the Callistans plenty miserable in the process The inner planets won t interfere Their policy for years has been this Callisto is so far away that it s their concern how they run things we ll send them supplies they ll send us minerals and that s that So the people of Callisto have got to lick the Beldens This ship is absolutely essential because it s the means of breaking the Beldens monopoly We have to get to Callisto and when we get there we ll be in the middle of a pretty critical situation the Tang will be just as essential to the Beldens as to us for the opposite reason Therefore Garcia put in we can t afford to have you around What are you going to do Pappas murmured To you said Birkerod Well we can t take you with us we don t want to kill you if we can help it we can t turn you loose in the lifeboat even if we keep most of the fuel because we may need the lifeboat on Callisto There s one thing left If it s all right with Yusuf we re going to put you altogether completely on your own You re not going to be working for anybody else not even for stinkers like the Beldens You re going to be all by yourself and you re going to have to do a good job of looking out for yourself Not for anyone else just for Nick Pappas Number One as people used to say We re not going to give you a word of advice either If we did you wouldn t be independent enough How does it sound Yusuf Appropriate Garcia smiled Sounds about right Arne Maybe I m too angry at the Beldens to think straight but it sounds like a pretty appropriate way to handle Mr Pappas He ll be all on his own and if he doesn t work things out just right he ll get the most spectacular finish any individualist could ask for Nick Pappas hung weightless in interplanetary space Ten meters away floated the Tang Chuh Chih One side of it glared white in the sunlight the other side was jet black visible only as a shadow across the stars It floated there motionless very close to him but he knew he didn t dare to try to reach it because it was going to start accelerating any second The faceplate of Pappas s spacesuit fogged slightly he moved a hand inside the suit adjusted the humidity control When the faceplate had cleared he saw that the Tang s rockets were already firing The ship still floated there within shouting distance if there had been an atmosphere but now from its jets there extended long perfectly straight streaks of shimmering blue violet It seemed to Pappas as though he was drifting slowly parallel to the ship in the direction of the jets He shook his head to get rid of the illusion He was remaining perfectly still the ship s hull was sliding past him When the jets were abreast of him they cut off He watched the ship receding rapidly now A minute or so later there were two short blasts on the steering jets Pappas realized they were swinging the ship around so he wouldn t be caught in the rocket blast Then the main jets started up again Pappas followed the ship with his eyes as long as he could distinguish it which wasn t long Then he was alone Not only were there no walls around him there wasn t even anything under his feet There was nothing anywhere So this was what all that talk added up to Pappas thought They simply set me out here in the middle of the vacuum to stay until the suit s food and air give out He thought he might as well make himself at home He checked over the suit It was nicely equipped In addition to standard items there were several things strapped onto the back of the suit on the outside which pleased him until he realized how little difference they made There was a reel of light strong cable with magnetic grapples which could be clamped onto it There was a hand reaction motor the size of a Stillson wrench and ten containers of fuel each the size of a fountain pen There was a large mirror for signaling Also for the same purpose there was a powerful highly directional searchlight He checked the cells which powered it they were low but he knew they were charging at that moment from the sunlight falling on them The searchlight would work For what that was worth So much for his suit Next where was he His position couldn t be given in latitude and longitude because there wasn t anything for it to be latitude and longitude on He was somewhere between the orbits of Venus and Earth The direction of the Sun he could tell by glancing at the arm of his spacesuit and seeing where the sunlight fell the Sun was behind him and to the right and a little downward As for the Earth that would be the next brightest body in his sky He craned his head in all directions searching Then he took out the hand reaction motor and gave a blast to start himself spinning so he could search in the directions he hadn t been able to see in before Even the short blast he used made the motor tug at his hand and started the universe whirling around him frighteningly He turned the control on the motor down as low as it would go then pressed the button several more times Finally he had canceled out most of his rotation and the Milky Way was wheeling calmly about him He got himself oriented again and after a short time had identified Earth which was close enough to appear as a blue green disk Earth A thought suddenly struck him The Tang had been heading straight for Earth when it had let him off he was still going exactly in the Tang s former orbit He would reach Earth There was one more thing he should check yes he had a parachute It was on the back of his spacesuit underneath the gear he d investigated before Now if he could land safely he was all set Birkerod and Garcia must not have thought of this One thing still bothered him He had been headed for Earth when he was put off the Tang but had anything happened since to put him off course How about those times he d used the reaction motor to set himself spinning Well the several small blasts would probably not have had any net effect on his direction of motion and if they had there wasn t anything to be done about it But the single strong blast at the beginning he could remember which constellation he d been facing at the time where he d held the reaction motor and how strong a blast he d given That meant he could give an approximately equal blast now in the opposite direction This he did being careful to aim directly away from his center of gravity so as not to start spinning again Now he should be back on course he figured Assuming that is that he d ever been off The small thrust of his reaction motor applied for such a short time might not be enough to make any appreciable difference as to where he ended up He didn t bother trying to calculate it Nothing to do now but wait He spent the time thinking about what he d do when he got to Earth It was hard to figure He d had a racket on Earth for the year and a half after the Beldens brought him there everyone had assumed he was doing something important to Callisto s welfare and all he d had to do was go through the motions Now he didn t know It was probably true that the Beldens were through with the Tang Chuh Chih arriving on Callisto the odds were against them He d have to find something else Pappas decided This whole Belden business was pretty provincial anyway And as for Birkerod Garcia and those people Pappas dismissed Callisto from his thoughts completely There would have to be some angle on the inner planets After several hours of thought on the subject he took stock of his situation again The disk of Earth was a little larger he thought but not enough so you d notice it He pulled the semi opaque visor over his faceplate and went to sleep He slept for ten days Not Earth days however When Pappas went to sleep the Sun was behind him He thought he had eliminated his rotation but actually he was tumbling head over heels extremely slowly Thus for him the Sun rose between his feet and set directly above him The eleventh of these sunrises woke him He stayed awake because as soon as he flipped his visor up and looked around him the Earth caught his eye It was much closer He did not know how to measure its angular diameter so he couldn t calculate his distance from it even approximately but it looked enormous How long had his nap lasted The spacesuit s chronometer was running Its minute hand indicated its hour hand its day hand That would have told him how long he d slept if he d read the chronometer before he went to sleep but he hadn t All he knew was that he d slept much longer than he d expected and long enough to get painfully stiff In any case he d covered a lot of distance As much as the Tang would have covered in the same time he realized He was approaching Earth pretty fast Too fast he added aloud nervously He d have to decelerate before he got there or the parachute wouldn t do him any good Now was it time yet to start decelerating If he directed the hand reaction motor in the wrong direction now could it cause him to miss Earth He guessed not the planet looked so close any small sidewise push he gave himself could hardly hurt Once he killed his speed Earth s gravitational field would gather him in Pappas took out the reaction motor Using low power he turned himself till he faced Earth The planet seemed to have swelled just in the time since he d waked up He set the reaction motor to full power grasped it with both hands held it in front of his chest and pointed it straight at Earth Then he pressed the button and held it down The force of the hand jet pushed in at his midriff made his legs and head swing forward Well that was okay as long as they didn t get into the exhaust He stopped blasting a moment to get a better grip on the reaction motor then fired continuously Occasionally he would find he d started himself spinning then he d shift the motor just a trifle to keep himself facing the planet He kept the button firmly pressed down and the cylinder in his hands sent a continuous jet of intense blue toward Earth When the first fuel cartridge was exhausted he put in the second and kept it up Twice he stopped for a food pellet and a little water The rests were welcome his arms and chest were stiff and aching But he didn t rest long because he was getting really scared now He was sure he was dangerously close to his destination and his speed hadn t been cut enough The continents and oceans of Earth s day side were clearly visible and grew noticeably larger as he looked at them He now thought of the direction he was going as down he thought of himself as falling Something bothered him America had not been in sight a while ago but now he could see a corner of Brazil appearing at the edge of the disk of Earth Did that mean he was passing by Earth instead of falling straight at it No he realized in a moment it just meant Earth was rotating for he could see that the sunset line the line between night side and day side had not changed its apparent position on the disk No he was still falling And he was falling too fast A suspicion began to form that Birkerod and Garcia had anticipated this And suddenly terrifyingly he thought of what Garcia s last remark might have meant Still they d said there was a way he could save himself And the only way he could think of was to break his fall He had a certain quantity of fuel to do it with and he was using it He was using it for all it was worth no matter how much his body ached with fatigue If those two on the Tang had figured this all out ahead of time then they must have left him enough fuel to avoid being killed Otherwise they might as well have shot him on the Tang Okay if he had enough fuel he d use it all One after another the fuel cartridges burned out Pappas longed for another rest but he didn t dare take one now He kept firing and still the Earth kept growing larger and brighter below him Finally there was no more fuel After a short breather Pappas took the reaction motor detached it from the cord which bound it to his spacesuit and flung it downward with all his strength Then he did the same with the mirror the searchlight and the reel of cable It was all he could do Then there was an instant when he saw where he had gone wrong He had not had enough fuel to do what he d tried to do That was clear by one look at Earth s face which still grew alarmingly fast below him and he could probably have figured it out before But there had been a way which would have given him some chance He should have used his fuel not in a hopeless attempt to decelerate but in deflecting himself so he would miss Earth He would have passed by Earth relatively close He d have passed fast but not too fast to signal with his mirror to Earth s several satellites natural and artificial The spaceports on those satellites kept twenty four hour watches for signals of distress when they saw a faint blinking light they would send out a ship which would try to locate its source They were good at it too and if he d kept his mirror spinning they might have picked him up But he hadn t thought of it It had never occurred to him that even when he was alone as thoroughly alone as anyone can ever be his life could depend on dozens of other people He d thought only of reaching safety by himself And seeing only the one possibility he d played it blindly There was that instant of sickening realization then a little later came an instant when Earth ballooned out grotesquely below him suddenly filling most of his field of vision and he saw lakes islands deserts He felt all over him an abrupt final flash of heat and Nick Pappas became a meteor END

LITERATURE ON THE PLATINUM GROUP NOTE Numerals in square brackets in the text refer to the Bibliography at the end THE PLATINUM METALS CHAPTER I PLATINUM METALS THEIR OCCURRENCES CHARACTERS AND USES INTRODUCTION The metals which comprise the Platinum group are the following Platinum Palladium Iridium Osmium Ruthenium and Rhodium Up to the year Russia produced over per cent of the world s supply of platinum the Republic of Colombia South America ranking next in importance with about per cent Owing however to the war and to the chaotic conditions brought about by the revolution the output of Russia has considerably decreased and although the Colombian production has been steadily increasing the increased demand in connection with munition manufacture caused a somewhat serious shortage during the latter stages of the war which was especially felt in the United States As a result much exploratory work has recently been carried on in an endeavour to discover new deposits of importance but up to the present although several fresh occurrences have been brought to light results have on the whole been disappointing OCCURRENCES Platinum usually occurs in nature as native metal alloyed with one or more of its allied metals in the form of very fine grains more or less flattened sometimes in the form of irregular nuggets and occasionally though rarely in small cubic crystals It is sometimes coated with a black layer of iron oxide which may be magnetic in which case it is not easily recognizable When unrefined it is referred to as crude platinum With the exception of a certain amount of the platinum metals obtained from the refining of copper and gold bullion particularly from the copper nickel deposits of Sudbury Ontario about per cent of the whole supply is derived from alluvial deposits Several occurrences of platinum in situ are known but so far few are of commercial importance however in view of the indications of exhaustion shown by some of the placer deposits notably in Russia the exploration of primary ores is now receiving more attention and practical results have already been achieved in Russia and in Spain The mother rocks from which the deposits are derived in the large majority of known cases consist of basic and ultra basic igneous rocks including peridotites pyroxenites and dunites The two first are composed of iron magnesian silicates pyroxene augite and hornblende with olivine chromite ilmenite and magnetite the dunites consist principally of olivine with some chromite These rocks are often found to have undergone more or less alteration to serpentine In addition platinum has been found in quartz veins notably at the Boss Mine Nevada and in a few known cases it has been derived from formations in schistose or altered sedimentary rocks When present in serpentine platinum is usually disseminated through the rock in fine particles It seldom occurs in a lode formation In sedimentary rocks it usually occurs in sandstones In cases where alluvial deposits have been derived from the basic igneous rocks the associated minerals are usually chromite magnetite ilmenite iridium and osmiridium In sedimentary deposits the metal is commonly associated with quartz copper nickel silver and palladium Platinum has been found in certain varieties of the copper ores tetrahedrite and bournonite It has occasionally been located in shales and in coal although not in recoverable quantities In the latter case in an Australian coal it is associated with vanadium p Several cases are known of platinum being present in meteorites two well authenticated instances having been reported from Mexico Platinum has been shown to exist in meteoric iron from New South Wales Crude platinum as recovered contains from to per cent of the metal and as mentioned above is really an alloy of platinum with one or more of the allied metals the chief impurities consisting principally of iron and copper The table on the next page gives the analyses of typical samples of crude platinum from the Urals California British Columbia and other places Platinum also occurs in combination with arsenic in the mineral Sperrylite PtAs in the form of minute octahedral crystals The colour of this mineral is tin white its lustre is metallic and brilliant its hardness varies from to and its specific gravity is The mineral is brittle and breaks with a conchoidal fracture It is very rare and is interesting as being the only mineral of platinum known besides the native metal It occurs associated with sulphide minerals of magmatic origin in gabbros and diabases notably in the nickeliferous pyrites of Sudbury Canada and in the copper ores of the Rambler Mine Laramie Wyoming It is probable that the palladium which is also found in these deposits is similarly present in the form of an arsenide but such a mineral has not yet been definitely proved to exist The following is an analysis of a sample of sperrylite platinum per cent rhodium per cent palladium trace arsenic per cent antimony per cent p PROPERTIES OF THE PLATINUM METALS Platinum The colour is white with a greyish tinge When pure it is very malleable and ductile Its coefficient of expansion is less than that of all other metals Platinum fuses at about C but the presence of impurities lowers the melting point Its specific gravity is and its hardness is from to Its electric conductivity is low being at C p Composition of Native Platinum and Osmiridium Locality Pt Fe Pd Rh Ir Os Cu Os Ir Remarks Platinum Per Per Per Per Per Per Per Per cent cent cent cent cent

Native Iridium Urals Reference Pt platinum Fe iron Pd palladium Rh rhodium Ir iridium Os osmium Cu copper Os Ir osmiridium Ru ruthenium Footnote B Average percentage of Urals platinum is a little under p Platinum is not acted upon by either nitric sulphuric or hydrochloric acid but is soluble in aqua regia part of nitric to parts of hydrochloric acid or in other mixtures liberating chlorine with the formation of platinum tetrachloride PtCl It is not acted upon by air or moisture even at high temperatures It is corroded by caustic alkalis sulphides sulphates phosphates and arsenides if heated in contact with them It will not amalgamate with mercury unless sodium is present in this respect differing from gold and silver Platinum in a finely divided condition absorbs large quantities of hydrogen or other gases which on occlusion become more active hence its value as a catalytic agent Palladium This metal resembles platinum but is sometimes fibrous the colour being between that of platinum and of silver It possesses a lower melting point than platinum about C It is malleable has a hardness of from to and a specific gravity of As already stated palladium when found in copper ores is probably present in combination with arsenic Porpezite a rare mineral containing gold and up to per cent palladium has been identified in gold bearing veins in Brazil see p Palladium is produced from the refining of copper matte and of base gold bullion from Australia and elsewhere Iridium is a brilliant white brittle metal with a specific gravity of and hardness of to Its fusion point is very high about C and under ordinary conditions it is not attacked by any acid At C it begins to oxidize to a purple oxide Iridium usually occurs either in crude platinum or alloyed with osmium as iridosmine or as native metal The bulk of iridium is derived from the platinum placer deposits of the Urals but the Californian metal is more valuable on account of its better quality It is also obtained in small amounts from copper bullion Osmium is a hard and brittle metal bluish grey in colour Its specific gravity is and it has a very high melting point in this respect being the most refractory of the group Iridosmine or Osmiridium an alloy of iridium and osmium occurs as hexagonal crystals or flattened grains of lighter colour than platinum It may contain from to per cent of iridium and from to per cent of osmium If the iridium predominates the alloy is called Nevyanskite and Siserskite if the osmium content is high It is distinguishable from platinum by the brittleness of the flakes Siserskite gives off a pungent odour if strongly heated caused by the volatilization of osmium Iridosmine has a hardness of to and a specific gravity of to Ruthenium is a white metal with a specific gravity of It is scarcely acted upon by aqua regia Ruthenium occurs mainly in small amounts in iridosmine It is also found in the copper ores of Sudbury and other places Laurite is a very rare sulphide of ruthenium RuS containing a small amount of osmium which has only been recognized in the Borneo deposits Rhodium is a white metal resembling aluminium with a specific gravity of and a melting point of about C It is ductile and malleable at red heat In addition to its occurrence in crude platinum the metal is also contained in small quantities in the sperrylite found in the copper ores of Sudbury Canada p Colloidal Platinum This has only recently been detected in ores and therefore its occurrence might not be detected qualitatively By destroying its colloidal condition however its presence can be discovered in the ordinary ways METALLURGICAL TREATMENT Crude platinum can be refined either by dry or by wet methods the following being brief outlines of the two processes By the wet method the crude platinum is dissolved in aqua regia with excess of hydrochloric acid Evaporation is continued until the whole of the nitric acid is expelled By addition of a solution of ammonium chloride the platinum is then precipitated as ammonium platini chloride This precipitate is heated to redness when chlorine and ammonium chloride are given off and spongy platinum remains The last is next granulated after fusion by the oxy hydrogen blowpipe in a small lime furnace Platinum obtained by this method may contain small amounts of iridium rhodium and palladium In the dry method introduced by Delville and Debray the crude platinum is smelted with galena in a small reverberatory furnace A portion of the lead is reduced to the metallic state by the iron in the charge and forms a fusible alloy with the platinum The osmiridium present settles to the bottom of the furnace and may thus be removed Litharge is then thrown in to form more alloy and some glass to act as a flux The alloy is cupelled and the residual platinum is then melted in a lime furnace with the oxy hydrogen flame The platinum thus obtained often contains iridium and rhodium A combination of these two methods is also sometimes employed p The electrolytic process of gold refining was introduced to treat platiniferous gold In the gold chloride or Wohlwill method iridium and osmiridium are insoluble and remain with the anode slime Platinum and palladium if nearly pure are also insoluble but when present alloyed with gold and silver pass into the solution and remain there In a hot bath it is stated that the platinum present should not exceed gm per litre According to T K Rose a cold bath containing only gm per litre causes a certain quantity of platinum to be deposited with the gold H F Keller in Platinum the Most Precious of Metals Journal of the Franklin Institute November deals fully with the extraction and refining of platinum PLATINUM REFINING AGENCIES The following contains

and others handling scrap According to Russian information about per cent of the Russian output before the war was refined in Germany In Russia there are practically no platinum refining facilities THE USES OF PLATINUM AND ITS ALLIES Platinum In the chemical industry platinum is largely used for catalyzers in the manufacture of sulphuric acetic and nitric acids for stills for the final concentration of sulphuric acid and in the electro chemical industry In the making of contact sulphuric acid a contact mass is charged into the chambers of the plant This is formed by soaking asbestos or anhydrous magnesium sulphate with platinic chloride solution and baking the mass to drive off the chlorine The contact mass usually contains from to per cent platinum in a very finely divided state In the making of acetic acid from a mixture of air and alcohol vapour platinized asbestos is used For the catalyzer used in the conversion of ammonia into nitric acid a very fine meshed platinum gauze is used this is strengthened at its edges with platinum iridium wire One ounce of platinum is required for the production per annum of tons of catalytic acid or of tons of nitric acid from ammonia In the finely divided state all the other metals of the platinum group especially palladium have also the facility of absorbing great quantities of certain gases and can be used as catalysts Owing to its high melting point and to the resistance to the action of acids at high temperatures platinum is largely used for chemical ware in the form of crucibles dishes etc Platinum crucibles are indispensable in the chemical analysis of rocks In the electrical industry platinum is largely used for contact points in telegraph and telephone apparatus in magneto contacts and in the construction of the thermo couples of pyrometers In the manufacture of jewellery especially in the crown setting of diamonds platinum has been much used in the place of gold alloyed with a little iridium it can be worked into delicate designs which are durable During the war however when platinum was largely wanted in the making of munitions its use in jewellery manufacture was much restricted Platinum was formerly largely used in dentistry In photography potassium platino chloride is required for producing platinotype prints In the form of barium platino cyanide it is used in X ray photography as a coating for the projecting screen Platinum is required in the manufacture of certain parts of chronometers theodolites and watches also for standard weights and measures and for various types of self lighting lamps p Palladium has its chief value as a substitute for platinum in palladium gold alloys which are used extensively in dentistry for jewellery and for chemical ware It is also utilized in the manufacture of astronomical instruments and watches also for plating metal ware p The use of palladium as a catalyzer is well known Iridium when pure is of small value being difficult to manipulate on account of its brittleness It is principally used in alloy with platinum for hardening purposes Jewellers platinum usually contains per cent iridium and in the electrical industry an alloy composed of from to per cent iridium is usually employed Alloys with up to per cent of iridium are ductile and malleable but with over that amount are hard and difficult to work The metal is used in the manufacture of fountain pen points for which purpose the grains require careful selecting p also for standard weights and for contact points Iridium black an oxide is of value as a pigment for chinaware p Iridium is suitable for sharp surgical instruments and gold needles with soldered iridium ends are employed for stitching wounds It is also used in photography Iridium is of greater scarcity than platinum hence its greater value Osmium There is now little or no market for osmium It was formerly in considerable use for the manufacture of incandescent lamps Osmic acid is used for staining anatomical preparations in microscopic work On account of the poisonous nature of its vapour the extraction of osmium is costly and dangerous Ruthenium is also of little or no commercial value Both these metals possess the disadvantages of being brittle and easily oxidized Rhodium is of small commercial use It is used principally in alloy with platinum An alloy containing per cent rhodium is used for some thermo couples of pyrometers and in the making of laboratory utensils Platinum Alloys Platinum forms alloys with a number of metals but only a few are of industrial importance p Platinum and iridium

alloy Palladium alloy ALLOY SUBSTITUTES FOR PLATINUM On account of the scarcity and high price of the platinum metals much attention has lately been directed towards the discovery of suitable substitutes In the electrical industry an alloy of parts of palladium and parts of silver is in use also an alloy of nickel and chromium Platinite an iron nickel alloy containing per cent nickel and per cent carbon has the same coefficient of expansion as glass and when coated with copper is used to replace the platinum connection wires of incandescent lamps Tungsten is sometimes used for certain ignition devices For cathodes an alloy of per cent gold and per cent copper can be used to replace platinum the same alloy if electrically coated with platinum and then carefully polished and burnished is suitable for platinum anodes For platinum chemical laboratory ware there are several substitutes such as fused quartz various iron chromium and nickel chromium alloys palau a gold iridium alloy marketed in California rhotanum a general name for gold palladium alloys containing from to per cent of gold which are suitable for most chemical purposes except for use with hot concentrated nitric acid and for electrolytic anodes amaloy which is a complex alloy containing nickel chromium tungsten etc highly resistant to corrosion and to cold nitric and sulphuric acids p In the jewellery trade platinum has been replaced by an alloy of per cent palladium and per cent rhodium For certain surgical work various stellite alloys containing cobalt and chromium and hardened by the addition of tungsten and molybdenum are valuable substitutes for platinum and are not affected by antiseptic solutions In dental work pins are now made of tungsten coated with palladium p For most technical purposes an alloy of tungsten and nickel with gold or silver is used in Germany it may be cast rolled or forged is acid resisting and capable of taking a high polish White gold another substitute for platinum contains fine gold from to per cent pure nickel from to per cent and zinc from to per cent Illium a chromium nickel copper alloy reported recently as the discovery of S W Parr of Illinois is a substitute for gold or platinum costing only cents per ounce It is stated to have been a per cent standard of success The alloy withstands hot or cold strong or diluted acid can be both cast and machined and is already used largely in the manufacture of calorimeter bombs The results of researches made to discover substitutes for platinum and undertaken by the National Dental Association of America are described at length by F A Fahrenwald in a paper read in January before the American Institute of Mining Engineers SCRAP PLATINUM A considerable amount of platinum in the form of old and worn articles is now collected for return to the refineries where it is re treated and sold again as new metal The trade in scrap platinum has been particularly active in the United States official statistics showing that in oz of refined platinum were recovered WORLD S OUTPUT OF PLATINUM According to J L Howe the estimated limits of the total world production of crude platinum up to January

June which he distributes according to the uses made of it as follows Oz Chemical and physical apparatus Electrical devices Catalyzing Dental uses Jewellery Minor uses and hoarded balance It is difficult to obtain exact figures of the annual production of crude platinum This is particularly so in the case of Russia where there appears to have been a tendency for private enterprises to keep their published outputs as low as possible in order to avoid registration The discrepancy between the official and actual figures of production in Russia is variously estimated at from to per cent The

AND ALLIED METALS a BRITISH EMPIRE The outputs of platinum metals in different parts of the British Empire are shown in the table on p EUROPE UNITED KINGDOM There is no known occurrence of platinum in the United Kingdom but there has always been much trade done there in the platinum metals England having been the second largest importer of the big consuming nations The following were the importations of Russian platinum for five periods since Period Oz p The above figures do not include receipts of platinum for seven different years since for which there are no records The table on the next page gives a summary of total imports of platinum metals for the years with the countries of origin The platinum market in London was controlled by the Government from January to December Johnson Matthey Co Ltd acting as buyers On December platinum was declared contraband Imports of Platinum Metals wrought and unwrought into United Kingdom in troy oz From British countries From foreign countries Russia Germany France United States Colombia Other foreign countries Total foreign countries Grand total oz From British countries From foreign countries Russia Germany France United States Colombia Other foreign countries Total foreign countries Grand total oz About per cent of the Russian and one half of the Colombian outputs were sold to England during the war as well as most of the Australian and Indian production Much of this metal was refined in the United States According to J E Orchard the commercial control financial of the world s output of platinum of oz of was divided as follows France per cent Russia per cent United States per cent British Empire per cent other countries per cent whilst the political control territorial was divided as follows Russia per cent Colombia per cent other countries per cent ASIA INDIA Traces of platinum and iridium have been noticed in association with the gold obtained from native workings at Bonai City The gold occurs in a deposit of iron oxide which forms the cementing material in a hard stratum of quartz pebbles The oxide is separated by pounding and then washed away to extract the gold The proportion of platinum to gold is probably less than to Platinum occurs associated with gold in the gravels of the Irawaddy River in Burma A small quantity of platinum is obtained at Myitkyina by the Burma Gold Dredging Company During the years oz were won by this company In the output was oz and in oz In oz only were produced Owing to the cessation of the golddredging operations at Myitkyina Burma has ceased to produce platinum the quantity recovered during the year being only oz It has also been located with iridosmine in the auriferous gravels of the rivers draining the slopes of the Patkoi Ranges both on the Assam and Burma sides AFRICA RHODESIA Platinum has recently been located in the Gwelo district about miles north east of Indiva siding where it occurs in the great dyke of norite which is here about miles wide A E V Zealley the late assistant Government geologist made this occurrence the subject of a special report The country rock is a serpentinized dunite The deposit is capped by a ferruginous siliceous gossan from to ft wide which may be traced on the surface for about ft and is comparable to a fissure vein The gossan consists largely of h matite and chalcedony with occasional veinlets of copper and nickel minerals Although the presence of platinum in the ore could not be detected by panning the possibility of its occurrence on geological grounds was considered and a sample of concentrate from an unstated amount of ore was forwarded to the Imperial Institute for analysis The sample was found to contain platinum to the amount of dwt gr per ton A report on the further development of this deposit is awaited with interest A sample of concentrate from an unstated amount of material from the gem bearing gravels of Somabula Forest Gwelo district was received at the Imperial Institute from the Director of the Geological Survey of Southern Rhodesia in November On analysis this sample yielded the following per ton platinum oz dwt osmiridium oz The concentrate also contained a large proportion of gold As shown by the latest information available the deposits although undoubtedly rich appear to extend over a limited area According to an analysis made at the Imperial Institute a sample of chromite from Southern Rhodesia Selukwe contained per cent copper and nickel oxides and a trace of platinum H B Maufe has stated that as the River Umtebekwe drains two areas of ultra basic rock containing chromite it might be expected to contain alluvial platinum as well as gold and as a matter of fact platinum has actually been discovered in a reef in the Great Dyke norite at the head of the Umtebekwe valley The presence of platinum was recently reported at Willoughby s Halt miles south of Gwelo UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA Cape Colony Platinum is present in varying quantities in the copper nickel deposits at Insizwa situated in the Cape Province close to the boundary between East Griqualand and Pondoland The rock formation consists of a basin shaped mass of intrusive norite averaging from to ft in thickness and lying in the shales and sandstones of the Beaufort Series of the Karroo System The ore body consists of sulphides of copper and nickel in association with pyrrhotite the minerals occurring disseminated near the basal margin of the intrusive in olivine picrite Gold and silver are also present in small quantities The average copper and nickel contents in the ore are each about per cent and the platinum content averages from to dwt per ton the platinum being unequally distributed through the ore p It is not certain in what form the platinum occurs It does not appear to be present as sperrylite In the opinion of W H Goodchild it may occur in close association with the silver p Mining operations have been intermittently carried on here during the last fifty years the last exploratory work coming to an end in Operations were however resumed early in Transvaal Small amounts of platinum and its allied metals have from time to time been noticed in black sands from the battery clean ups on the Rand at Klerksdorp and other gold mining districts and platinum to the amount of dwt per ton is reported to have been present in residual slimes at the Rietfontein mines A specimen consisting of about per cent osmiridium and per cent platinum recently received at the Imperial Institute was stated to have been taken from a compact shale immediately underlying the banket reef in one of the mines of the Klerksdorp district In the large majority of the gold mines however the platinum metals if present appear to exist in such small quantities as to escape detection A series of samples of chromite from Kromdaal near Rustenburg showed from a mere trace to dwt of platinum per ton and one sample of chromite from the Secocoeniland deposits showed as much as dwt of platinum per ton NORTH AMERICA CANADA The occurrence of platinum in Canada was first observed in in the course of gold mining operations on the Rivi re du Loup and the Rivi re des Plantes in the province of Quebec p Since that time platinum has been found in a number of localities associated with auriferous gravels but the crude metal has only been obtained commercially from the Similkameen district in British Columbia These deposits first attracted attention in All the workings are alluvial although the platinum has in several cases been traced to its parent source Alberta Platinum and gold in minute grains closely intermixed are found in the North Saskatchewan River near Edmonton In certain platinum occurrences were examined by the Munitions Resources Commission visits being paid to Fort Saskatchewan and the Peace River district in Alberta These deposits however proved to be disappointing In the former locality which was carefully tested by drilling the values of the samples obtained averaged less than cents in gold and platinum per c yd of gravel p British Columbia Platinum associated with gold which is the dominant metal occurs in the Tulameen River and its tributaries the principal of which is Slate Creek others being Cedar Eagle Bear and Granite Creeks The metal is present in small rounded grains or pellets Chromite is often found intergrown with the platinum olivine and pyroxene usually occurring in association The heavy minerals remaining with platinum in the concentrate are titaniferous magnetite chromite and native copper The platinum is sometimes magnetic probably due to the covering of the grains by small particles of magnetite The following analysis according to G C Hoffmann is representative of an average sample of crude platinum from the Tulameen River Per cent Platinum Palladium Rhodium Iridium Osmiridium Copper Iron Gangue Chromite Owing to the presence of osmiridium in considerable proportion the ore is classed as hard metal and on that account fetches a higher price Many of the richer placers have become exhausted and work is now carried on by a few individuals principally Chinese who work during the summer months only In some cases high benches to ft above the creek bottom are being worked Much of the platinum and gold is of a coarse texture with a rough surface and the latter is sometimes found embedded in quartz Nuggets are sometimes found encrusted with chromite and are thus liable to be overlooked The deposits are therefore not of great age and the metals have not been transported long distances from their sources Kemp is of opinion that the platinum is derived from pyroxenite dykes cutting through peridotites which outcrop on Olivine and Grasshopper Mountains It is of interest to note that some diamonds and rubies have been discovered with the platinum in the Tulameen deposits They are of good quality but of small size and occur in a matrix of dunite p American capital dominates the platinum industry in the district In at the request of the Imperial Munitions Board special investigations in this area were undertaken by members of the Geological Survey and several prospecting bores were put down to bedrock Full reports of the work done are not yet available but it is understood that the results are considered to be promising and to warrant further examination of the district p Platinum was in discovered at Franklin Camp near Grand Forks B C in the Black Lead so called which is a mixture of augite per cent orthoclase and microcline per cent hornblende per cent and magnetite per cent as determined by microscopic measurements on a typical specimen with accessory minerals chalcopyrite bornite and apatite A sample of chalcopyrite assayed oz crude platinum per ton Samples of the Black Lead assayed from to oz per ton At Burnt Basin on the Mother Lode claim an auriferous quartz vein carries platinum in amounts varying from a trace to oz per ton The quartz also contains chalcopyrite pyrite galena sphalerite and molybdenite Native platinum in small quantities has been found associated with gold in the following localities Tranquille River Fraser River Rock Creek Yale District North Thompson and Clearwater Rivers It has also been reported to occur in a dyke across the Kootenay River upon the Granite Poorman Mining Company s property a few miles from Nelson At Siwash Creek in the Tulameen district small flakes of platinum associated with chromite often occur in shear zones in granite Dredging for gold and platinum is being carried on on the Peace River North British Columbia According to J B Hobson the heavy concentrate produced on the Consolidated Caribo hydraulic mine at Quesnel contains besides gold and silver platinum palladium and osmiridium one analysis giving a total value of per ton The gold and silver being non amalgamable are probably included in particles of pyrite and galena whilst the platinum metals are found as minute grains or are enclosed in particles of chromite and magnetite A system of under currents is being installed to properly dress this concentrate In the recorded output of crude platinum from the placer gravels of the Tulameen district in British Columbia was oz that for being oz For the five years preceding this district produced on an average over oz per year Manitoba Samples of gold ore containing platinum have been obtained in the Star Lake district of south eastern Manitoba Analyses of the samples from different auriferous reefs were made by the Department of Mines in and yielded platinum varying in amount from a trace to oz per ton In addition to gold and platinum the veins carry small quantities of galena zinc blende pyrite chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite in a gangue consisting mainly of quartz Platinum is reported to occur in auriferous quartz veins in several mines and prospects in Le Pas district a picked sample of ore from the mine of the Northern Manitoba and Development Company assayed gold and platinum per ton McCafferty s Prospect about miles away contains platiniferous quartz Nova Scotia According to E R Faribault in Summary Report Part F of the Canadian Department of Mines platinum has been found mostly in traces in some of the old gold districts of Halifax county and lately in the tungsten concentrates of the Moose River mines So far all occurrences are in quartz veins in the lower quartzite and slate formation of the gold bearing series of the Atlantic coast The platiniferous mineral is supposed to be sperrylite with which is associated arsenopyrite Ontario Sudbury is one of the few places where platinum is profitably extracted from deposits in situ The metal which was first discovered in this region in is found mostly in combination with arsenic as sperrylite associated mainly with chalcopyrite in the well known copper and nickel bearing deposits of the district The origin of the ore bodies has not yet been settled They are either marginal deposits in or off shoot deposits to a norite laceolith which has intruded sedimentary rocks the ores consisting principally of chalcopyrite pyrrhotite and pentlandite Metallic platinum gold silver and palladium occur in the ore the last also probably as an arsenide The highest platinum content is associated with the highest copper content the highest palladium with the highest nickel According to Roberts and Longyear the mean analysis of rocks of from sixteen drill holes gave an average ore content of copper per cent nickel per cent silver oz gold oz and metallic platinum oz per ton The ore is principally worked for its nickel and copper content and yields a large proportion of the world s supply of nickel The ore is first smelted at the mines and a portion of the low grade matte so produced is then shipped to South Wales for final treatment the remainder being sent to the recently constructed refinery of the International Nickel Co at Port Colborne Ontario and to the United States It was stated in that this matte contained on the average oz of the platinum metals per ton of nickel content of the matte of which about per cent was extracted p The Victoria Mine owned by the Mond Nickel Co is stated to carry a high percentage of the precious metals as is also the Vermilion Mine although in the latter case the ore body is very small In the total output of copper nickel ore from these deposits amounted to tons of which the Canadian Copper Co raised tons the Mond Nickel Co tons and the Alexo Mining Co tons The nickel content of the ore of the Canadian Copper Co was about times that of the copper whilst the ore mined by the other two companies contained the two metals in approximately equal proportions The matte produced by the Alexo Mining Co is smelted by the Mond Nickel Co According to the report of the Royal Ontario Nickel Commission the matte produced by the Canadian Copper Co in was estimated to contain oz platinum and oz palladium corresponding to oz platinum and oz palladium per ton of matte the International Nickel Co recovering in that year oz platinum and oz allied metals This company is now reported to have improved its methods of recovery In the total matte shipment by the Canadian Copper Co is stated to have contained among other precious metals oz platinum and oz palladium According to information supplied by the Mond Nickel Co their nickel residues derived from the refining of the matte are taken over by Johnson Matthey Co Ltd During the years the residues disposed of were estimated to contain the following amounts of platinum metals In oz troy Platinum Palladium Iridium and Rhodium Messrs Johnson Matthey Co Ltd have kindly supplied the following figures of platinum extraction from these residues Oz troy The British America Nickel Corporation who are developing some large deposits in the same district are also erecting a refinery near Hull on the Ottawa River It is stated that they will employ the Hybinette process of electrolytic refining and expect to obtain a high recovery of the precious metals p With gradual improvements in the refining process and with the refining of the whole of the matte produced instead of a portion only as at present it seems probable that the production of platinum metals by the three nickel companies may in time exceed oz per annum The report of the Ontario Bureau of Mines shows that in the International Nickel Co treated tons of matte for fine oz of platinum oz of palladium and oz of metals of the rhodium group This cannot be used as a basis of calculation as the proportions are not constant On the Quinn claims near the Cr sus Mine Munro Township is auriferous quartz containing platinum Five assays gave a platinum content of value ranging from to per ton with platinum at from to per oz The Abro Mine in the Timiskaming district in shipped between and tons of ore containing oz of palladium and platinum per ton The ore consists of pyrrhotite chalcopyrite and pentlandite in a gangue of altered peridotite and serpentine Yukon Territory Platinum occurs associated with gold in small quantities in most of the tributaries of the Yukon River notably at the mouth of the Hootalinqua River and in the River Lewis p NEWFOUNDLAND Chromite derived from the serpentinized area in the region of Mount Cormack situated in the central part of the island has been found to contain small quantities of platinum AUSTRALASIA AUSTRALIA The most important occurrences of platinum in the Commonwealth are at Fifield and at Platina in New South Wales The outputs of crude platinum in Australia in recent years were all exported to the United Kingdom as under Year Troy oz Note These figures do not include the osmiridium produced in Tasmania Recent imports of manufactured platinum were as under Oz The question of the refining of platinum in Australia has been under consideration for some time so far the crude material has all been sent to England The outlook for future production of crude platinum in Australia is not promising with the exception of that of Bald Hill district Tasmania New South Wales Platinum is obtained at Platina in the Fifield division in the east central part of the State from a buried gravel channel in which it occurs in association with gold and osmiridium The rocks in the vicinity of the leads consist chiefly of slates but the source of the platinum is not known p These deposits were first exploited in and from that year to inclusive the total output of platinum from New South Wales was oz The gravels have yielded amounts of dwt platinum and dwt gold per ton but according to Government reports the richer deposits are nearly worked out mining operations are carried on with great difficulty as there is a great scarcity of water and a deep overburden varying from to ft in depth It is estimated that there are acres of platinum country available sufficiently rich to pay were it worked on a large scale with an abundant supply of water A new occurrence has recently been discovered about mile distant from the old Platina deep lead the platinum being associated with small quantities of gold The lead has so far been proved to extend over an area about mile in length and from to ft in width the wash varying in depth from a few feet to up to about ft The pay gravels which rest on shales and sandstones of Silurian and Devonian age intruded by dioritic dykes are stated to be from to ft thick The following analysis is representative of the crude platinum produced Per cent Platinum Iridium Rhodium Palladium trace Osmiridium Iron Silica p Platinum is frequently found in beach sand deposits on the coastal border between Queensland and New South Wales notably at Ballina close to the mouth of the Richmond River at Evans Head further south and at Currumbin near the mouth of the Tweed River In this locality black sands containing platinum associated with gold cassiterite monazite and osmiridium accumulate on the beaches during stormy weather At Ballina and Evans Head the platinum predominates over the gold but at Currumbin further south the gold is in the greater quantity p The minerals are present in a very finely divided state and separation of the valuable metals is a matter of considerable difficulty The problem does not appear to have been satisfactorily solved up to the present time although promising experiments have recently been carried out with screening and magnetic treatment The deposits are unfortunately very low grade The sources of the metals are uncertain The platinum and osmiridium appear to have been derived from the western edge of the Clarence coal measures which now exist only as fragmentary outcrops The gold tin and monazite may have their origin in granite and other rocks of the New England tableland Chromite is present in some of the Currumbin sands which suggests serpentine as the probable source of platinum p Other associations are zircon garnet tourmaline ilmenite magnetite and sapphire In the Broken Hill district principally at Little Darling and Mulga Springs Creek platinum has been proved to extend over a considerable area in a copper nickel gossan closely associated with gabbro decomposed gneisses and schists In addition to platinum the amounts of which vary from a trace to dwt per ton gold silver iridium and palladium are also present The deposits bear some resemblance to the nickel deposits of Sudbury Ontario and it is thought that here too the platinum occurs combined with arsenic as sperrylite Queensland In addition to the beach deposits between Southport and Currumbin described above platinum has been found in Coopooroo and Wairamba Creeks on the Russell Goldfield near Innisfail also in the Lucknow and Alma reefs of the Gympie Goldfield where it is present in quartz lodes with native gold and arsenopyrite the accompanying rocks consisting of slates alternating with volcanic tuffs and conglomerates the metal also exists in the neighbouring gold bearing alluvial deposits of Brickfield Gully Another occurrence of alluvial platinum is known at the head of the Don River in Central Queensland p Victoria Platinum occurs in the Walhalla Copper Mine where it is associated in a hornblende diorite lode formation with copper pyrites gold and silver The ore is stated to contain from to dwt platinum per ton In the Thompson River Copper Mine platinum is found in a hornblendic rock rich in chalcopyrite Tasmania Iridosmine has been produced from the Bald Hill district near Waratah in the north western part of the state since the metal being obtained from placer deposits in Nineteen Mile Creek and its tributaries Linger and Die McGinty s and Barren Creeks and from Savage River It has been located in situ in the rocks of Bald Hill principally in serpentine but also with chalcedony and opaline silica in lode formations In the former case it is associated with magnetite pyrite pyrrhotite nickel and gold The iridosmine in the placer deposits is sometimes coated with iron oxide and is also at times found enclosed in chromite The following analysis in percentages made at the Imperial Institute is typical osmium iridium platinum ruthenium palladium gold iron copper trace Other localities in Tasmania at which osmiridium has been located are Heazlewood River Whyte River Castray River Huskisson River Wilson River and Boyes River also the Badger gold diggings west of Savage River and the Salisbury goldfield near Beaconsfield The following table gives the recent annual output of osmiridium in Tasmania Year oz Value troy in South Australia In the north east part of the State traces of platinum have been recognized by analysis as occurring in the outcrop of a lode near Boolcoomatta Further information on this occurrence is not available Papua Osmiridium associated with small amounts of gold only is known to occur as alluvial in the neighbourhoods of various serpentine areas in the Lakekamu district in flaky form in the Yodda Valley in appearance similar to native bismuth and in other places in shot like granules NEW ZEALAND Platinum is only obtained commercially in New Zealand from the Orepuki district of Southland where it is produced by the Round Hill Gold Mining Company as a by product in the washing of auriferous gravels According to information recently supplied by the Mines Department the annual output of crude platinum for the last ten years has averaged oz but in view of the recent falling off of the gold production in this locality the prospects of any increase in the output of platinum seem small In South Island the presence of platinum has been reported on the Thames River in quartz lodes in a region of serpentine and diorite and in a pyritic lode near the Taramakau River in the district of Westland in close proximity to sheets of altered magnesian eruptive rocks p The platinum in the latter case occurs in association with silver in the proportions of about parts of the latter to of the former together with pyrite and limonite Samples taken from the lode have been stated to have an average content of dwt gr platinum per ton Other localities in South Island where platinum has been located are the Taraka and George Rivers which flow into Awarua Bay the east coast of Otago in beach sands and river gravels the Clutha River and the Nelson gold district Concentrates containing up to per oz per ton are reported to have been obtained from the Parapara sub division Platinum in New Zealand is often associated with gold and the deposits are in many cases similar to those of the Urals CHAPTER III SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF PLATINUM METALS b FOREIGN COUNTRIES EUROPE FRANCE Platinum metals are not produced in France but platinum is known to occur at several places In the Department of Charaste and Deux Sevres it occurs associated with pyrite and limonite in the Valle du Drae Hautes Alpes above Chatalard platinum occurs in tetrahedrite in metamorphic limestone at St Arey near La Mure Isere it occurs in bournonite in dolomite and altered limestone Platinum is found in argentiferous tetrahedrite and malachite near Presles in Savoy As mentioned below under Russia p France controlled the production of platinum in Russia before the war through the Compagnie Internationale du Platine due to its extensive ownership of platinum deposits and its contracts with Russian companies The accompanying table gives a summary of recent imports with countries of origin as far as can be obtained Imports Recent imports in kilograms troy oz into France of crude manufactured and scrap platinum were as under From United Russia Germany Serbia Switzerland Year Kingdom No details available From Austria Hungary Other Total Year countries No details available GERMANY Platinum has recently been discovered in Westphalia deposits having been found in Freudenberg Siegen Meschede in Siegerland Sauerland and Westerwald It occurs in a series of fragmental deposits including principally slates and graywackes the latter composed of quartz and slate with an argillaceous cement it is also occasionally found in the recemented fragments which are presumably derived from the basal granite formation underlying the platinum series p The beds are believed to be of marine origin and are probably of Silurian and Devonian age The platinum which is present in a very finely disseminated state is associated with chromium nickel arsenic antimony iron copper lead zinc silver and gold some of which appear to have been introduced by solutions at a stage subsequent to sedimentation Krusch investigated these deposits in and is of opinion in view of the similarity of the chemical associations with those of the Ural and British Columbian formations that the original source of the platinum was peridotite or other form of basic igneous rock A number of samples analysed by Krusch yielded values ranging from a trace to gm oz troy platinum per ton At the outbreak of war the capital necessary for exploitation had not been raised but in it was stated that treatment works had been erected at Wenden As mentioned above about per cent of the Russian output of platinum before the war was refined in Germany and it is known that German capital was helping to finance the pre war platinum operations of that country Imports The following is a summary of imports into Germany of crude manufactured and scrap platinum in kilograms troy oz for the years From United France Austria Hungary Russia United Other Total Year Kingdom States countries RUSSIA Up to the year Russia produced about per cent of the total world s supply of platinum the metal being derived from extensive deposits of alluvial sands in the Ural Mountains The platiniferous area extends approximately miles along the central part of the chain of mountains in the Government of Perm and along the eastern slope the principal centre of the placers being at Goroblagodat and on the western side at Nizhni Tagilsk Platinum was first discovered in the Urals in and exploitation commenced in the following year In the Russian Government instituted platinum coinage which consisted of rouble rouble and rouble pieces the coins containing about per cent iridium A rouble piece weighed gm and the price paid by the Government to the producers was s d per oz but owing to the subsequent rise in value of platinum the coinage was discontinued in p The platinum industry began to develop in the price at that time being under per lb but from that year onwards the value although subject to considerable fluctuations has steadily increased It has been estimated that since the beginning of the industry in Russia about oz of platinum have been recovered from to c yd of gravel As was explained in Chapter I the official statistics of the Russian output of crude platinum are considered to be low In the following table the estimated and official figures of production are given for the years In oz troy Year Estimated output Official output In the official statistics the Ural mining district is divided into five principal areas The following table shows the annual outputs by districts in recent years In oz troy District South Verkhotur Perm North Verkhotur Tcherdynsk South Ekaterinburg Total Exports of crude platinum from Russia for the years were as follows p To Great Britain France Germany United States Total The platinum industry in Russia has always been mainly in the hands of a few large firms of foreign countries For a long time Johnson Matthey Co Ltd controlled the greater part of the trade In the Soci t Anonyme de l Industrie du Platine was established in Paris and by purchasing a large number of mines and leasing others was able to secure a large share in the control of the industry The refining of the crude platinum has been and still is almost entirely in foreign hands all but approximately per cent of the entire output being refined abroad In it was reported that the construction of a refinery at Ekaterinburg was completed which was to be placed under Government control The principal platinum refining works were formerly those of Johnson Matthey Co Ltd of England but early in the eighties this firm was to a certain extent superseded by Heraeus Co of Hanau Germany They in turn in were compelled to give first place to the Soci t Anonyme de l Industrie du Platine of Paris which became the chief centre of the platinum refining industry a position which it held until the outbreak of war France at that time had a monopoly of per cent of the Russian production This foreign control had an unfavourable effect on the industry and in the Russian Government passed a law forbidding the exportation of crude platinum In July exportation was again permitted subject to a per cent ad valorem export tax and at about the same time an order was issued forbidding the exportation of raw platinum in quantities valued above roubles the price of the metal to be fixed by the State p In February the Government further enacted an order prohibiting the importation of drawn and spun platinum It was hoped by these means to encourage the establishment of domestic refineries In the Government fixed the price at s per oz In March it was reported that the miners were not satisfied and later sales were reported up to per oz of crude metal per cent fine p According to N Vissotzki the platiniferous belt of the Urals geologically speaking consists of four parallel bands striking roughly north and south the westernmost of these made up of crystalline schists forms the watershed between Europe and Asia The next band to the east comprises olivine and mica gabbros diallage peridotites diorites and altered syenites all of which have been erupted from a great depth The third band is made up of Lower Devonian sedimentary rocks shattered and buried in places by diabasic eruptive rocks The eastern portion of this band is formed of eruptive rocks of deep seated origin which may be gneissose granites The fourth or most easterly band is composed of ancient rocks which have been eroded by the advancing sea of Lower Tertiary age The area emerged from the waves as early as the Carboniferous period consequently the accumulation of platinum and in some localities of gold in the surface deposits were not swept away They were concentrated later on in the alluvia perhaps at the time of the most intense glaciation probably in the Pleistocene Throughout the Urals the primary source of the platinum is associated with the eruptive basic rocks among which the platiniferous and auriferous dunite forms three great masses The principal outcrops of platiniferous dunite and platinum bearing alluvia are connected with the second of the four parallel bands mentioned above Towards the south the band becomes discontinuous and finally dies out altogether Here a few outcrops of platiniferous olivine rock contain a small percentage of platinum with osmiridium and other members of the group associated with it The two principal platinum producing districts are in the central Urals and are The Shuvaloff Estates Isov district on the River Iss near Goroblagodat The Demidoff Estates Nizhni Tagilsk district on the Martian River in the South Verkhotur district Prior to the latter field furnished the larger part of the platinum but since then the former has been the most productive and now supplies about per cent of the total output The whole of the platinum is derived from gravel deposits which are usually auriferous and associated with dunite The Isov district Platinum is concentrated in the channels of the Rivers Iss Veeya and Tura In the north of this region it is obtained from the Sosnovki Kytlymi and Mala Kosva Rivers further north again platinum occurs with gold in the Vagran River and in the system comprising the Rivers Lobva Niasma Lialia Aktai Emerlo and Talits the gold here being predominant Other sources of supply of platinum and gold in this district are on the Ivdevl River In the south of the area platinum deposits are worked on the tributaries of the Tagil Salda Imiaun and Tura Rivers p The Nizhni Tagilsk district The richest placers occur in the valleys of the Visim Martian Sisim Chaush and Cherna Rivers Further south platinum is found with gold in the gravels of the Nevian Verkhne Iset Bilenibaev Alapaev Sysert Kyshtym and Mias areas and also in the Tanalyk Sakmar and Urtazym Rivers Other localities of smaller importance are the Nikolae Pavdinsk and Rastes districts in the northern Urals and the Systersk mining district The placers are derived from country rock made up of serpentine gabbro diallage and olivenite the principal associated minerals being quartz zircon ilmenite chromite magnetite spinel native gold and palladium Gold is present in the concentrate in very variable quantities and sometimes contains silver but the latter generally occurs in combination with palladium The crude platinum usually includes some iridium rhodium ruthenium and iron The basic igneous rocks from which the platinum is derived are exposed in the form of discontinuous elliptical outcrops near the summits of the Urals particularly on the western side of the mountains These outcrops attain larger dimensions in the northern and central Urals than further south The process of concentration of platinum in the gravels has clearly extended over a very long period of time and it is probable that the richer gravels have been reconcentrated perhaps several times p Platinum nuggets are rarely found but three of large size were discovered in the Nizhni Tagilsk district their weights respectively being lb lb and lb Duparc in a brief description of the geology of the deposits states that they are essentially of magmatic origin The structure of the rock is in the nature of concentric bandings the felspathic rocks at the outer edge gradually grade into the intermediate stage of pyroxenes until the central dunite is reached composed of olivine and chromite The richness of the gravels is in proportion to the size of the dunite deposits and to the extent of erosion of these rocks According to Duparc platinum ore derived from a pyroxenite source usually contains high percentages of platinum and palladium but low percentages of osmium and iron The same writer estimated in that the reserves were sufficient for about twelve years provided that the same methods of working and rate of extraction were employed during that period The amount of the platinum in the wash is very variable The average yield was formerly over oz per c yd but latterly owing to the gradual exhaustion of the richer deposits the average returns have not exceeded from to dwt per c yd The crude metal assays about per cent platinum from to per cent osmium and iridium with small amounts of ruthenium palladium and gold and about per cent impurities mostly iron and copper The thickness of the pay gravels varies from to ft and about ft may be taken as the average width the overburden running from a few to over ft The extent of the productive area is about sq miles and from to miners were employed before the war p It has been noticed that the platinum deposits are characterized by their uniformity of course not being so sinuous in direction as gold deposits In former times mining was entirely carried on by primitive methods with hand labour but the utilization of dredges has steadily increased since their introduction in In per cent of the total production was obtained by dredging and in this percentage rose to one third of the total output The season during which dredges may be employed extends on the average from the middle of April to the middle of October In the South Verkhotur and Perm areas dredges have been used in the large enterprises but at the small mines the working is very primitive and carried on largely with the help of starateli or tributers In a modern c ft dredge was installed on the Nikolaie Pavdinsk Estate In mines where dredging is not in use the gravels are mined by open cuts or if the overburden is thick shafts are employed The former method is much preferred both on account of its relative cheapness and also because it is possible to obtain a better clean up of the bedrock The usual types of stationary plant in use include the botchka or conical revolving screen the tchaska or puddling machine with a bottom of perforated iron plates and the boronka or conical screen on which the stones and clay are turned over by a double rake The gold is removed by amalgamation with mercury in wood iron or porcelain bowls Special methods are in use in certain parts of Russia for working the deposits during the winter The workings are allowed to freeze and the frozen ground is mined after being partially thawed by means of wood fires The method is simple but care must be taken to ensure that the thawing does not proceed too far otherwise the ground collapses and the workings become flooded The method is suitable for depths to ft and in localities where the snowfall is comparatively slight Latest reports from Russia indicate that no dredges are now working there the platinum being produced by hand methods only Some interesting experiments were recently carried out by V N Chorzhevski in the Nizhni Tagilsk district with a view to testing the commercial possibility of mining platinum in situ The metal here occurs in association with chrome iron ore in dunite rock which in this region extends over an area of sq miles The platinum appears to be present in quantities directly proportional to the amount of chromite in the rock The dunite is first ground under runners the chromite slack is separated from it and after this has undergone a second grinding the metal is separated by washing An experimental test carried out in March is stated to have produced over oz platinum from lb chromite slack Another experiment with lb of grey slack or fines consisting chiefly of undecomposed dunite obtained from the dredges is reported to have yielded oz of platinum Lapland Platinum occurs associated with chromite and diamonds in alluvial deposits on the Ivalo River It is believed to be derived from serpentine rock of which the neighbouring country is largely composed p Finland Platinum has been found in the south in a lode formation containing quartz siderite calcite and dolomite Gold and carbonate of copper are also present in small quantities p PLATINUM CURRENCY In a dispatch to the Great Powers on February the Soviet Government promised to withdraw the decree annulling Russia s foreign debt to pay arrears of interest and giving as a guarantee to an Anglo American syndicate certain important platinum and silver mining concessions in return for which the abandonment of intervention in Russia s internal affairs was demanded To be used in payment of foreign purchases the Government was about to issue platinum credit notes of and roubles the issue to be limited to roubles and backed by platinum reserves of roubles The Government would be ready to convert the platinum reserves into coin if required SPAIN Promising deposits of platinum have recently been reported at Ronda in the province of Malaga Domingo de Orueta a Government geologist having noticed the similarity of the geology of this district to that of the platiniferous deposits of the Urals proceeded a few years ago to explore the area systematically and was soon rewarded in the discovery of the metal The deposits which are alluvial extend along the Verde and Guadaiza rivers and are derived from serpentine and peridotite rocks the latter composed principally of rhombic pyroxene with some spinel and some dunite Chromite occurs in association with the platinum The pay gravels contain about gr platinum per ton and are stated to have an average thickness of ft the depth of overburden in the Guadaiza area where apparently the richer gravels are found being about ft as compared with ft in the Verde locality p The Spanish Government have taken over the exploitation of these deposits and no public prospecting without Government permission is allowed Platinum is known to exist in a number of other localities in Spain especially in the northern districts but so far as is known it occurs in very small quantities of no commercial importance The metal has been recognized in the following rivers Minho Luna Sil Orbigo Gallego Cinca Darro and Lower Jenil where it occurs in the concentrate sands accompanied by magnetite ilmenite zircon and frequently gold ASIA ARMENIA Platinum in association with gold is reported to occur in the district of Batum and Sasun on the Charokh River p BORNEO Platinum was discovered in south eastern Borneo in in the gravels of Gunung Lawack but for a long time the natives were ignorant of its value In recent years it has been obtained on a small scale as a by product in the process of gold washing carried on in the province of Tanah Laut in the south eastern extremity of the island The deposits occur in streams which rise in the Bobaris Mountains where the country rocks are composed of schists and gneisses intruded by serpentine gabbro and diorite dykes p Platinum has however not yet been located in situ In addition to gold the platinum is associated with osmiridium in the gravels the two former being frequently found intimately intergrown The platinum content of the native metal has been found by a number of analyses to vary from about to per cent and that of osmiridium from to per cent The rare mineral laurite a sulphide of ruthenium and osmium was discovered in these deposits According to L Hundeshagen the platinum occurring in the diamond placers of western and south eastern Borneo is in the form of thin scales ranging from to mm in length These platinum scales contain from to per cent of copper evidently as an alloy CHINA In the Uryanchai district of Mongolia situated on the Russian border deposits of auriferous gravels have been worked on a fairly extensive scale for some time past It was announced a few years ago that platinum and iridium had been found in appreciable quantities associated with the gold some large platinum nuggets being obtained from this region in Although no attempt at commercial development has yet been made the prospects of profitable extraction appear to be hopeful Extensive outcrops of olivine rocks have been noticed in the vicinity and the nature of the occurrence is stated to bear some resemblance to that of the platiniferous fields of the southern Urals p JAPAN Platinum occurs in the Yubari garva Pechau and other rivers in the province of Hokkaido It is also found in Nishi Mikawa province of Sado In the former locality gold and iridosmine are associated with the platinum and in the latter gold and iron sands are present In no case has the metal been traced to its parent source In the Hokkaido deposits the average quantity of platinum present is only or per cent of the iridosmine content It is possible that further exploration in these areas will reveal occurrences of greater importance p SUMATRA Platinum is obtained at Sipongi where it occurs with wollastonite and grossularite in limestones and schists near intrusions of granodiorite and augite diorite Gold is also present L Hundeshagen is of opinion that the present ore deposit was originally a layer or a big lens of limestone embedded in the old schists which has by apophyses of granite been altered into garnet and wollastonite being at the same time or very soon afterwards mineralized by hot solutions carrying copper gold platinum etc A sample of slightly decomposed wollastonite with no copper or only minute traces of that metal proved to be richest in platinum the assay showing gm of platinum per kg while samples with to per cent of bornite and malachite contained only traces of platinum and none could be detected in auriferous garnet poor in wollastonite About to metres from the outcrop the concentrated river sand shows small particles of whitish crystalline gold and rounded grains of white platinum the latter varying from to mm in size AFRICA CONGO FREE STATE In the Katanga district platinum and palladium have been reported to occur in certain alluvial gravels accompanied by gold and silver One sample from this locality is stated to have yielded the following amounts per metric ton gr platinum gr gold gr silver It has also been located in situ in sandstones containing gold MADAGASCAR Platinum is produced on a small scale as a by product in alluvial gold mining on the Vatana River near the village of Ambia in the Vatomandry district Traces of the metal have also been found in auriferous gravels in the regions of Fenerive Marolambo and Vandrozo over an area extending along the eastern side of the island for a length of about miles The platinum is apparently derived from the decomposition of pegmatite It is rarely found pure being usually coated with iron oxide and strongly magnetic a property which is utilized in the process of separation from the gold NORTH AMERICA MEXICO Platinum has been shown to exist in the states of Guerrero and Hidalgo in deposits of ferrous clays which are of undoubted sedimentary origin and are apparently laterites The metal exists in a very finely disseminated state invisible to the naked eye UNITED STATES At the beginning of the war there was a considerable shortage of platinum in the country caused partly by the falling off of the imports and in part owing to the increased demand in connexion with munition manufacture California is the principal producer of crude platinum and in this State supplied oz out of the total output of oz with the exception of a few ounces from the State of Washington Alaska and Oregon provided the balance A considerable quantity of foreign crude and manufactured platinum is imported annually as shown in the following tables Imports of Manufactured Platinum into the United States In troy oz From British countries Canada United Kingdom Other British countries Total British countries From foreign countries France Germany Netherlands Norway Russia European Colombia Other foreign countries Total foreign countries Grand total oz Imports of Crude Platinum into United States In troy oz N From British countries Canada United Kingdom Other British possessions Total British countries From foreign countries France Germany Norway Panama Brazil Chile Colombia Other foreign countries Total foreign countries Grand total oz Footnote N Including manufactured platinum In oz of refined platinum metals of which oz is believed to have been of domestic origin were recovered from alloy with other metals and oz were obtained from the refining of scrap metal and sweepings The shortage was also to some extent relieved by the receipt from Russia early in of a special consignment of oz of crude platinum which had been collected in by the Russian English Bank and which was taken out of Russia by F W Draper and delivered to the United States Government It yielded oz platinum oz palladium oz iridium and oz of rhodium a total of per cent of platinum metals slightly above the usual per cent Alaska The first production of platinum in Alaska was in in which year about oz were shipped to the United States In the output rose to oz of which oz were obtained from the Seward Peninsula and oz from the Copper River country In an increased output of oz was partly obtained from alluvial deposits and partly as a by product in the treatment of copper ore of the Salt Chuck mine Ketchikan This mine is a palladium copper mine containing mainly bornite with a little chalcopyrite and the alteration products covellite and chalcocite the metals present being besides copper and palladium gold silver and platinum The ratio of palladium to platinum averages to The concentrates produced representing about per cent of the weight of the ore contain copper per cent gold oz silver oz and platinum metals oz per ton In the Seward Peninsula the larger portion is derived from placer deposits in Dyme Creek Koyuk district where the gravels are primarily worked for gold oz platinum being obtained for every worth of gold In oz were recovered Bear Creek and Sweepstake Creek have also supplied small quantities of platinum and a little is derived from placers on Boob Creek in the Tolstoi district p A possible source of platinum appears to lie in the neighbourhood of the Red Mountain on the Kenai Peninsula The mountain is composed of fine grained dunite in which abundant chromite occurs Up to no placer mining had been attempted in this locality In the Goodro Mine at the head of Kasaan Bay Prince of Wales Island were found in both platinum and palladium the latter in greater amount and carried in bornite and chalcopyrite some chalcocite and covellite are present also in the ore The copper minerals are disseminated through pyroxenite and the country rock consists of limestones slates and other sedimentaries The platinum content is small but regular whilst the amount of palladium present is proportional to the amount of copper there being about oz of palladium to every to per cent units of copper A Bill has been introduced into Congress providing for the incorporation of the United States Platinum Corporation with capital stock of the object of which is to secure a concession from the Government of land areas in Alaska containing platinum sands and to pay for such privilege as a royalty or subsidy one eighth of the net profits obtained from the working of the concession California and Oregon Platinum has been proved to exist over a wide area in placer deposits associated with gold but the proportion of the platinum metals to the gold is usually small Platinum is obtained from sands in streams rising in the belt of serpentine rocks in central California and from the serpentine areas in the Siskiyou and Trinity counties in the north west of the State which continue north east into Curry Josephine and Jackson counties in south western Oregon p The sources of the platinum obtained along the foot hills of the Sierra Nevada were old stream channels on the western slopes of the mountains which are now buried beneath lava several hundred feet deep These deep leads are also mined by drifting for their gold and platinum contents and in a few cases a fair amount of the metals is extracted from them Some platinum is obtained by hydraulic mining but this is carried on with difficulty owing to the prevailing scarcity of water p Platinum occurs in black sands found on the Pacific coast in the counties of Coos Curry and Josephine Oregon and Del Norte California Formerly these beach deposits were rich in platinum but at the present small quantities only are obtainable after stormy weather This area has recently been examined by the United States Bureau of Mines but the results were disappointing In California most of the output of platinum is produced by dredging for gold in the Butte Calaveras and Stanislaus counties p In Trinity county mining is in progress on the Trinity River about miles below Junction City by the Valdos Dredging Co The output from this source for sixteen months in was stated to be gm Platinum with gold and osmiridium is also obtained on the Yuba River about miles east of Marysville in Yuba county by the Yuba Consolidated Goldfields p Some alluvial platinum has been recovered at the Bean Hill Gold Mine situated miles south east of Placerville and this locality is at present under investigation Californian metal contains from to per cent iridium Its origin is believed to be the serpentine and olivine bearing rocks of the Sierra Nevada and other ranges In Oregon in addition to the platinum obtained from the beach deposits near Bullards and Marshfield p it occurs in placer deposits rich in chromite in south west Oregon the principal output being derived from the Waldo district Platinum also exists in small quantities in streams in the neighbourhood of the Blue Mountains eastern Oregon where the Powder River Gold Dredging Co in Sumpter district produces on a small scale Other platiniferous localities in eastern Oregon are the Granite and Canyon districts and Spanish Gulch in Wheeler county p Colorado Platinum is known to exist in the black sands from Clear Creek Its presence has also been reported in the gold gravels of the Iron Hill placer at Como where it occurs mechanically combined with magnetite Another occurrence recently discovered is in a vein worked by the Rollcall Mining Co near Villa Grove An assay of material from this vein taken at a depth of ft showed the following values gold oz platinum oz silver oz and copper per cent p Nevada In the occurrence of platinum in Clark county was noticed by the United States Geological Survey to be in association with copper nickel and cobalt ores from the Key West and Great Eastern Mines near Bunkerville The ore bodies are contained in pegmatites and basic intrusions which carry pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite the platinum content in the ore averaging about oz per ton In platinum with palladium was discovered at the Boss Gold Mine situated miles west of Goodsprings in Clark county The mine was originally worked for copper and later for its copper and gold contents The country rock consists of limestone of middle Carboniferous age intruded by sills of quartz monzonite porphyry the ore bodies occurring in a fault zone in the limestone The copper ores comprise mainly chrysocolla and malachite and contain traces only of platinum The gold ore occurs in a fine grained siliceous matrix containing a bismuth bearing variety of plumbo jarosite a hydrous sulphate of iron and lead The rare metals are present in the free state being apparently alloys of gold platinum and palladium In the Boss Mine shipped worth of platinum bearing ore A plant of tons monthly capacity has recently been erected at Los Angeles California for the treatment of its complex ores which average per cent of copper per cent bismuth and oz of platinum and palladium oz of gold and oz of silver per ton The pulp from ore pulverized to mesh is agitated with sulphuric acid per cent The acid solution contains the copper and about per cent of the platinum The copper is precipitated as cement copper together with the platinum by means of scrap iron The remainder of the platinum together with the gold and silver is first leached with and then precipitated from a neutral solution of calcium chloride The inventors of the process claim that approximately per cent of the copper per cent of the platinum metals gold and silver and over per cent of the bismuth are recovered by this process Metals of the platinum group have recently been shown to exist in small quantities in the ore of the Oro Amigo Mine situated between and miles north east of the Boss Mine This ore differs from that of the Boss Mine in that bismuth and plumbo jarosite are absent According to H K Riddell the platinum metals content averages from a trace to oz per ton of ore North Carolina At Mason Mountain in Mason county platinum occurs associated with rhodonite garnet biotite and iron sulphides in metamorphic deposits New York It was reported a few years ago that platinum existed in large quantities in alluvial sands of the Adirondack region J M Clarke the New York State Geologist examined the occurrence in and found that platinum was present in traces only the deposits being of no economic importance p Pennsylvania At Lancaster county platinum is associated with pyrite chalcopyrite and galena in mica schist and also at Boyertown in black Triassic shale Washington The production of platinum on a small scale has been reported from beach deposits at the mouth of the south fork of the Lewis River near Yacolt and also on beaches southward from the Straits of Juan de Fuca p The metal has also been located at various places in the Cascade Mountains in the central part of the State Wyoming Palladium and platinum in the proportion of to are obtained at the Rambler Mine in Albany county the metals occurring as sperrylite in copper ore contained in the kaolinized portion of a dunite dyke intrusive into granite gneiss The ore consists of covellite chalcocite chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite with nickel and gold It is stated that the platinum and palladium contents vary directly with the percentage of copper present a typical assay giving the following values copper per cent gold oz silver oz palladium oz and platinum oz per ton Utah Platinum and gold in very fine particles occur in the Green River east of Vernal also in the Colorado River near Hite below the mouth of the Green River Attempts to mine these deposits have so far proved unsuccessful due largely to the inaccessibility of the region as well as the finely divided condition of the platinum p SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL Jos Vieira do Couto in first pointed out that platinum occurs in the sands of the Lages River near Concei ao Minas Geraes According to E Hussak platinum in that region occurs only in the alluvium of rivers having their rise on the eastern slope of the Serra do Espinha o The platinum is accompanied by black pebbles of quartz tourmaline rocks magnetite hematite rutile octahedrite xenotime monazite senaite pseudomorphs of rutile after octahedrite captivos zircon and gold which is sometimes of a copper red colour palladium gold Palladic gold was formerly called ouro branco white gold by the miners At Condado further north on the eastern slope of the same Serra platinum also occurs with very similar associations The platinum from both localities occurs in bunchy mammillated and globular forms concave within with thin walls having a radiated fibrous structure under the microscope It is frequently in thin foliated crusts having the characteristic structure of hematite It was accurately described by Wollaston in and Hussak thinks the primary formation was an olivine rock or gabbro while the platinum is secondary having been most probably re deposited from solutions resulting from the decomposition of platiniferous pyrites or of sperrylite PtAs minerals derived possibly from the neighbouring schistose quartzite or from the overlying conglomeratic quartzite The platinum of Condado although comparable as regards density to the Russian platinum is very rich in palladium is non magnetic and contains practically no iron An analysis by G Florence gave the following percentages insoluble residue platinum iridium palladium iron undetermined rhodium and osmium In the Rio Abaet Minas Geraes platinum very different in appearance and chemical composition from that of the Serra do Espinha o occurs in placer deposits associated with gold diamonds and the following minerals rolled pieces of a hydro phosphate of barium and aluminium gorceixite marumb of miners garnet almandite pyrope ashy blue oxide of titanium bagageira regarded as a good indicator for diamonds magnetite chromite and calcium titanate perovskite Pyroxene olivine rock a typical picrite porphyry rich in perovskite and granular magnetite rocks rich in titanium have been observed by Oliveira in the vicinity Hence it is highly probable that the platinum as in the Urals came from olivine rocks The platinum occurs in thin lamin strongly rolled and rarely in cubical crystals with the edges visibly rounded It is strongly magnetic and contains no palladium Minute crystals of osmiridium may occur with those of platinum and in the platinum particles are found regular inclusions of osmiridium as at Nizhne Turinsk in the Urals the platinum of which locality it resembles in chemical composition magnetic properties and crystalline structure The following analysis shows the percentage and composition of a general sample insoluble residue iron palladium trace copper trace platinum metals The auriferous alluvial of the Cuyab and Coxim rivers in the southern part of the State of Matto Grosso also contain some platinum According to Luiz Caetano Ferraz platinum occurs in the River Coxip Mirim where golddredging is carried on combined with palladium iron osmium and iridium in small spherical grains flattened on one side of a brilliant white colour and strongly magnetic It is found in alluvial deposits associated with various kinds of quartz and oxides of iron marcasite arsenopyrite rutile anatase almandine garnet black tourmaline monazite staurolite white topaz sphene cassiterite wolfram graphite galena and native silver In the State of Bahia platinum has been found in Ituass Feira de S Anna and Serra do Assuru and it is said to occur at S o Bartholomeu and in the Serras do Pitango and Macahubes Platinum also occurs in Brazil as rare disseminations in the gold bearing jacutinga intercalated in the itabirites e g at Gongo Socco Mine long since abandoned The jacutinga occurs as narrow bands and nuclei in the itabirites containing a high percentage of gold with much talc clay and pulverulent pyrolusite As accessory minerals zircon rutile cassiterite and tourmaline occur Hussak thinks that the gold bearing jacutinga has been derived from altered pegmatite veins From analyses made by Johnson on the Gongo Socco bullion it would appear that the percentages of silver and platinum decreased while those of copper and palladium increased with depth Henwood The percentages of palladium varied from to and that of platinum from to At Candonga gold occurs in an eruptive rock rich in magnetite enclosed in itabirite and is probably of contact metamorphic origin The gold occurs in grains of high standard and with it are found fine indented scales of palladic gold of a bright copper red colour At Itabira do Matto Dentro gold occurs in jacutinga lying between a micaceous iron schist rich in quartz and an enormous solid bed of itabirite The palladium gold may be copper red dark brown or silver white in colour Native platinum also occurs with the gold Grains of platinum have also been found in the most northerly of the auriferous lenticular masses which occur near the Bruscus River near Pernambuco in Cambrian crystalline schists The matrix is a coarse white quartz containing small quantities of the arsenides and sulphides of iron and the sulphides of copper lead and zinc Platinum although widely distributed in Brazil occurs in such small quantities that so far there has been no production but in the near future richer and more extensive deposits may be discovered or it may be found practicable to win the metal from those already known as an important by product Palladium gold or porpezite is a natural alloy of palladium and gold and may contain up to per cent of the former metal It is found in Brazil in gold washings and also in the gold bearing jacutinga reefs at Gongo Socco Candonga and Itabira do Matto Dentro In Henwood showed that the palladic gold from Gongo Socco contained to a moderate depth from surface from to per cent of platinum Palladium gold has also been reported from gold washings in the Caucasus near Batoum Ruer concludes from an examination of the freezing point curves of artificial alloys of gold and palladium that these alloys form a continuous series of mixed crystals and that there is no indication of chemical combinations COLOMBIA This republic is the second largest producer of platinum in the world and in pre war years supplied about per cent of the world s total output Owing to the decline of the Russian supply and the increased demand for the metal the industry has in recent years received a considerable stimulus and in Colombia s production rose to approximately one third of the Russian output Platinum was first introduced into Europe from Colombia in although the metal was known in America for some time previously p In the value of platinum stood at to U S per oz and in the price had further dropped to from to per oz As a result platinum was rejected as waste in the operation of refining gold by the dry blowing system Later when platinum became valuable much of this dumped metal was recovered notably in Quibdo the capital of the Choc district where much gold refining was carried on The following table gives the outputs of crude platinum from Colombia in recent years principally produced in the Choc district Year Oz troy estimated The larger portion of the production is shipped to the United States the exports to that country for the years being as follows Year Oz troy The crude platinum is estimated at to per cent fine The price in fluctuated from to s per oz the average for the year being nearer the latter amount During the United States Government fixed the price at per oz which stimulated production The deposits are alluvial and consist of re concentrates of older gravels The principal source of supply is at the head of the San Juan River which enters the Pacific Ocean north of Buenaventura the richest deposits occurring in the Condoto Opagado and Tamanal Rivers tributaries of the San Juan Platinum is also obtained in the Upper Atrato River which flows northward to the Caribbean Sea It is nearly always found associated with gold In the gravels of the San Juan River the two metals are present in about equal proportions and in those of the Atrato the ratio is approximately of gold to of platinum The area including the watersheds of the San Juan and Upper Atrato Rivers is known as the Choc district T Ospina Director of the Colombian School of Mines estimates that in the area are sq miles of gold and platinum deposits the Mira River forming the southern boundary of the area In he estimated that there were in it c yd of actually profitable gravel with a reserve of yd of possibly profitable ground Platinum has also been recovered in much smaller amounts on the Micay River in the Barbacoas district near the frontier of Ecuador The stream beds in which platinum occurs are those in which Tertiary conglomerates have become eroded the river gravels about the areas underlain by that formation are barren The conglomerates are composed of rounded boulders of basic rocks such as diabase melaphyre peridotite and dunite p At Novita Vieja in the centre of the Choc district a bed of conglomerate to ft thick has been laid bare over an area miles long and mile wide through the sluicing away of the overlying sands It contains oz of gold and oz of platinum per ton According to Castillo the parent rock is a typical gabbro pyroxene predominating over the felspar p Platinum has been found in the Choc district in serpentine rock Granite also occurs in the same district traversed by quartz lodes containing palladium iridium osmium and rhodium Colombian crude platinum contains from to per cent platinum the remaining to per cent consisting chiefly of iridium and osmium The sands in which it occurs are described as brown in colour and carrying besides platinum and gold the heavy minerals chromite magnetite and ilmenite p In the past mining operations have been very irregularly carried on by primitive methods of working but dredges are now being employed in increasing numbers In a dredge was operated on the Condoto River in the province of Choc by the Anglo Colombian Development Company and showed good results Native methods of working are very simple The alluvial gravels derived from dried up beds of ancient rivers are hand washed with the use of the batea or dish Where the metal occurs in the bed of a river it is obtained by diving girls who work down to the platiniferous gravels removing the gravel in small dishes the men being employed in washing the gravels on the river banks About per cent of the total output is recovered by these primitive methods A large portion of the industry is in the hands of two companies one of which is the South American Gold and Platinum Company of New York a Lewisohn company which has absorbed the interests of the above mentioned Anglo Colombian Development Company Ltd the Gold Fields American Development Company Ltd and Johnson Matthey Co Ltd of London The second company the British Platinum and Gold Corporation Ltd has recently amalgamated with the Paris Transvaal Gold Mines Ltd taking in the latter s interests on the Opogodo and other places The question of transporting platinum concentrate to the coast is not a matter of much difficulty as the Atrato River is navigable as far as Quibdo and the San Juan can be ascended by vessels of moderate draught for over miles inland An estimate of average working costs appears to be d per c yd for dredging and d for hydraulicking In new platiniferous deposits were discovered in the Caceres district between the Cauca and Nechi Rivers in the department of Antioquia The mineralized area extends along the Caceri River a distance of miles the width at the north end being miles and ft at the southern extremity p ECUADOR Platinum occurs in association with the gold obtained from steam gravels in the area covered by the Rivers Bogota Cachabi Uimbi Santiago and Cayapas but it has not so far been found in sufficient quantities to be of economic importance Dredging has been employed in mining these deposits but does not appear to have been a success and operations are now largely confined to native washings FRENCH GUIANA Platiniferous gold bearing sands are found in the Aporuague River the metal according to an analysis by A Danmer having the following composition in percentages platinum

Character set encoding UTF Produced by Greg Weeks Mary Meehan and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http www pgdp net START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LAKE OF FIRE Lake of Fire by FRANK BELKNAP LONG When you ve been to Mars when you ve struggled with men and ships and supplies like some tremendous Herculean figure in the morning of the world you ll never really feel at home on Earth Transcriber s Note This etext was produced from Planet Stories May Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U S copyright on this publication was renewed Steve found the mirror in the great northwestern desert It was lying half buried in the sand and the wind howled in fury over it and when he bent to pick it up the sun smote him like a shining blade dividing his tall body into blinding light and wavering shadow I knew it was a Martian mirror before he straightened The craftsmanship was breathtaking and could not have been duplicated on Earth It was shaped like an ordinary hand mirror but its glass surface was like a lake of fire with depth beyond depth to it and the jewels sparkling at its rim were a deep aquamarine which seemed to transmute the sun glow into shimmering bands of starlight I could have told Steve that such mirrors by their very nature were destructive When a man carries a hopeless vision of loveliness about with him when he lives with that vision night and day he ceases to be the undisputed master of his own destiny She s alive Jim Steve said A woman dead fifty thousand years A woman from a civilization that flourished before the dawn of human history Take it easy Steve I warned The Martians simply knew how to preserve every aspect of a mirrored image Say howdedo to her if you like Press your lips to the glass and see what happens But don t mistake an imitation of life for the real thing An imitation of life Steve flared Man she just smiled at me She s aware of us I tell you Sure she is Her brain was mirrored too every aspect of its electro dynamic structure preserved forever by a science that s lost forever Get a grip on yourself Steve I was hot and tired and dusty My throat was parched and I didn t feel much like arguing with him But I had my reasons for being stubborn Men have found Martian mirrors and gone mad I said Don t take any chances Steve We don t know yet what it s rigged with Why not play it safe A thousand cycles of direct current should melt it down Melt her down Steve s eyes narrowed in sudden fury Why it would be murder Steve got up and brushed sand from his knees He held the mirror up so that the red Martian sunlight caught and aureoled the splendor of a face that offered a man no chance of help if he ever let go A pale beautiful face the eyes fringed with long dark lashes the lips parted in a mocking smile A living image capable of mercurial changes of mood unnaturally still one moment smiling and animated the next One thing at a time I thought Don t drive him too hard Some men have carried them about for years I said But just remember what falling in love with an image can mean You ll never hold her in your arms Steve And compulsions can kill She s alive as flesh and blood is alive he said glaring at me Easy Steve I could see that I was going to have trouble with my stout hearted buddy Captain Stephen Claymore He could have stared at a mountain of gold unmoved He could have knelt with a wry chuckle and let a handful of diamonds trickle through his wiry bronze knuckled hands in utter contempt for what diamonds could buy on Earth He could have thrown back his head and laughed at wealth at glory at anything you want to name that men prize highly on Earth But a beautiful woman was a temptation apart A beautiful woman Steve grabbed my arm Look out Tom he cried Watch it The bullet whizzed past like a heat maddened insect Steve leapt back and I flattened myself The attack was no great surprise When people take up a new way of life when they pull up stakes and go striding into the sunrise strife paces after like a ravenous hound red tongue lolling When the first colonists from Earth swarmed into the crumbling Martian cities a good third of them ended up in stony desolation with their hearts drilled through They danced to riotous tunes calling for louder music and stronger wine and they fought savagely to set up little kingdoms of tyranny eighty feet square Everywhere anarchy reigned and haggard eyed desperate men crouched behind smoke blackened ruins and held off other men as greedy as themselves They fought and died by dozens by hundreds their minds inflamed by the quickly made discovery that the Martian cities were vast treasure troves You had to go prospecting you had to search and when you found your own shining treasure you didn t want to share it with any man alive Steve had his gun trained on the wall ahead when he ducked down at my side Yes sir I whispered half to myself This is going to be rough They asked for it Steve said His gun roared twice From the wall ahead came a burst of gunfire in reply If they think they re going to get this mirror away from me I looked at his grim sweat beaded face I ll help you fight for it I said So nice of you he grunted Then maybe you ll have sense enough to bury it face down in the sand Guns went off thirty feet directly in front of us Red sand geysered up granite cracked and splintered You could feel the awful heat of the blazing exchange of bullets I could see faces between the chinks Malignant faces moving from peep hole to peep hole like scavenger birds hopping about in the desert I was aiming at one of the peep holes when Steve groaned and sagged against me His gun arm sagged and I could see that a bullet had pierced his shoulder high up I m sorry Tom he whispered hoarsely I was careless damn it Never mind Steve I said Now they ll close in and get you Better take my gun You can use two guns I won t need two guns Steve I said I m walking into the open with my hands raised You re crazy he breathed his eyes on my face We re outnumbered five to one They ll drop you the instant you step out from behind this wall My gun was hot and smoking I smiled and tossed it to the sand I ll be back in a minute and fix up that shoulder I said You ll be walking to your death he said They ve been trailing us for days hoping we d stumble on something They must have seen me pick up that mirror They trailed us because they thought we looked experienced rugged I said They thought we were following a map They just haven t got what it takes to go prospecting for themselves They re hyenas of the desert Steve All right hyenas That means they won t respect a white flag If you walk out with your hands raised they ll burn you down before you ve taken five steps I steadied my helmet and unloosed my collar so that I wouldn t feel cramped Don t worry Steve I said I knew they saw me the instant I stepped out from behind the wall The silence was ominous and I could feel their eyes upon me hot and deadly I didn t raise my hands It didn t seem quite right to let them think I was seeking a truce A man may be a fool to play fair with killers but something made me change my mind about raising my hands I d give them their chance ten seconds I wouldn t try to bargain for those ten seconds by walking toward them under false colors I d just trust to luck and Steve had never seen the weapon I held in my palm It was a tiny electrostatic accelerator tube capable of flexible high precision control of ions with energies up to twelve million electron volts It was a simple thing and unbelievably destructive It made no sound at all But ten seconds after I clicked it on the desert directly in my path was glowing white hot Just a glow white dazzling for an instant Then a dull rumbling shook the ground and the wall opposite blackened and crumbled The heat was like a blast of incandescent helium gas from a man made sun I turned and walked back to where Steve was lying I didn t want to do it that way I said But I had no choice It was them or us Steve seemed not to realize we were no longer in danger There was fear in his eyes and he was staring at me as if I d just returned from the dead In a way I had A man may die fifty deaths while counting off ten seconds in his mind I ll give you something to help you sleep Steve I said It didn t take me long to dress and bind up his wound He winced once or twice but he never took his eyes from the mirror You promised to bury it face down in the sand I said He looked at me You know better than that he said I promised nothing of the sort It s like falling in love with a ghost only worse I said That s where you re wrong There s nothing ghostly about her I mixed him a sleeping draught using the little water we had left In five minutes he was snoring I pried the mirror from his fingers and propped it up against a rock so that he could see her face when he woke up Then I stretched myself out in the sand kicked off my shoes and stared up at the sky The sun was just sinking to rest and there was a thin sprinkling of stars in the middle of the sky The stars seemed cold and immeasurably remote Would it work out Could it possibly work out Was I sticking out my neck in a gamble so big it was like attempting to pierce the sun and hammer out a new humanity on a great blazing anvil heated to millions of degrees centigrade I laughed alone with my thoughts Nothing dared nothing gained What does a man gain by striking bargains with the mouse in himself I awoke in the cool dawn The morning mists had rolled back and the red desert looked almost beautiful in the sun glow Steve was sitting up staring at the mirror The light shifted suddenly and I could see the radiance which smouldered in the depths of the glass I got up walked to the wall and peered over Steve s shoulder The girl was looking at him her face so beautiful it fairly took my breath away It was as though after a lifetime of wandering she d found the only man in the world for her Her face was bright with sympathy with compassion for Steve But Steve sat slumped in utter dejection his eyes burning holes in his face He didn t even look up when I spoke to him She knows Tom he whispered hoarsely She turned pale when that bullet hit me She was relieved when you dressed the wound She s been watching over me all night like an angel of mercy You ll need her more and more I said You know what the end will be Steve Complete hopelessness in an empty room He stood up his face savage I never asked your advice he ground out I m not asking it now I ve got to save you Steve I said I love her do you hear I don t care what happens to me I picked up the mirror before he could guess my purpose I swung about and I brought that rare and beautiful object down on the rock Steve had been sitting on There was a splintering crash a crackling burst of white flame Illustration There was a splintering crash a crackling burst of flame Steve gave a great despairing cry He stood for an instant staring down at the shattered fragments of the mirror Then he came at me like a charging bull his eyes bloodshot I clipped him lightly on the jaw That s all I wanted to know Steve I said Thanks pal I looked down at him lying in a crumpled heap at my feet I was glad he hadn t fallen on his wounded side He was plenty sturdy and he came from a long lived family and I didn t think a little clip on the jaw could hurt him I hoped he d forgive me when he woke up That was important because I thought a lot of Steve When you ve been to Mars when you ve fought your way through the red and raging dust storms and labored beneath the naked glare of the sun and juggled with men and ships and supplies like some tremendous Herculean figure in the morning of the world you ll never really feel at home on Earth You ll see the world of ordinary men and women as a vision of Lilliput too small to be measurable in terms of human worth You ll be lost and helpless blind and staggering beneath the weight of a memory you can t throw off A memory of bigness too much bigness integrated into your every fiber as much a part of you as the beating of your heart You ll lurch and over reach yourself you ll never feel at home on Earth never really at home You ll find a way to come back to Mars I smiled down at Steve So Steve had come back to go prospecting like an ordinary greed driven man and only I knew he was one of the scant dozen great constructive geniuses who had made possible man s conquest of space He was an engineer a physicist and a man in need of a partner So I d just stepped up and introduced myself Tom Gierson who knew every square foot of Mars For my purpose one Earth name was as good as another and Tom Gierson had a sturdy ring Hard bitten Tom Gierson bronzed by the harsh Martian sunlight as much at home in the desert as the sturdy little spiked plants that thrust their way up through the parched soil when the spring begins to break Steve s finest achievement was years in the past but he was a young man still with a young man s need of a woman as great as himself to share every moment of his waking life That woman was waiting for him but I had to be sure that he d really go berserk if I smashed the glass I was sure now I raised my arm and out of the ruins the Martians came Steady hands lifted Steve up and a hushed silence ringed Steve round Azala I said Where is she Then I saw her She was advancing straight toward me through the glare of sunset on desert sand a shining eagerness in her eyes The girl of the mirror young and straight and alive her hair the color of red sand and sunset glow her eyes twin dark stars She paused before me and raised her eyes in questioning wonder Go to him I said He will never love another woman I can promise you that She ran to Steve with a little glad cry and fell to her knees beside him I wanted to break through the circle and slap Steve on the back and wish him all the happiness on Mars The first Earthian to wed a Martian and it was tremendous and I wanted to tell Steve But how could I tell him that Martians had numerous ways of watching Earthians the very best being mirrors which were really two way televisual instruments How could I tell him that the alert Martian women had all been trained to watch and observe Earthians day and night And all the while the Earthians thought they were carrying about with them in beautiful jeweled artifacts of a dead culture the living images of their heart s desire Steve was awake now and sitting up straight and the image was warm and alive in his arms But how could I make Steve understand I had a wild impulse to say I d change places with you if I could Steve She s just about the cutest kid I know You get to thinking that way when you ve mingled with Earthians around desert campfires studying them as you d study a new neighbor who comes knocking at your door the neighbor you fear at first and are never quite sure of until you really get to know and like him You see we had so much to offer one another A young race constructive brawling shouting its defiance to the stars And an old race imaginative sensitive heirs to a civilization on the wane but needing just a few Steves to make it young and great again I d picked Steve because he was one of the shining ones of Earth I d known from the start that persuading him to wed a Martian woman would take plenty of doing Earthians are funny that way Love to them is a complex thing a web that has to be skillfully woven right from the start Beauty alone isn t enough You have to say to them You ll never hold that woman in your arms Can t you see how hopeless it is Then the iron goes deep If a love flies straight in the teeth of despair and comes out all right in the end it will be as strong as death So I d arranged for Steve to stumble on the mirror to pick up that two way televisual circuit into a very special paradise for two And I d opposed and warned him just to make sure he d think of himself as a man facing hopeless odds to win through to an undying love On the other side it was easier Azala had fallen in love with Steve before we put her on the other end of that televisual circuit But seeing him wounded and in need of her had turned it into what Earthians call a great love Perhaps Earthians would someday smash the aura that had flamed about the heads of the Martian rulers for fifty thousand years I d done my best to smash it I had gone simply and humbly among Earthians seeking a fresh wind to trundle the cinders of a dying culture I dreamed of Martians and Earthians standing equal and strong and proud hands linked in friendship cemented by bonds of kinship separated by no gulfs such as now yawned before me separating me from Steve I wanted to shout Good luck Steve Azala You re good kids and you deserve the best Then I remembered that Steve was nearly forty not quite a kid by Earthian standards But looking at Azala I was pretty sure that Steve still had his best years ahead of him I wanted to go up to him and shake his hand for the last time But now the hands of my people were tugging at my shoulders stripping off the Earthian garments I d worn so long with scant respect for my desire to be as human and regular as the next guy They got the suit off and then I saw the old familiar cloak purple and billowing out with shimmering star images and I shuddered a little because I knew I d never really feel at ease wearing it from that moment on They got me into the cloak and they bent down and straightened the stiff imperial folds and I was suddenly bored and deathly weary A chill wind from the stars seemed to blow over me but I stood straight and still and allowed them to fasten on the cloak the great glowing jewel I d worn from childhood Steve saw me then He was sitting up very straight his hand on Azala s tumbled red gold hair and I heard him say Holy smoke I stared down at the jewel blazing and shuddering and shivering in the desert air and I shut my eyes tight wishing for the first time in my life that it did not proclaim me Tulan Sharm the Glorious One Temporal Ruler of

CHAPTER I A DISCOVERY Near the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek the yacht Day Dream lay at anchor on a certain day in September two years ago The driving rain only served to give her white hull with its trimmings of gold an additional luster bringing into yet bolder relief the polished mahogany and walnut inboard woodwork Two sailors and an old colored steward remained below to escape an unnecessary wetting and the fifty ton beauty tugged at the cable as if trying to escape from her moorings before her caretakers should be aware of the fact On the river bank half hidden by a clump of trees was the old stone house owned by Henry Mansfield formerly a captain in the China trade but now retired Having accumulated considerable wealth he believed it would be more pleasant to remain ashore permanently but after a short time of idleness his love for the sea returned with redoubled force and as a result the Day Dream was purchased On her the captain spent considerably more than half his time and now the little craft was provisioned for a long southern cruise much to the delight of the owner s son Gilbert and his nephew Nelson Duncan who had after no slight difficulty succeeded in gaining permission to make the voyage The boys were on shore overhauling their traps preparatory to leaving early next morning and having considerable trouble in deciding just what should be left behind We ve laid out a big pile of stuff Gilbert said as he surveyed the guns fishing tackle clothes and a general assortment of odds and ends which both he and his cousin had thought would be necessary to their comfort and pleasure during the voyage but if we throw anything out it will be just what we may want most when the yacht is at sea But how are we to get so much aboard In case your trunk and mine won t hold it all there s an old chest in the attic which will be the very ticket If it doesn t stop raining pretty soon we ll have to get a piece of tarpaulin to cover them while going out to the schooner That the old chest would be needed was learned very soon and Gil said with a sigh There s no question but that something must be left We ll pack the most important and then decide as to the rest Come on it won t take long to overhaul what is in the attic The only idea in the minds of the boys was to secure that which would serve as a receptacle for their goods until the same could be carried to the schooner and on finding the well worn chest it was only natural to first make sure that it was empty The rusted lock was fastened and eager to complete the work as soon as possible Gil knocked the hasp off by kicking at it after which the lid was thrown open At first glance one would have said that it contained nothing but on turning it upside down several articles rolled out Idle curiosity rather than a belief that anything important would be found caused the boys to pick up the contents and Nelse cried as he went toward the window Say Gil here s a piece of an old newspaper containing what appears to be an old story Where did the chest come from I don t know Read what you have found if it is interesting There is a long account here but if you can keep quiet a few moments I ll make it out in spite of the many creases and the dirt Then Nelse began the following North of that wild promontory which projects itself into the tropic waters of the Mexican Gulf at the northwestern extremity of Hayti and four miles to seaward of the ancient town lies a rocky inlet known as Tortuga de Mar In size and aspect it is insignificant Yet lilliputian and unfamiliar though it now is it gave birth to the most merciless and picturesque class of marine cutthroats known to history Keep that until we start Gil said impatiently as his cousin paused to take a long breath Just now we want to get our traps aboard instead of reading some musty tale Wait a moment and find out what it means We ve got plenty of time Nelse said and then he continued Back in the opening decades of the seventeenth century adventurous criminals from throughout the Antilles began to collect on the islet and in a few years Tortuga became the recognized headquarters of the Spanish Main From it as from a fever germ went out a fire of blood piracy and lawlessness which spread over the waters of the Western World Tortuga was settled in the first years of this century by Spanish pioneers from the island known as Hispanola or Little Spain It was given the fanciful name of Tortuga de Mar The Sea Tortoise from its resemblance in shape to that amphibian The settlers were a worthy and simple folk for the most part fishermen who for a few months in the twelve varied life by hunting the wild cattle which fed in the wooded coast lands Scarcely had they become well established on the Tortoise when one morning in May they were mystified at the sight of a pinnace load of strange seamen landing on the key which faces the mouth of their harbor Fifteen restless spirits from the French colony of St Christopher had with the adventurous recklessness which marked that day and those waters set out for the best location which fortune and a west wind should put in their way They were allowed to put up sapodilla shelters at the harbor mouth and also to shoot their French bullets into wild bulls on the opposite coast In a few weeks it became evident that the rascally strangers could slaughter and boucan more beeves in a day than the entire Spanish community could in three Boucanning by the way was a peculiar process of curing flesh by jerking salting and drying in the sunshine the term being derived from an aboriginal word applied by the cannibal Caribbes to the curing of human flesh Such was the skill of the intruders in converting the bulls into a superior merchantable product by means of the boucan that the Spanish derisively applied the native word to them As Tortuga lay directly in the path of European vessels bound for Mexican ports the fifteen Frenchmen immediately built up a thriving business in boucanned beef Doubloons pieces of eight and moidores became to them as shells or seabeans to the Spanish fishermen Word went back apace to St Christopher throwing that island into such an uproar that the craze to go a boucanning carried its most unruly seamen to the Tortoise Frenchmen came down upon the islet like a swarm of mosquitoes and overran it before the simple Spanish folks could recover from their astonishment Ominous growlings were heard among the original settlers but for such trivial matters as round Spanish oaths the intruders cared never a whit Just before dawn December the Spanish islanders met at the plaza of their little town and descended headlong upon the intruders at the boucanning beaches Then began a massacre during which the intruders were cut down wherever found Immediately after this the boucanning foreigners formed themselves into a band composed of a collection of couples Each two hunters made common property of all possessions of either They bound themselves by every oath to an imperishable brotherhood Each swore to avenge with death any insult offered to the other The two hunted and lived together by day slept together by night and were as one flesh and always as the band ranged the coast valleys grew the purpose of avenging the Tortuga massacre A few months later the Frenchmen took the islanders by surprise A carnival of butchery ensued When it was completed the village was burned The most lawless of the murderers was one Pierre Le Gros a sailor of oxlike frame and weight hailing originally from Dieppe who with twenty seven fellow spirits stole a small sloop from a Tortugan skipper and started on a nautical foray on whatsoever Spanish merchantmen fate might cast in his course The act was of sufficient gravity to daunt even the chosen crew of cutthroats captained by Pierre had the proposed prey been anything but Spanish since it was plain piracy For two days the sloop ran on before a northerly wind swinging down into the Caribbean Sea but sighting no craft On the third afternoon out Pierre spied a galleon one of the Panama pearl fleet which had been separated from its sister vessels in a recent hurricane Until night shut down he craftily kept away toward the windward horizon Then under cover of the darkness he swiftly and silently approached coming alongside at daybreak The entire twenty eight buccaneers boarded the galleon leaving their sloop adrift Six men rushed headlong to the gunroom taking immediate possession Six more went to the clumsy steering apparatus while Pierre with the remaining fifteen hove the morning watch overboard and made for the cabin On bursting into the captain s room Pierre found the worthy Don playing at cards with his officers and discussing a goodly measure of Madeira Before the captain could speak the pirates swarmed into the apartment and covered the group with their pistols In less than three minutes the prize was theirs The crew were marooned and the galleon taken to France where she and her cargo quickly disposed of the buccaneers left with all speed to rendezvous at the Tortuga When the intelligence of this exploit reached the Tortoise the entire island was thrown into a hubbub Nothing was thought of but to go buccaneering for galleons Brig after brig and ship after ship were fitted out and in a year this species of piracy became a recognized business Ten years later the Spanish commerce in these waters had been almost entirely destroyed The sea was forsaken for the richer prizes on land The rich capital of Campeche was sacked to be in turn followed by Panama and the curers of beef had become such a power as to attract the attention of every nation Is that all Gil asked as Nelse ceased reading Every word and it isn t such a bad sort of story except that there s not more than half enough I wonder why your father has been keeping it in the chest I don t believe he knew it was here But look at the rest of this stuff Do you suppose these have anything to do with the piece of newspaper As he spoke Gil picked up the other articles and he and Nelse were gazing at them in perplexity when Captain Mansfield entered the attic CHAPTER II AT SEA Well what are you boys hunting for Pirates gold Captain Mansfield asked with a hearty laugh as he looked over Gil s shoulder We came here for this old chest because our trunks won t hold all we want to carry and in it found these things which I don t suppose amount to anything but I can t make out why you or any one else would want to keep them As he spoke Gil laid on the lid of the box the different apparently useless articles which had fallen out when the hasp was broken They all had that peculiar musty salty odor which tells of months spent in the forecastle while the good ship plows her way across this or that ocean one day aided by favoring winds and on the next battling for life with the spirit of the tempest First the newspaper story was placed before Captain Mansfield then a small coil of thin well waxed cord then a piece of hard dark colored wood about four inches long by two wide with the following marks rudely cut as if with a sheathknife Illustration A fragment of an old British admiralty chart showing a portion of the northwestern end of the Island of Hayti was next examined and then Gil unfolded a rough drawing of which the sketch below is an exact copy Illustration Do you know where these things came from Gil asked after his father had gazed at the odd collection for several moments in silence I never saw them before Wasn t this your chest Captain Mansfield examined the outside of the box intently apparently more interested in the find than the boys and then said slowly It belonged to an old sailor whom I found in Hong Kong many years ago He was in the last stages of consumption and begged me to bring him to this country I advised him to remain in the hospital for it seemed certain he would die at sea but he persisted and on the fortieth day out we were obliged to give him a sailor s burial The night he died we were doing our best to save the ship she having been partially dismasted in a typhoon and when he asked for me I was needed on deck He sent word by one of the men that I was to keep his chest which I did although it seemed nothing more than a dying man s whim It was probably brought here with my dunnage and I have never thought of it since Now I can fancy what sort of a yarn he wanted to tell me Do you suppose these things refer to buried treasure Nelse asked excitedly remembering what had been read He probably thought he knew where some of the buccaneers had hidden their booty Take ten old sailors together and it is safe to say that five of them believe they can find gold which has been hidden by pirates Is what we read in the newspaper true Gil asked There can be no question about it There have been several reliable histories of these sea robbers written and by looking in an encyclop dia you will learn how fragmentary this article is New Segovia in Honduras was sacked by them Maracaibo and Gibraltar in the Gulf of Venezuela were plundered by the buccaneers under the command of D Ollonois Morgan with two thousand men crossed the Isthmus to lay siege to Panama and destroyed it Coxon ravaged the coast of Peru and I might go on telling of their crimes until next week without finishing the story All this doesn t prove however that your find contains a clew to buried gold But why not try to learn if these things really amount to anything Gil suggested eagerly You have said you didn t care where we went and this would give us a purpose Yes and one involving no end of hard work but if you boys want to make the venture and can decide where this particular spot is located I ll head the Day Dream for the place and give you a chance Nelse and Gil began to express their gratification but the latter s father interrupted them by saying Don t thank me Treasure hunting is very different from what you fancy and one day s work under a tropical sun no matter how promising your clews may be will result in a most intense desire to leave such jobs to other idiots It is time now to get your traps on board for the storm gives promise of clearing away with a favoring wind and the Day Dream will be under way before sunrise Then Captain Mansfield left them and the boys set about obeying his orders by first wrapping the supposed guides to a large amount of wealth carefully in brown paper after which the remainder of the work was quickly accomplished for their minds were so filled by belief in their ability to unearth a pirate s hoard that many things were left behind which under less exciting circumstances would have been thought absolutely indispensable An hour later the two were sitting in a snug corner of the yacht s kitchen talking with the old darky who was de captin ob dis yere place and who rejoiced in the name of Andrew Jackson Washington Storts De skipper am pow ful fond ob loafin roun in de schooner Andy said by way of opening the conversation But this time it s to be a regular cruise Gil replied We re going for gold and unless a regular hurricane strikes us there ll be no shortening of sail until we make a harbor on the coast of Hayti Wha wha wha s dat Andy asked in mingled surprise and alarm and turned suddenly to face the boy It s nothing to be frightened about we re only going to Hayti After pirates gold We shall make a try for it although father don t think the venture will be success Don do it honey don do it Yo neber was dar an yer ain got any call fur to go You ll think we ve had a call when you see what was found in the chest of a sailor who died aboard uncle s ship Nelse said laughingly You se gwine kase ob wha a dead man tole yer and now Andy exhibited every sign of fear Of course a dead man couldn t tell us anything Gil replied impatiently We don t believe in ghosts But yer will honey ef dis yere craft anchors anywhere roun Hayti near the gold wha s got blood on it So you ve heard about treasure being buried there Nelse cried excitedly I se done more n hear bout it chile Ef I should go fur to tell yer all I se seen de berry hair would tumble away frum yer head Tell us about it and we ll risk our hair Gil said coaxingly Yer doesn t know wha you se askin chile I d done gone die dead ef I should splain half I se seen in dat hole ob de debble Does yer hab any idee who s libbin dere The natives of the island I suppose Jes listen to me chillun an den go ashore same s I se gwine fur to do ef de captain sists on headin dis yere schooner to dat place Dere s voudoos roun de coast and the old man looked over his shoulder as he spoke as if believing some horrible punishment would be meted out to him for so much as mentioning the dreaded name What are they Nelse asked surprised at the exhibition of fear Andy looked at the questioner as if in pity because of the ignorance displayed and after a short impressive pause replied solemnly Ef yer doesn know honey Andy Storts ain de one wha s gwine fur to put yer in any trubble Dem as goes to dat ar place ain nebber gwine ter cum back an yer better foller me ashore kase I don hanker arter bein dead As he spoke the old darky began gathering up such of his belongings as were in the galley literally trembling with fear meanwhile and the boys regarded each other in silent amazement until the trampling of feet overhead caused Gil to dart up the narrow companionway An instant later he shouted Come here Nelse The storm has cleared off and we are under way An exclamation of dismay burst from Andy s lips and dropping the articles from his arms he rushed to the deck Illustration Andy rushed to the deck See page The Day Dream was already several miles from her anchorage sending the spray up from her glistening cut water as she glided swiftly with every inch of canvas drawing toward the sea The exhilaration of the sail caused the boys to forget Andy and his fears temporarily and they watched the graceful craft threading her way in and out among the many vessels and steamers now apparently about to be run down by some iron monster and again threatening a saucy tug with a blow of her fore foot Captain Mansfield was standing near the helmsman watching over the safety of his yacht when the old darky approached him in the highest state of excitement I se done gone altered up my mind captin an carn go on dis yere cruise Andy cried forgetting in his terror that he had no right to speak to the master of the schooner under such circumstances Hold your tongue and go back to the galley I ll listen to you when we are outside I se gwine ter be set ashore sah You re going to be thrown overboard if you don t stop that noise and get away from here was the stern reply and fearing present danger rather than that in the future the steward beat an undignified retreat but at the same time firmly resolved he would not allow himself to be carried to sea in the Day Dream Gil and Nelse had heard the short conversation but there were so many things to occupy their attention that they dismissed it for the time being as something too trivial to require a second thought And each moment the Day Dream was drawing nearer and nearer to the entrance of the harbor The wind was favoring and Captain Mansfield true to the instincts which had animated him while in command of a ship thought only of showing his celerity in leaving port Down through the narrows the little craft speeded leaving behind a wake of silver to show her course and from there to the lower bay still holding the wind at its best drawing point until she was finally bowing and courtesying to the long swell of the Atlantic while in the galley old Andy remained on his bended knees praying that stress of weather might force her into some port before reaching Hayti at which he could make his escape from the terrible dangers which he firmly believed threatened all who should attempt to recover the buried treasure which had been gained only by the shedding of blood CHAPTER III A MESSAGE It is not to be supposed that the boys escaped a severe attack of seasickness when the Day Dream was tossing about on the Atlantic swell Both had indulged in a certain amount of yachting in the river and sound but the violent leaps and plunges of the schooner were something so entirely different from what they had been accustomed to that all power of resistance was lost immediately giddiness and nausea seized their victims Therefore it was that the first two days out were not particularly enjoyed by the boys but at the expiration of that time even the suggestion of fried salt pork failed to disturb them and once more they were in a condition to speculate upon the possibility of finding a buried treasure That old Andy had not succeeded in going ashore they knew because of having seen him several times but his fears had not been allayed as could be told by the expression on his face He had the appearance of one who fancies he is menaced by a sudden and immediate danger and glanced from time to time over his shoulder looking as Nelse expressed it as if he believed half a dozen pirates were trying to sneak up on him Half an hour after their first appearance on deck since the yacht left Sandy Hook the boys paid the cook a visit and hardly were they inside the galley when he broached the subject uppermost in his mind by asking Has you se done gone tole de captin bout wha s gwine ter happen ef dis yere schooner fools roun de shore ob Hayti We haven t done much of anything else than attend to our stomachs for the last two days Andy Gil replied with a laugh Why don t you speak to him about it I se had ernough ob dat kin ob work De night we done lef port I tole him as how dis nigger wouldn t stay aboard an by jes de po est kin ob luck dere was a rope s end handy fur him to grab Andy rubbed his back thus preventing any necessity for further disclosures and the boys laughed heartily thereby causing the old man to lose his temper Dere ain no fun in dem tings an de captin s gwine ter fin out de se rus side ob life ef he keeps dis yere craf headed like she am now It s foolish for you to trouble your head about what we may find in Hayti Nelse replied earnestly for even in case we should touch at the very spot where these voudoos hang out you needn t go ashore Dey kin cum at yer anywhere Andy said with an ominous shake of the head and then he turned so suddenly in order to look over his shoulder lest the phantoms of the pirates should be pursuing him that he nearly toppled headlong As a matter of course the boys enjoyed this hugely and their mirth only served to kindle his wrath anew He closed his thick lips tightly as if to say he would not allow himself to be coaxed into speaking again and Gil was on the point of trying to soothe him when a shout from above caused him to remain silent The captain says the boys are to come on deck and see what we have picked up Gil and Nelse obeyed hurriedly and were not a little surprised at seeing nothing more than a dead bird lying on the main hatch Did you shoot it Gil cried in surprise wondering how it happened that they had not heard the report of firearms It was dead floating and we picked it up Captain Mansfield replied What for I saw something red had been tied under the poor thing s wing and wanted to find out what it meant By doing so we shall be able to rescue several unfortunate men from considerable suffering if not death What do you mean Gil asked in astonishment and in reply his father held up a small piece of brown paper This was what we found wrapped in a tarred cloth with a bit of red flannel to attract attention The cord was a piece of gut which has swelled until the messenger choked to death Gil took the paper almost reverentially and as Nelse looked over his shoulder read the following Shipwrecked men on Walker Key at the northern slope of Little Bahama Banks dying from thirst This message from the sea brought by a bird and discovered only by the merest chance caused the boys the most intense astonishment and Gil asked breathlessly Do you believe it can be true father People do not do such things for sport It must have cost them considerable labor and ingenuity to catch this gull and if they are yet alive we ll soon relieve their sufferings Are you heading for there now Yes and it is very nearly a true course for us We had only to shift the helm a couple of points When shall we arrive To morrow noon if this wind holds Go into the cabin and by looking at the chart which is spread out on the table you will learn exactly where the sufferers were when this gull was set free The boys went below after looking once more at the bird which had performed its mission even in death and then it was not difficult to ascertain very nearly the position of the schooner for the course had been traced in pencil on the chart up to that morning We can t be delayed very long Gil said after they had gratified their curiosity for if the men are yet alive they ll be ready to leave the key at a moment s notice but I suppose it will be necessary to put them ashore somewhere before we go to Hayti You are talking as if we knew exactly where to find the place marked out on the paper we found Well don t we I wouldn t like to say that I do It doesn t seem as if there could be any question about it The piece of newspaper referred to what had taken place on the Tortuga de Mar and the fragment of chart showed that island Yes and a portion of Hayti as well But the drawing represents a small body of land Look at it again and you ll see that only a part has been shown How do you know it does not represent the end of some other key The newspaper shows that I don t think so Nelse replied firmly What we read was the story of how buccaneering first came about and of course it was necessary to speak of the small key where it had its birth If that was its only use why did the owner of the things we found keep it so carefully Probably to show his shipmates that at least a portion of his story was true Until this moment Gil had had but little time to speculate upon the supposed treasure owing to the fact of his having been taken sick so soon after the discovery in the attic was made and now a very unpleasant doubt came into his mind It no longer seemed such an easy matter to find the place designated and he began to fear the treasure hunting would be brought to an end before it had really commenced I shall believe the Tortuga de Mar is the place until we have searched over it pretty well Gil said after a long pause Then if nothing is found we ll say the drawing must refer to some spot on the island of Hayti But what about the voudoos which are causing Andy so much alarm What s that a voice asked from the companionway and an instant later Captain Mansfield was in the cabin Where did you boys ever hear anything about voudoos Andy says they ll kill us if we attempt so much as to anchor near where any pirate hoard is supposed to be hidden Gil replied with a laugh So that is why he insists on being put ashore the captain said half to himself Is there any real reason why he should be afraid Nelse asked Certainly not It is true that there are a large number of negroes more especially in Hayti who believe in that sort of mummery but you can hunt for the treasure just as long as you please without fear of being molested by any of them And you are willing we should make the attempt Dig away as much as you please but I fancy a couple of days work will give you all the searching that s needed Will you help us find the spot as shown by the drawing I ll spend a short time at it providing we have safe anchorage for the schooner This was even more than Gil had dared to hope and his spirits revived wonderfully Then we shan t have any trouble in bringing away a lot of gold he cried and from that moment until it was time to retire save when they were eating he and Nelse studied the tracing on the piece of brown paper When the boys turned in the wind was blowing steadily from the same quarter as when the message from the shipwrecked ones was received and there appeared to be no doubt but that the Day Dream would make the key at the time set by Captain Mansfield Even the idea of the treasure did not prevent the boys from thinking very much of the sufferers whom they hoped to be able to relieve and on awakening next morning the first question was as to whether the necessary rate of speed had been maintained We ll be there on time Captain Mansfield replied cheerily Before twelve o clock we shall have performed a good deed at the expense of but little trouble or have the satisfaction of knowing we did all that was possible under the circumstances Old Andy seemed to have resolved that he would find cause for fear in everything which happened We se gwine straight to de debble he grumbled when the boys spoke with him about the shipwrecked men Dere s no use ter try an make me tink a bird knowed enuf after he was dead to float alongside dis yere schooner so s we could get de writin kase it don stan to reason That part of it was chance of course Gil replied and I can t see that there is anything strange in the men doing all they could to attract attention Wha men Those who have been shipwrecked Dere s sumfin wrong bout de whole bizness kase where s de sailor man what kin ketch a gull I se tellin you honey dat de voudoos hab foun out whar we was gwine an am beginnin to He did not have an opportunity to finish the sentence for at this point the boys literally roared with laughter and he turned away indignantly refusing to speak again until some one from the deck shouted The key is in sight If you boys want to get the first glimpse of the shipwrecked sailors it is time you were tumbling up here CHAPTER IV THE CASTAWAYS Gil and Nelse who had expected to see an island of fair proportions were considerably disappointed on reaching the deck at the scene before them A long low stretch of sand hardly rising above the level of the ocean could be distinguished directly ahead and was about as uninviting a place as one could find Toward the eastward the surf broke with considerable violence and this it was rather than the key itself which attracted attention to the spot Already preparations were being made to lower one of the boats and Gil asked his father How near can we go to land It isn t safe to venture very far across It is all shoal water to the westward of us and I shall hold the schooner off about a mile Do you see any signs of them The smoke is enough to show they re keeping a pretty sharp lookout and Captain Mansfield pointed to a thin thread of blue which had been unnoticed by the boys until this moment That is a signal which they started the moment we hove in sight but it s dying down now we ve shown our intention of running toward them Ten minutes later the boys could distinguish by aid of the glass a number of figures on the beach and Nelse said with a laugh Andy will be more certain than ever that the voudoos have had a hand in this business when he finds out how many extra men he is obliged to cook for It looks to me as if there were at least a dozen Fully as many as that Captain Mansfield added and we shall be crowded uncomfortably for a while but fortunately Nassau isn t so far away that we need worry very much about lack of room At this moment the old darkey came on deck and Gil shouted There s a whole crowd of them The voudoos have sent us lots of company Andy looked from the captain to the key in a sort of bewilderment and one of the sailors who stood near him said You ll have your hands full now cookee for we re likely to add twelve or fifteen to this schooner s crew Andy raised his arms above his head as if in despair and then turning suddenly ran below to the galley from which place he did not emerge again until it was time to serve dinner The schooner was hove to when it seemed to the boys as if she was a very long distance to the eastward of the key but as a matter of fact she was on the edge of the bank and as near in shore as it was safe to venture One of the small boats was lowered and two sailors rowed toward the shore The mate of the yacht Job Jenkins a young man not more than twenty five years of age was leaning over the rail near where Gil and Nelse stood and after watching the men as they pulled the tender around to the western shore of the key to avoid the heavy breakers he said petulantly I ain t a sayin but what it s our duty to take that crowd off yet it s bound to use up the rest of this day and by sunset there won t be so much as a breath of air stirring Better a calm than a hurricane Gil replied with a smile I m not so sure of that The yacht can hold her own under considerably more than a capful of wind and I had rather see her driving through the worst kind of a smother than lying here with that mob on board Mr Jenkins can you make out any wreckage hereabouts Captain Mansfield asked lowering the glass which he had been using No sir and that is just what has been puzzling me I don t understand how so many could have reached the key without some kind of a craft and if any vessel large enough to carry such a crew had gone ashore within the past three weeks the hull should be held by the sand It has an odd look the captain replied as he walked farther aft to get a view from another point By this time the tender had gained the shore and the shipwrecked party after quarreling among themselves made a rush for the boat At least four trips will be necessary in order to get them all on board Jenkins suggested and Captain Mansfield replied Unless they are in a bad condition which doesn t appear to be the case let them do a portion of the work One man is enough to take the boat back and the strangers can pull out to us Gil and Nelse watched eagerly as the first load approached the yacht and a scrutiny of the newcomers was not at all favorable to them as good specimens of sailors They were a thoroughly disreputable looking set bearing no evidences of hardship and the boys fancied all were more or less under the influence of liquor Well Captain Mansfield said as the first one a bushy whiskered man who appeared to be the leader came over the rail you don t seem to be in as desperate straits as I fancied would be the case when I found the gull So you got the writin eh the man replied with a laugh I thought Johnson was wastin his time when he laid round a couple of days tryin to catch the bird but it has turned out mighty lucky for us after all What vessel are you from Illustration What vessel are you from See page The brig Mary and Jane from Savannah for Nassau with an assorted cargo There must have been a fire in the hold when we left port for we fought it from the second day out until it got the best of us and we had to leave the old hooker Were you the captain Not much He and the mates took the only boat that would swim and left us to shirk for ourselves Do you mean to say that they deserted the crew Captain Mansfield asked watching the man sharply That s jest the size of it My mates and I made shift to get to the key an there we ve been ever since It was some seconds before Gil s father spoke again and the sailor shuffled about uneasily under his searching gaze You said you were without water We haven t had a drop since we landed but a couple of casks of rum come ashore an we ve managed to get along with that Did you scuttle the brig before leaving her There was no chance to do anything of the kind We kept her headed for the key till the fire got the best of us and she was in a light blaze when we saw her last How many are there of you Fourteen all told It ll be snug stowing but we ll run for Nassau and land you as soon as possible and Captain Mansfield turned as if to intimate that the interview was at an end You ll have to take deck passage for there are only four bunks in the forecastle and they are all filled Mr Jenkins said as he motioned the men forward All right Of course we re willin to stand our share of the work the man replied as he slouched along the deck with a swaggering air We ve got crew enough and in a small craft like this you would only be in the way Then the mate gave orders that the sailors should return with the boat and the little craft was headed for the shore once more while the newcomers covertly examined the yacht as if they had a personal interest in her sea going qualities The captain appeared to be so disturbed in mind that neither Gil nor Nelse ventured to ask him any questions relative to the men whom he was taking off the key the boys stood amidships where they could see all that was going on and as Captain Mansfield paced to and fro only stopping now and then to exchange a few words with Mr Jenkins Nelse whispered I don t think your father is any too well pleased at having so many people aboard I m certain he isn t and can t wonder at it They are a tough looking set and could make no end of trouble if they were so disposed By this time the second load had come from the key and were no more prepossessing in appearance than the first arrivals Captain Mansfield questioned them sharply receiving in substance the same replies as from the others and when the boat was headed for the shore again he called Mr Jenkins to him Eager to know what was said Gil motioned Nelse to follow him and the two went aft where the conversation could be overheard What do you think of the story they tell Captain Mansfield asked his mate It isn t reasonable and I believe it has been cooked up for our especial benefit That all the officers of a brig should abandon the crew doesn t sound reasonable I am of the same opinion They have either deserted from their vessel or mischief has been done In case it was nothing more than desertion they would have had a boat The same argument holds good under other and more desperate circumstances Very true sir We may never learn the truth but we can take every precaution against trouble Keep your eyes open Mr Jenkins and don t give them an opportunity to play us any game I will see to it that they haven t much rope aboard this craft the mate replied and then the conversation was interrupted by Andy s announcement that dinner was ready The third boatload had not come off when the boys went into the cabin and there saw the old darky looking thoroughly distressed What s the matter Gil asked while they were waiting for his father to come below Say honey does you know how many ob dese yere sailors am comin aboard Fourteen An am all ob dem gwine ter stay on de yacht There s no other place for them until we can make Nassau Den you hark to wha de ole man am tellin yer and Andy looked cautiously around to make sure no one from the deck could hear him Dis yere cruise am boun ter end in trubble an ef de captain keeps de yacht pinted for Hayti we se nebber gwine ter git back Is this another case of the voudoos Nelse asked with a laugh Now don make fun ob wha de ole man tells yer honey an ef dere s a chance to swade de captin ter turn roun when we strikes Nassau go fur him lively It isn t likely father would put the schooner about simply because of what the voudoos might do and if we should say anything it might only make matters worse At this point Captain Mansfield came below and Andy looking decidedly distressed began to serve the meal CHAPTER V MISCHIEF Mr Jenkins predictions regarding the time necessary to bring the castaways on board and the weather were verified Not until nearly sunset did the little tender make the last trip to the key and by that time the calm was raging There was not air enough stirring to lift the thread of blue at the truck and the atmosphere had suddenly grown so hot as to be almost stifling If Captain Mansfield had reason to distrust those whom he was trying to aid during the first interview he had good proof of their evil natures before the wind sprang up again All the castaways were under the influence of liquor to a greater or less degree and those who came latest must have contrived to bring an additional supply to their companions Andy had prepared a substantial meal which was served on deck and instead of being grateful for the same there was more grumbling than might have been expected from sailors whose only food for many days had been salt horse The bushy whiskered fellow who acted as the leader of the party was particularly aggressive and when Andy had set out a well cooked generous amount of corned beef potatoes and cabbage such a spread as they would not have received anywhere save on a pleasure yacht he asked in a surly tone Is this the kind of stuff you re willin to put afore shipwrecked men It s de same as our own crew gets an I lows as how you se kin make out ef yer berry hungry the cook replied angrily turning to re enter the galley Don t answer me back you black villain or I ll break every bone in your body and the man sprang to his feet with a show of rage I se gwine ter say wha I wants ter Andy replied angrily I se de cook ob dis yere craft an ef yer spectin ter git grub dere ain no call fur yippin Hold your tongue the fellow cried seizing his tin plate of food and hurling it at the old darkey s head Andy dodged the missiles which striking the companionway were scattered over the clean deck and the infuriated man ran toward him with the evident purpose of inflicting bodily injury It so chanced that Captain Mansfield came from the cabin at the same instant the plate was thrown and before anything more could be done he shouted Hold on there What is the meaning of all this The words were sufficient to cause the man to halt suddenly and turning around he replied in a sullen insolent tone I don t reckon on taking lip from any nigger no matter who he is The cook was still standing in the companionway and going forward quickly the captain asked him what had been said The sailor would have given his version of the affair attempting to prevent the old darky from speaking but Captain Mansfield said sternly Hold your tongue unless you want to be set ashore again and I m not certain I should take the trouble of using the boat Andy gave a truthful account of all that had occurred and concluded by saying as he pointed to the food on the deck Dere it be capt in de same as I send to de cabin By this time all the alleged shipwrecked men had laid aside their plates to gather around the leader standing very near the captain in threatening attitudes and attracted by the noise Mr Jenkins came on deck Captain Mansfield looked squarely in the fellow s face fully half a minute before he said There is your supper You will get no more to night and you are either to eat or throw it overboard In addition you will clean the deck at once The man stood in an attitude of defiance glancing now and then at his companions but making no move toward obeying the orders and Gil s father turning to the mate said Mr Jenkins if my instructions have not been carried out properly at the end of five minutes throw this man overboard Call all hands including the boys if you need assistance Then the captain walked aft again and the castaways began whispering among themselves as if trying to decide whether it would be safe to defy him Gil and Nelse stood near the wheel where they could hear and see everything Both wanted to go forward but the former s father checked them by saying in a low tone Remain where you are unless Mr Jenkins should call in which case you are to obey his orders implicitly The mate was evidently making ready to carry out his instructions All the men save the man who had thrown the food were sent back to the main hatch and the young sailor was looking at his watch in an ominous manner The castaway muttered something which the boys could not understand made a series of gestures to his companions but without receiving any reply and then in a sulky manner began throwing the food overboard Bring a swab here Mr Jenkins called to one of the crew and the shipwrecked man used it vigorously until the stains had been removed from the white planks Now where am I to get my supper the fellow asked sullenly We don t serve two meals at the same time on board this craft and in case you want to be carried to Nassau I advise that you keep a civil tongue in your head for the captain is no fresh water sailor to allow an old barnacle like you to back him down Then the mate walked aft and the rescued party began to discuss the situation in whispers That s a fine crowd to ask honest sailors for assistance Mr Jenkins said in a low tone when he stood by Captain Mansfield s side If this calm lasts very long we are bound to have trouble with them Keep your weather eye lifting and they can t do much mischief They are all a little the worse for liquor now but when that wears off things will straighten out It would be serving the whole boiling lot right to set em ashore That would be inhuman and besides neither you nor I care to say that we re afraid of a lot of sailors You would be warranted in trying to avoid trouble more especially when there are so many aboard We won t discuss the matter any further Mr Jenkins Keep them well under your eye and we ll soon run down this bank Both Gil and Nelse understood that the captain as well as his mate felt a trifle uneasy because of the strangers who outnumbered the available force of the yacht more than two to one but forcing them to return to the key was not to be thought of for a single moment and it only remained for the officers to be on the alert Owing to the heat and possibly because of the alleged shipwrecked mariners the boys found it impossible to close their eyes in slumber at a very early hour on this particular night Before retiring Nelse had proposed that they pay Andy a visit but Gil objected on the score that it would only be to hear his croaking relative to the visit to Hayti and feeling decidedly disturbed in mind because of other reasons time spent in the galley promised but little pleasure When the boys went below the rescued party were stretched out amidships more comfortable there than they would have been below and so far as could be judged by their respective positions intent only on seeking repose Two hours later after Gil and Nelse had tossed and turned in their bunks unable to sleep because of the almost stifling heat the latter said Let s go on deck There s no chance we shall close our eyes to night if these mosquitoes continue so industrious and we may as well be where it is possible to get the benefit of whatever air is stirring I m ready to go but we must move softly in case father happens to be asleep Because of this caution the two gained the deck in nearly perfect silence and the night was so dark that they could not be seen by those who might be on watch save from a very short distance On the starboard side aft Mr Jenkins was pacing to and fro the sound of his footsteps alone disturbing the silence and from the other side came a subdued murmur which told that the strangers were yet engaged in conversation Without knowing exactly why he did so Gil led his cousin forward until it was possible to distinguish what the rescued men were talking about and then that which he heard was sufficient to attract his closest attention The bushy whiskered fellow appeared to be the chief speaker and he said just as the boys drew near There are only five counting the skipper and mate The cook and the cubs don t amount to anything This yacht is a clipper and with her we could soon find a market for what has been left on the key Don t you think we ve done enough already a voice asked Yes if all hands have turned cowards We shall not get any deeper in the mud by taking what has come to us and with a craft like this everything is possible I wouldn t want a better berth than to sail such a schooner around the keys stopping whenever we wanted two or three days ashore and going wherever we took a fancy You know what that means the same voice said Supposin I do haven t we done the same thing already We can go ashore at Nassau and then it may be a good many months before we dare take what we ve earned I m for making the most of a good chance But how can it be fixed Come nearer an I ll tell you there s no need of yelling when there are so many to hear The doubter moved across the deck and Gil pressed his companion s arm in token that they should retire There s no need of listening to anything more Gil said when they were so near the wheel that there was no danger the words would be overheard Those fellows are plotting mutiny and it is necessary father should know it Why not speak with Mr Jenkins Nelse whispered Then we would be obliged to repeat the story twice Come below Nelse followed without further remonstrance and a few moments later Captain Mansfield had learned sufficient to convince him that his guests were not the most honest people in the world Are you certain no mistake has been made he asked when Gil concluded the narrative We heard everything very distinctly and I am positive the words have been repeated correctly Call Mr Jenkins but do not let any one hear you and Captain Mansfield sprang from his berth as Gil went toward the companion way CHAPTER VI MUTINY To find the mate and tell him he was wanted in the cabin did not occupy many moments and the rescued party who had turned mutineers almost at the same moment their appeal for help had been answered apparently paid no attention to the boy s movements Captain Mansfield repeated to Mr Jenkins what Gil told him when the two were alone and the companion hatch drawn to prevent the possibility of the conversation being overheard and the expression which came over the mate s face showed how serious he believed was the situation I am not surprised he said thoughtfully After the row with Andy we had good reason to look for anything in the way of rascality What do you propose to do I hardly know Although my opinion has not been asked I should say we had better set them ashore as soon as possible To do that we would be precipitating the trouble and besides I hardly see how it can be done When the first boatload was landed they might refuse to let the tender be brought back even in case they left the schooner willingly It is not going to be an easy matter to enforce obedience while they so far outnumber us What is the look of the weather I think we shall have a fair sailing breeze by midnight Then it will be best to make an attempt to land them at Nassau Arm yourself and we will both remain on duty At the first sign of insubordination use your weapons promptly It could be seen that Mr Jenkins was not pleased with this decision but he was too good a sailor to find fault with the commands of his superior officer He entered his cabin reappeared a moment later with bulging pockets and went toward the companion ladder stopping there only long enough to say You will not be needed on deck captain I ll answer for that crowd until daylight It can do no harm to take excessive precautions more especially when they involve nothing more serious than the loss of sleep If you see the slightest sign of trouble call me The mate went out into the gloom and Captain Mansfield said to the boys There is no particular reason why you should be frightened but at the same time it is well to be prepared for any emergency Keep your revolvers where they can be used at a moment s notice but do not make any move toward using them without an express command from me to that effect Do you think the men will attempt to seize the schooner Gil asked in a tremulous voice Not a bit of it but yet almost anything is possible and that is why I want you to be prepared If we get a good sailing breeze at midnight we shall be in Nassau before those scoundrels can form a plan Then the captain went on deck to have a look around and the boys discussed the question of turning in I don t believe it would be possible for me to close my eyes while knowing those men are ready for mischief and there can be no mistake as to what we heard Nelse said in a whisper Why can t we sit here in the cabin all night Father wouldn t like it and besides if that crowd should see us they would know we had discovered their secret Do you intend to lie down Yes but there is no necessity of undressing and in case anything does happen we shall be ready to do our share Nelse would have preferred to remain on deck but he knew Captain Mansfield would not agree to such a plan therefore he followed his cousin to the tiny room which adjoined the one occupied by Gil s father However uneasy they might be regarding the intention of the alleged shipwrecked crew it was impossible to remain awake very long after lying down and in less than half an hour the two were sleeping soundly They were still in the very heart of slumber land at midnight when the looked for breeze sprang up and therefore remained in ignorance of the fact that the dainty white cloths of the yacht had been spread causing the beautiful little craft to heel coquettishly as with a bone in her teeth she darted over the black waters on a true course for the Northeast Providence Channel She is looking up into it well now Captain Mansfield said in a tone of satisfaction as the Day Dream glided across the waves and we can count on getting rid of our passengers before another sun sets for I believe this wind will continue to freshen until morning when we shall have all she needs to induce her to show her best pace The captain and his mate were standing well aft with a trusty man at the wheel as the schooner gained headway and Mr Jenkins replied in a tone of relief If your predictions are correct sir there ll be little to fear for as yet this crowd are without any plan of action Why don t you go below for a while I believe I will Keep your wits about you and don t hesitate to call me if anything looks wrong As he spoke the captain went to his room and in a comparatively short space of time the sound of his heavy breathing could be heard even by the man at the wheel The mate paced to and fro more than an hour and then fancying he heard a movement among the men who were supposed to be sleeping on deck he went forward to investigate The rescued party appeared to be wrapped in slumber as he made his way among the prostrate forms and blaming himself for being unduly suspicious Mr Jenkins continued on to the forecastle companion way before turning to retrace his steps The sailor who should have been on the lookout was nowhere to be seen and the mate stood for a moment expecting him to come from below when suddenly a hand was clapped over his mouth preventing him from uttering the slightest sound At the same instant he was lifted bodily from his feet and carried to the main hatch where the mutineers had no difficulty in binding and gagging him without any more noise than might have been caused by one of the men turning in his sleep Now that it was too late Jenkins saw the missing sailor lying close beside him unable to move hand or foot and he understood that the castaways had formed a very well considered plan which was already more than half successful It s time now to tackle that fellow at the wheel the leader of the party whispered I ll lounge back there he ll think I m the mate until it is too late to make any disturbance and the minute I get him by the mouth you must close in Why not call up the captain first one of the crowd asked Because then we should have two on hand at the same time and there s no knowing what them boys might succeed in doing The easiest plan is the best and so far you ve got no call to kick at the way I ve managed this business Go ahead I won t say another word until the schooner is in our possession Mr Jenkins struggled hard to make some noise which would serve to alarm the man at the wheel but his bonds and the gag had been tied too skillfully to admit of the slightest movement and he was forced to remain inactive while the mutineers carried out their vile plot to the end In less than five minutes the helmsman was also a prisoner and one of the scoundrels took his station at the wheel but careful not to change the yacht s course in case the captain should chance to be awake watching the tell tale Ten minutes later the leader of the mutineers after ordering his men to creep aft where they would be hidden from view by the deckhouse entered the cabin and knocked lightly on the owner s door What is the matter the captain asked awakening at the first sound Mr Jenkins wants to know if you will come on deck for a moment sir was the whispered reply The wind is freshening and he would like to haul around more to the westward Without waiting for an answer the fellow went on deck but he stood close by the companion way after whispering to the man at the wheel Have that belaying pin ready to knock him down if he doesn t give me a fair chance of cutting off his wind Then the sound of footsteps told that the captain had left his room and twenty seconds later he appeared at the top of the ladder Coming suddenly into the darkness as he had and unsuspicious that the summons was a false one the work of making him a prisoner was exceedingly simple Struggle as he might nothing could be effected for half a dozen of the scoundrels were upon him instantly the leader made the first move and now there was no longer any necessity of preserving such perfect silence Three of you tackle the cook and when that has been done I ll attend to the cubs the leader said in an ordinary tone while Captain Mansfield was being carried to the hatch and laid beside the mate and sailors Its all done and the nigger is lashed in his berth one of the men reported before the prisoners thought sufficient time had elapsed for the villains to reach the forecastle Did he give you any trouble Not a bit but acted as if he expected something of the kind How long will it take you to fix the boys That part of it doesn t amount to anything Bring some rope down and I ll end this business mighty quick Nelse and Gil were sleeping soundly when the mutineers opened the unlocked door Beside them were the revolvers and these the ringleader took possession of as he said to his followers Now truss em up but there s no need of using the gags for they can t do any harm no matter how loud they yell The first intimation the boys had that anything out of the usual course had happened was when the men began roughly to tie their hands and feet and then only a single glance was necessary to tell exactly what had been accomplished Turn them out on deck and we ll make ourselves comfortable here for a while before doing the rest of the work the leader said and as if they had been so many bundles of merchandise Gil and Nelse were conveyed to the main hatch there to be flung roughly down From this time until fully an hour had passed the mutineers paid no attention to their prisoners Two men were all that were needed on deck and the others proceeded to make free with the cabin stores as could be told by the sounds of revelry With sufficient wind to keep the canvas full and drawing the little yacht sped on over the long swells while her rightful crew could not so much as enjoy the poor consolation of conversation CHAPTER VII SET ADRIFT The orgie in the cabin was continued until nearly daylight and during all that long weary time the boys could talk to but not with their companions They were the only ones who had been left ungagged and were free to discuss the matter but without being able to elicit a single answer It isn t hard to fancy how the whole thing has occurred Gil said to Nelse but the question is what do they propose to do with us We shall find out mighty soon I reckon and the part which has the most interest for us is whether they will cut our throats or content themselves with simply making us walk a plank after the fashion of oldtime pirates I counted on finding the buccaneers treasure when we started but I didn t suppose we should find the buccaneers themselves While the boys indulged in this rather mournful style of conversation the other prisoners writhed to and fro in the vain effort to slip their bonds and at each useless attempt Gil would look around wondering if it were not possible to aid them in some way Because we can speak it seems as if we should be able to do something he said after his father had literally exhausted his strength trying to get his hands free I ve read in stories of fellows who could chew ropes apart but I don t know how to set about it That s because such a thing isn t possible Nelse replied very decidedly We can t so much as move and as for getting our heads where it would be possible to bite at the bonds it is simply out of the question After this I shall never believe in those yarns It might be done if I could raise myself sufficiently to get at the ropes That is a great big if under these circumstances and I shall put all those stories down as foolish lies after this night It was as if the desire to aid tired the boys for before this conversation had been continued half an hour both were perspiring profusely while they felt weary although having remained inactive It was a relief for all hands when the golden shafts of light which came over the water proclaimed the rising of the sun and the revelers emerged from the cabin to complete their act of piracy The leader lost no time in acquainting his prisoners with the fate in store for them Coming toward the hatch with unsteady movements which told only too well how his time had been occupied he first ordered that the gags should be removed and then said to Captain Mansfield I low it seems kinder rough for us to turn you out but that s what we ve decided to do an there s no use in kickin up rusty about it Do you mean that we re to be set adrift after doing all we could to relieve your distress the captain asked huskily for the gag had been in his mouth so long that it was difficult to speak with sufficient distinctness to make himself understood That s about the size of it the man replied with a drunken leer There s jest a chance we might get into trouble at Nassau because the Mary and Jane was lost Then you are responsible for the destruction of that craft eh Hold your tongue or you may be askin questions that ll get you into trouble for my mates won t stand any nonsense Then cut your own talk short You have committed a deed which will eventually bring you to the gallows and there is no reason why there should be any delay in finishing the job like the pirates that you are Captain Mansfield said impatiently That s exactly what we re goin to do Search the crowd for fear they may have revolvers with them the man said with an assumption of authority which would have been comical under less desperate circumstances But few moments were required in order to execute this command and when the work was concluded the helpless men had been robbed of everything valuable upon their persons Captain Mansfield no longer attempted to speak it was as if his anger was too great to admit of words but he watched jealously every movement made by his enemies The sun was flooding the sea with a golden radiance when the mutineers lowered one of the boats put into her a small cask of water and some provisions and then stood as if waiting for the rightful crew of the Day Dream to take their departure At such a time resistance would have been worse than useless and when his bonds had been removed the captain said as he walked toward the rail I warn you that the time will come when this high handed proceeding must be atoned for and if you have any regard for your own necks you will give us more of a show for life What do you want now the leader asked with an oath Two boats and something to serve as sails With eight people on board one of these little tenders the first strong puff of wind will send her to the bottom Give us as good a show as you would want for yourselves It s a precious sight better than you deserve was the brutal reply as the helpless ones were hurried over the rail their united weight loading the craft down to the gunwales From the time the gag had been removed until he clambered into the boat old Andy had not spoken but when the painter was cast off and the schooner began to draw away from them his anger burst forth in a torrent of threats and reproaches He called down all manner of curses on the heads of sailors who would turn pirates immediately after having been rescued from such a desolate spot as the key and predicted the result of these high handed proceedings in language so energetic that Captain Mansfield said sharply Be quiet Andy You are doing them no harm and couldn t better our condition if you talked all day I se gwine ter let sich low down trash know wha s ercumin to em They ll know it soon enough without any assistance from you Just now we ve something more important to think about for unless we can make harbor on one of the keys which lie hereabouts before a heavy blow comes on our chances for living will be pretty slim Isn t there any hope we can get our things back Nelse asked ruefully The thieves have even taken my watch I don t fancy we shall see even the smallest portion of our property again the captain replied with what was very like a sigh They will get to fighting among themselves and wreck the little craft before long unless which is not likely a war vessel happens to overhaul them Shall we get out the oars Mr Jenkins asked We should be near Spanish or Powel Key and by rowing to the eastward it ought to be possible to run the land down by sunset You are right and it s to be turn and turn about for all hands Unfortunately only two can work at a time because we have no more oars and the tricks shall be an hour for each man From this moment until nearly nightfall but little conversation was indulged in each occupant of the boat had been robbed of all his effects and this in addition to the outrage was well calculated to make them feel the reverse of cheerful The wind which had so much weight in it at sunrise died away entirely about ten o clock and the heat was most intense Not even the lightest breath of air came off the glassy water and one hour was quite as long as the strongest could remain at the oars At three o clock in the afternoon a well wooded key was seen dead ahead and two hours later the victims of their own charitable act were on shore We will stay here twenty four hours Captain Mansfield said as the boat was pulled up into a narrow cove which extended some distance inland and terminated in a veritable thicket of mangroves Then we ll work our way down the bank in the night when we sha n t be so nearly prostrated by the heat It was a great relief to the boys to be able to stretch their legs on shore and when a spot was cleared that all might lie down without fear of being disturbed by centipedes or similar disagreeable things they began to think the situation was not as grave as it might have been A hearty meal of ship s bread and canned meat was followed by a desire to sleep and the entire party lay down to rest for it was not necessary to stand watch Toward midnight the wind sprang up from the eastward but only to die away again a few hours later and Captain Mansfield said to the mate in a tone of satisfaction as the two arose just as day was breaking If there were any vessels nearby last evening we should get a glimpse of a sail when the sun rises for that breeze must have given them a slant toward this key By swarming up one of the largest trees we can have quite a range of vision and something ought to be heaving in sight before night I ll stand the first trick With nothing else to Hark As the captain spoke a creaking sound was heard and he finished the sentence by saying joyfully It seems that we sha n t have long to wait There is some kind of a craft becalmed within a quarter of a mile of the shore There can be no question about that Shall we hail her It isn t necessary She can t get away until the breeze springs up and we may as well know who we are asking for assistance I am not putting as much faith in my fellow man as I was before our experience of yesterday The two walked down the bank of the cove to the beach where a full view of the seaboard could be had and there waited for the rising sun to show them the newcomer The shaft of radiance soon came out of the sea gilding each crestless wave with a glory of brightness and revealing to the watchers the spars of a jaunty looking schooner so near the land that it seemed as if one could have tossed a pebble on her deck Mr Jenkins stood staring at the little craft in open mouthed astonishment as if doubting the evidence of his own senses until Captain Mansfield pulled him roughly back into the shelter of the foliage as he whispered excitedly It s the Day Dream herself For a moment I thought my eyes were playing me a trick the mate said with a long drawn breath of bewilderment What are we to do Show ourselves Not yet We must form a plan of action for if this calm holds until noon the little craft shall be in our possession again CHAPTER VIII TURNING THE TABLES The first thing to be done was to warn the remainder of the party that the mutineers were close at hand lest some incautious noise might betray the fact of their being on the key and to this end Captain Mansfield hurried to the head of the little cove Old Andy was the only one awake and to him the captain whispered The villains who seized the Day Dream are becalmed within twenty fathoms of the shore See to it that The darky looked up in alarm his eyes seemingly starting from their sockets and he was on the verge of giving vent to a cry of fear when Captain Mansfield seized him by the throat Don t you dare so much as wink or I ll choke the breath out of your body he whispered angrily and the old man sank to his knees the very personification of terror Now listen carefully and see that you do as I tell you See to it that there is no noise made here When the others awake tell them to remain quiet until I return There was no longer any danger that Andy would betray the secret by an incautious move The threat terrified him even more than the knowledge of the mutineers whereabouts and Captain Mansfield retraced his steps to the point where he had left the mate During the short time he had been absent the general condition of affairs on the schooner s deck was changed considerably The mutineers had come from below probably after a night s debauch and the sound of angry conversation told that a quarrel was imminent What has happened the captain asked Mr Jenkins in a whisper I don t know They came out of the cabin a few seconds ago and this row appears to be a continuation of what started below It will be a fortunate happening for us if they get into a fight Possibly the mate replied hesitatingly but I fail to see how it is going to be possible for us to accomplish anything without weapons when that crowd are well armed if they have taken the trouble to search the cabin which I reckon has been done long before this We shall find a way out of it if the calm continues Give me a chance to get over the bow before they know we re in the vicinity and I ll take the risk of their weapons The discussion on the yacht was fast degenerating into a regular row The men were talking so loudly that a reasonably good idea of the condition of affairs could be gained by the listeners Several of the mutineers were insisting on making this particular key a sort of rendezvous and demanding that a certain lot of goods probably something they had saved from the Mary and Jane should be brought here Another faction and among them the leader wanted to run for the Florida Straits in order to remain hidden among the keys until search for the yacht should be abandoned They believed and with good reason that Captain Mansfield would not tamely submit to the loss of his vessel and since the weather had been favorable for navigation in a small boat it was more than probable those who had been dispossessed would succeed in reaching Nassau Greatly to the disappointment of the two concealed among the foliage on shore the men did not come to blows although each instant it seemed as if such would be the case After squabbling for twenty minutes or more the mutineers appeared to have come to some kind of an understanding and a quantity of the cabin stores were brought on deck for breakfast Each one appeared to be his own cook and the wastefulness displayed would have brought tears of vexation to Andy s eyes A tin of beef which one fellow opened was tossed overboard after he had taken out two slices A box of biscuit was left on the house that each might help himself and the greater portion used in firing on a wager at a floating bottle This kind of horseplay came to an end finally and then the half drunken crew began lowering one of the boats It is possible that our opportunity is near at hand Captain Mansfield whispered It looks as if some of them were coming ashore and it is time the rest of our party were ready for action Creep back softly and send them to me Then pole our boat as near the mouth of the cove as is safe By a chance as fortunate and unexpected as had been the coming of the Day Dream all the mutineers but two prepared to go on shore and as nearly as Captain Mansfield could judge each man had armed himself either with a rifle or revolver thus exhausting the supply of weapons on board It will be nothing more than child s play now provided they do not land too near here he whispered to himself and just as the boats pushed off from the schooner Gil and Nelse crept close to the watcher s side Is there any chance of our getting the yacht again the former asked but his father motioned for him to be silent The remainder of the party came up before the mutineers were half a dozen yards from the vessel and a few moments later Captain Mansfield saw to his dismay that the men intended to land directly in front of his hiding place It seemed as if this must be a deathblow to all his plans and the boys mentally braced themselves for the struggle both believed to be at hand The men rowed leisurely singing and laughing evidently fancying themselves the only human beings in the vicinity and the little tender struck the beach not more than a dozen feet from where the anxious ones were concealed The bows of the boats were pulled up on the sand to prevent them from drifting away and then the mutineers pushed straight on into the thicket probably bent on exploring the key to learn if it would serve them as a rendezvous They were making so much noise that the watchers might have conversed in ordinary tones but Captain Mansfield did not take any such chances when he whispered to Gil You and Nelse go back to where Jenkins is waiting with the boat Send him to me and get on board Move cautiously down to the very mouth of the cove and stay there with oars in the rowlocks until you see us push one of these crafts from the shore Then row for the schooner the best you know how This was no time to ask questions and the orders were obeyed instantly Mr Jenkins was but a short distance away and when Gil had repeated his father s instructions the mate hurried off leaving the boys to carry out their part of the programme unaided Father is probably going to try to get hold of the other two boats Gil whispered as he clambered inboard and if the mutineers see us while we are pulling out to the schooner we shall have the chance of learning how it seems to be shot at I d rather receive a pretty serious wound than let those scoundrels go off with the yacht again now there s a possibility of our gaining possession once more Nelse said and by the time he ceased speaking both were in the little craft each with an oar ready to pull at the first signal The voices of the mutineers now sounded from a distance and it was not likely they could have a view of the water because of the intervening foliage but yet Captain Mansfield s party gave no sign of action Ten minutes passed and Gil was beginning to grow alarmed lest his father should wait too long when a light splash of water was heard and one of the tenders shot out from the shore with the two sailors rowing and Andy at the helm Now bend to it Gil whispered hoarsely Watch to see that one doesn t pull the other around for there mustn t be any wild steering The boys were out of the cove just as the captain and Mr Jenkins launched the last boat and all three crafts were dashing over the glassy sea in fine style sending tiny showers of spray up from their bows when a loud yell was heard The two fellows on the schooner had caught a glimpse of the captain s party and were shouting for their friends It s a question of reaching the other side of the yacht before they heave in sight or we may come to grief Gil said grimly as he bent his back to the oar until the ashen blade bent under the vigorous strain Board her over the rail amidships boys Captain Mansfield shouted and glancing around for the merest fraction of time Nelse saw that the sailors were steering for the schooner s bow while the other boat was being sent toward the stern By thus dividing the force the mutineers would be beset both from front and rear while Gil and Nelse created diversion on one side and the struggle could not be long protracted The men on the yacht were yelling at the full strength of their lungs and stood near the bow with handspikes raised ready to fell the first who should attempt to come on board but they could not guard the stern at the same time therefore the captain and mate succeeded in clambering over the rail before the fellows were fully aware of their purpose The boys had just pulled around the Day Dream when the main body of mutineers burst out of the bushes and the shower of bullets which they sent without waiting to take accurate aim did no injury to any one Mr Jenkins had opened the battle by hurling a handspike with such good effect that the taller sailor was knocked over like a ninepin and the other realizing how useless it would be to contend against such odds leaped into the sea swimming for dear life as those on the shore continued to discharge their weapons Keep under the rail as much as possible Captain Mansfield shouted as he set the example by crouching where he could get a view of the shore without exposing too much of his body They can t have any very great amount of ammunition and it isn t likely either of that crowd has got the nerve to swim out here Andy was the only one who did not follow this suggestion instantly The old darky was so elated at the complete turning of the tables that it seemed absolutely necessary to give vent in some way to his joy He danced around the deck in full view of the angry men on shore shouting in a sing song tone Wese done got de bes ob dem villyns Glory to de Lam Wese board de yacht once mo Glory to de Lam Wese gwine Hi yi yi These last exclamations were by no means a portion of his song of triumph but just at that moment a bullet from one of the rifles had grazed the top of his ear causing more pain than a really serious wound would have done and with a howl of terror he flung himself down by Captain Mansfield s side where he alternately moaned and continued to cry Glory to de Lam CHAPTER IX BOUND SOUTH After having fired four or five rounds of ammunition without other effect than the grazing of Andy s ear the mutineers appeared to have grown tired of such useless work and ceased to waste their cartridges The calm was still raging There was not wind enough to have caused any perceptible motion in a feather and those who had taken possession of their own again could not do otherwise than remain idle waiting for that which by filling the white sails would carry them far from their enemies On the shore the mutineers sat watching the schooner unable to do anything toward regaining her and as Jenkins expressed it eating their hearts out with anger because they had been so foolish as to take all the weapons ashore leaving the ship keepers virtually defenseless The man who had been bowled over by a belaying pin recovered consciousness after the firing ceased and with a very disagreeable sensation in his head sat on the main hatch probably wondering what was to become of him Are you going to keep that thing the mate asked of Captain Mansfield pointing over his shoulder with his thumb at the disconsolate looking mutineer Let him swim ashore when there s a chance of our crawling away from this key Why not use him first How do you mean If a breeze should spring up now those fellows on the beach would amuse themselves by making targets of us while we were raising the anchor and making sail I have thought of that but do not see how it is to be avoided Make this fellow do such work as he can with our assistance while we remain under cover Give me the word and I ll guarantee to have the little craft ready for the first cat s paw which comes over the sea and without exposing myself Act as you please Mr Jenkins It is no more than fair that he should do something to repay for the trouble and loss which his crowd have cost us The mate could have asked for no more congenial task and Andy was in an ecstacy of delight as the mutineer was forced to play the part of a barricade for the others At first the man appeared disposed to rebel against doing the work demanded of him but Mr Jenkins said sternly brandishing a belaying pin to give greater emphasis to his words You ought to have a pretty good idea by this time that we shouldn t feel very bad to be obliged to break your head and that s exactly what will happen if you don t step lively It may be well to tell those scoundrels on the beach who it is doing this work otherwise they might put a bullet into your hide The fellow began to realize that his captors were not to be trifled with and very meekly went to the rail where he shouted Hi Mike This crowd have got the drop on me an I m bound to do as they say so don t shoot will yer Why not swim ashore They can t do anything if you only show a little nerve cause we ve got all the shootin irons My leg s about the same as broken an I couldn t swim a stroke Mike was silent for a few seconds and then he asked Is the captain countin on leaving us here You have brought it on yourselves and can be mighty certain that we wouldn t raise a finger to help you now if the whole gang was starving Captain Mansfield shouted from his place of vantage under the rail The mutineers began to understand that a speedy punishment was about to overtake them and the leader cried in a whining tone We ll die for the want of something to drink if you leave us There s little chance the world will be so lucky as to get rid of you I shall notify the authorities at Nassau of your whereabouts as well as of the likelihood that at least a portion of the brig s cargo will be found on Walker Key and I reckon you ll not be left alone very long This acted like a douche of cold water upon the mutineers who were also probably wreckers and they exhibited every symptom of uneasiness It is time for you to go to work Mr Jenkins said to his prisoner Get into the boat with me and we ll pull the schooner s head around so your friends won t have so good a chance to interfere with us while we weigh the anchor but remember that if you attempt to give me the slip I ll split your head open with this and the mate flourished the belaying pin savagely Sheltered from those on the shore by the yacht herself this portion of the task could be done in comparative safety and while one of the sailors payed out on the cable the craft was swung around stern on Then the men managed to rig up the quarter deck awning as a screen without exposing themselves very much and all hands could now work while hidden from view of the angry scoundrels on the shore After this had been done the anchor was weighed and then the two in the boat pulled and tugged at the oars until the Day Dream was fully a mile from the shore This had not been accomplished without some show of remonstrance from the mutineers When the yacht first began to move through the water and they understood what was being done a volley of bullets was discharged at random many finding their way through the canvas screen but finally this useless evidence of rage ceased probably because the ammunition had been exhausted Not until they were beyond range did Mr Jenkins allow his prisoner to cease his efforts and then wiping the perspiration from his face he said Now there is nothing to prevent your going ashore if you feel so disposed Will you let the men pull me in to that point Not much What is to prevent your swimming I couldn t do it even if there were no sharks hereabout as there are sure to be My leg feels as if it was broken You got off cheaply and that s more than can be said for the rest of the gang since they will have to answer to the authorities for what has been done If you don t want to swim get on board for I sha n t give you the chance of stealing one of these boats The man obeyed without another word and once on the schooner he crouched under the rail forward as if anxious to escape observation Meanwhile as soon as the yacht was at a reasonably safe distance from the shore Gil and Nelse went below to learn what the mutineers had done there and the scene which met their gaze was well calculated to fill them with mingled feelings of anger and dismay One would have said that a hundred men had been amusing themselves with trying to see how much mischief could be done in a given length of time The contents of the staterooms were dragged into the cabin where they might be examined leisurely and left lying on the floor Food of all kinds was scattered in every direction and as much wasted as would have served the rightful crew of the yacht for many days We ought to be thankful we have got the Day Dream back in any condition Gil said with a long drawn sigh but it is more than provoking to think we gave that crowd the opportunity of destroying things All the weapons watches and money are gone Nelse added but from what your father said I don t fancy the amount of cash is enough to make them very rich and we ll soon repair damages so it won t pay to mourn a great deal Let s do what we can toward setting things to rights While the boys were engaged in this work Andy was surveying his quarters and if harsh words could have injured the mutineers not one would have been left alive five minutes after he saw the condition of his kitchen They had not spent so much time in the galley as aft but the same scene of wanton destruction met the cook s gaze and he attributed the greater portion of it to the voudoos whose especial domains the boys had threatened to invade Dere s gwine ter be de berry debbil raised on dis yere cruise ef de captain consists in runnin to Hayti he muttered while trying to repair the damage I se done gone boun ter tork ter dem boys ag in kase dey mus know wha s sartin ter happen ef dat pirates gol ain got out ob dere min s During this time those on deck had not been idle Every inch of canvas belonging to the yacht was spread to catch the first breath of air which should come over the sea and the captain and mate amused themselves by watching the mutineers who still remained on the beach as if unable to understand that they had lost the little craft so suddenly There comes what we are waiting for Mr Jenkins said as he pointed toward the west where a faint ruffling of the water into a deeper blue betokened the rising of the wind Now what is to be done with the fellow forward Call him aft and let him decide the question The man obeyed Mr Jenkins summons in a slouchy shamefaced manner touching his hat when he reached the quarter deck and standing there as if expecting punishment was about to be meted out to him We hope to be under way in a short time Captain Mansfield began and you are to say what is to become of your precious self I should be warranted in taking you to Nassau in chains but it will be too much trouble I would like to be set ashore sir You can leave at any time but I don t propose the men shall exert themselves in your behalf by so much as pulling an oar I can t swim the man said piteously That may be but if we row you ashore your precious friends will probably gain possession of the boat considering the fact that they are well armed while we would be helpless I can rig up a sort of raft on which he could manage to reach the land Mr Jenkins ventured to say observing that the captain hesitated Very well if he chooses to go in that manner I have no objection and Captain Mansfield turned away for he was eager to be rid of the mutineer but did not propose to take any risks Two empty casks with a plank from one to the other formed quite a seaworthy raft for one man and ten minutes later just as the oncoming breeze filled the yacht s sails the mutineer was paddling for dear life toward the key There was no time to watch his movements for the Day Dream began to draw away from the land in a manner which told that the run to Nassau would be quickly an accomplished fact providing the wind held Once more the yacht was bound south and despite all the misfortunes which Andy persisted in believing were caused by the voudoos Gil and Nelse allowed themselves to dream again of the pirates gold CHAPTER X HAYTI One could easily fancy how much the mutineers must have been punished by seeing the schooner moving swiftly away from the land knowing as they did that the officers of the law would soon come in search of them and more than one on board the Day Dream was satisfied with this as atonement for all the discomforts suffered during the last thirty hours It was impossible to say whether the fellow who had just been released ever reached the shore although all the chances were in his favor The last that could be seen of him through the glass was when the schooner rounded the point of land which marked the eastern most extremity of the key and then he was paddling for dear life It surely seemed as if the wind had come to stay for some time It continued to increase in weight until nightfall when the yacht had as much as she needed in such waters and Mr Jenkins confidently announced to Gil and Nelse that they would be at Nassau before sunset on the following day Time proved this prediction to be correct By six o clock on the same day the yacht had been recaptured all evidences of her late unlawful crew were wiped out both fore and aft and when the boys retired the thought of their slight losses as compared to what might have been went very far toward consoling them Father will buy us such things as we may need when we get into port Gil said confidently to his cousin and if he doesn t think it necessary to replace our watches no great harm will be done if we are obliged to look at the cabin clock in order to learn when the meals should be served I m not worrying about the stuff those fellows took from us Nelse replied but am only afraid uncle won t allow us to hunt for the treasure because of what has already happened That will be all right as you will see so let s try not to think any more of what has happened At noon on the following day the boys almost forgot the disagreeable adventures with the mutineers when they landed at Nassau with Mr Jenkins and made a tour of the sponge yards while Captain Mansfield went to inform the authorities of those whom he believed were responsible for the loss of the Mary and Jane It was a particularly pleasant day which they spent ashore viewing the many wonders wrested from the bed of the ocean and on returning to the schooner neither thought to ask what had been done until Captain Mansfield was speaking with the mate about the officers of the ill fated brig There can be no question but that those fellows had a hand in the wrecking of the Mary and Jane he said The captain and mates landed here last week and told me to day there could be no doubt as to the facts On three different occasions it was found that the brig was many points off her course and I fancy the men knew exactly where she would be foundered Will the authorities send to arrest them Gil asked Certainly and the officers of the brig intend to urge it besides they propose to start at once for Walker Key in the hope that some of the cargo may be there Were the men really deserted Not a bit of it according to the captain s story and after what we have experienced I would believe him against a thousand such as tried to run away with the schooner It seems that when the brig struck the men were ordered into the boats but they refused to leave until the spirits had been divided The crowd we met insisted on using the gig and holding her fast alongside proceeded to get drunk A heavy sea was running and after the officers had expostulated with the men for some time they believed there was nothing left but to look out for their own lives The vessel was fast breaking up and the crew in a drunken condition when the captain s party finally put off to try to reach this port which they did in four days A schooner was sent out from here but nothing could be found either of the crew or of the craft and it was generally believed that she slid off into deep water and sank Now what will happen Gil asked I think it is safe to say the fellows will find themselves in a very disagreeable position before many days have elapsed Captain Mansfield replied and then he was summoned on deck by the arrival of the goods which he had purchased to replace those stolen by the mutineers From this time until they were ready to turn in the boys had plenty to occupy their attention The new weapons additional stores and such other articles as the captain had bought were inspected The things were stowed in their proper places and then once more the question as to whether the treasure could be found came up for discussion Not until a very late hour were the boys ready to retire owing to the many exciting topics of conversation and both were awakened next morning at sunrise by Mr Jenkins who said cheerily Turn out lively lads for there is a good deal to be seen from here until we are well through the channel and the yacht is already under way When they came on deck the Day Dream was opposite the southernmost point of Great Abaco Island and the singular formation of rock known as the Hole in the Wall was in full view The schooner was gliding slowly along under the influence of the gentle morning breeze and Gil and Nelse had a good opportunity of seeing the odd sights foremost among which was Spanish Wells the name of the town on St George s Key at the extreme northwest point of the Island of Eleuthera where the houses are built on raised platforms like many in the Malay Archipelago The mate explained that this singular style of architecture was adopted because of the hermit crabs which sometimes come ashore in vast numbers ravaging the land and entering every building not on stilts Then the cocoanut groves two miles farther along the coast were seen the flame colored and scarlet blossoms serving to form a most gorgeous picture A hasty breakfast and the boys were on deck again to see the Glass Window a curious and perfect arch of limestone eighty five feet above the surface of the sea Not many years ago so Mr Jenkins said a pleasure party were dining there when suddenly a great tidal wave came rushing in from the ocean dashed up under the arch and swept the greater number of the merry makers away Such waves coming without the slightest warning are frequent here The natives call them rages and believe they are caused by storms some distance off on the Atlantic Still farther down the coast is New Gregory s Harbor where the wonderful cave extending more than eleven hundred feet under the ground is located but of course this could not be seen from the schooner There were in fact so many wonderful things to attract the curious during this run down the chain of islands that the boys actually grew tired of the variety and in sheer weariness turned their attention to what both seemed to think was the true purpose of the voyage Will it be many days before we arrive at Hayti Gil asked the mate and the latter replied If the wind favors we shall wind this portion of the cruise up in short order The captain intends to run down as far as Silver Key Passage and then we can head nearly due west Let s go and tell Andy how near we are to the home of the voudoos Nelse suggested and the two went at once to the galley where the information was imparted without loss of time The old darky looked at them pityingly for some seconds and then shaking his head mournfully he said You se rushin on ter destruction dat s wha you se doin an when de time cums dat dere s no help fur you I se sartin nobuddy won t call Andy Storts er fool What are you going to do when we land Gil asked trying hard to prevent himself from laughing I se done gone range up a plan ob my own And decided not to desert us Dere s no kin ob use tryin ter run away frum de debbil kase it carn t be did Ef de captain s boun fur ter git hisself in trubble an you boys won t try ter dissuade him from it I se gwine ter take keer ob myself Don dat stan to reason You are right Andy Nelse replied laughingly but please tell us what your plan is It carn t be did honey kase de voudoos wud git hol ob it an den whar d de ole man be I se bin studyin an studyin sence we got de schooner back an now I se feelin toller bly easy in my min Then by not telling us the secret you show yourself willing that we shall come to grief Honey dem as rushes roun whar dey don b long mus take de chances an ole Andy couldn t dissuade yer ter took his adwise With this sage remark spoken in the most sepulchral of tones the cook turned his attention once more to the savory dish he was preparing for the cabin table and it was all in vain that the boys tried to prolong the conversation From this time until the schooner finally came to anchor off the northern shore of the Tortuga de Mar nothing of especial interest occurred to vary the monotony of the voyage The wind favored them in the most satisfactory manner and the little craft glided among the many keys in perfect safety until on a certain night about ten o clock the longed for spot was reached The boys had been on deck in a perfect fever of excitement during the entire day but owing to the darkness it was impossible to gain any idea of the small body of land where they believed so much treasure would be found by them We must curb our impatience until morning I suppose Gil said with a sigh but I would have liked a chance to compare the conformation of the land with our chart Are you going to bed now Nelse asked What would be the use I couldn t close my eyes in sleep yet awhile Then let s slip into the galley and see if Andy is putting his wonderful plan into operation I am eager to find out how he proposes to assure his own safety while the debbil is getting hold of us Gil was more than willing to act upon this suggestion since it would serve to help pass away the time until they wished to turn in and the two went below to the kitchen where to their great surprise the door was found securely locked They knocked again and again without receiving a reply and as one of the sailors passed Gil asked Do you know where Andy is In there and he don t mean to open the door for anybody I reckon he s up to some of his funny business cause he s so afraid of what may be found on the island The boys tried again to make the old darky answer but he steadily refused and they were finally forced to return to the deck CHAPTER XI CONJECTURES During this evening Gil and Nelse could do no more than speculate as to whether it would be possible to find a conformation of the coast similar to the one shown by the rude chart and since this question was to be settled definitely in such a comparatively short space of time neither Captain Mansfield nor Mr Jenkins would so much as take part in the conversation Even the exciting thoughts of discovering pirates treasure were not sufficient to prevent them from feeling sleepy after a while more especially when all save the watch had turned in and at midnight they crept into the little stateroom Both the boys lay down with the determination to be on deck at the first sign of dawn and yet the sun was half an hour high before either opened his eyes Nelse was the first to awaken and he cried in a tone of deepest anxiety as if believing the delay might in some manner result to their injury Get up Gil If this is the way we set about hunting for gold there won t be a very good chance of finding any We should have been on deck two hours ago This summons was sufficient to bring Gil to his feet instantly and after a hurried toilet the two were leaning over the rail aft with the well worn and enigmatical piece of brown paper spread out where it could be studied at their leisure When they first gained the deck Andy was coming from the galley to the cabin with the morning meal but both the would be treasure seekers were in such a high state of excitement that they actually forgot their curiosity of the previous night and did not even think to ask what steps he had taken to insure his safety against the dreaded voudoos If that was intended as a chart of the Tortuga de Mar the schooner is in the best possible place for you to go ahead with the work Mr Jenkins said as he approached the boys There s the point of land with a rock or bit of coral to the nor ard of it an dead as the bowsprit shows is the cove with what I take to be soundings but have you fellows figured out the meaning of the other things We think the drawing of the schooner with a lead line on which is the figure eight hanging from her bowsprit means that only a small craft with a draught of not over eight feet can get in there Gil replied I reckon that s right though it was a waste of time an lead pencil to make the craft after showing the soundings Then the letters and figures on this stick and the straight lines on the side refer to the same thing which is that from a certain tree for those scratches must have been made to represent foliage at a distance of eighteen feet and eight inches north then five feet west the treasure will be found Well you ve figured it out better than I expected Mr Jenkins said approvingly but how do you know whether the measurements are in feet yards or fathoms That part of it is guesswork of course I don t think it can mean fathoms because of the fraction eight therefore it will only be necessary to try the feet and yards which can t be such a great amount of work No the mate replied slowly and thoughtfully not if this is the place or if you find the right tree or if there s any treasure buried on the island but according to my way of thinking it ll be a decently hard job to decide exactly where the sights should be taken from considering the fact that this part of the island is fairly well wooded Then Mr Jenkins walked away for the cook had announced that breakfast was served and the boys were again plunged into a disagreeable state of uncertainty because of the difficulty they would undoubtedly have in trying to decide which was the landmark referred to on the supposed chart Andy did not so much as look at Gil and Nelse when they came into the cabin It seemed as if he tried to avoid meeting their eyes and during all the time they were talking with Captain Mansfield relative to the finding of the tree he stood just inside the pantry making some of the most extraordinary gestures possible There is nothing to prevent your going ashore with Mr Jenkins if you feel so disposed Gil s father said as he finished his meal I am not inclined to any such exercise but can manage to pass the time with some degree of comfort while the search is made The boys had hoped the captain would become interested in the proposed work when they were where an investigation could be made but this last remark showed that he did not intend to have anything to do with the decidedly mythical treasure Mr Jenkins however was not only ready but eager for a trip ashore and without waiting for orders he caused one of the tenders to be lowered If there were any inhabitants on this end of the island they had kept well out of sight and to guard against a possible attack by wild animals the boys armed themselves with revolvers as well as rifles There was plenty of work aboard for the sailors therefore the treasure seekers were expected to do their own rowing and with all hands except Andy watching from the rail they started heading directly for the cove Gil suggested that in order to make certain the narrow strip of water was the one they were anxious to find soundings be made If the depth of water should coincide with the fifteen ten and eight of the chart it would afford a certain degree of proof but to this Mr Jenkins objected It would be only a waste of time he said The bottom so near inshore shifts every year and you couldn t even rely on a Government chart I thought from what we read in the newspaper clipping that the island was small Nelse said as the boat neared the shore It looks pretty big from here Twenty two miles long and five wide according to the geographies the mate replied with a laugh so you see there s plenty of room for adventure in case Andy s voudoos really make this place their headquarters Do you believe in anything of the kind That the negroes of Hayti practice the rites of voudooism there can be no doubt but of course the cook has exaggerated matters By this time the little tender s bow had been run up on the sandy beach and after looking carefully around to make certain no one was lurking in the vicinity the party landed The boat was made fast and Gil led the way on what now seemed a hopeless task that of finding a tree so old as to give promise of being the one from which the proper bearings might be taken if indeed there was anything proper or positive in the document they had discovered The foliage was dense so matted in places as to render it difficult for the travelers to force a passage through and thus they were obliged to go blindly on passing near perhaps the very object for which they were searching There were many birds to be seen and heard but no other form of animal life was found during the tramp except once when a hog probably a descendant from those brought to the island by the original buccaneers dashed out of the thicket almost overturning Nelse and disappearing again before either of the party had an opportunity to fire a single shot At the end of an hour when they were three miles from the beach as nearly as could be judged the mate threw himself on the ground as he said impatiently It is foolish to keep on in this manner We haven t come across a tree of any size after walking this distance although we know there were very many to be seen in the immediate vicinity from the schooner s deck The undergrowth is so dense that we shouldn t know it if one was a dozen feet away Nelse replied fanning himself vigorously for the heat at this point where the cooling breezes from the sea could not penetrate was almost stifling Then there s all the more reason why we should go back mark out a course and follow it by a compass But I counted on finding what we wanted straight across from the end of the cove Gil said disconsolately It isn t yet certain that it can t be discovered the mate replied laughingly We are not woodsmen enough to travel a beeline without anything to guide us It s positive we re wasting time roaming around in this manner so let s go back Hold on a little while I am so nearly roasted that there will be nothing left of me but perspiration if I am forced to take any exercise right away Nelse cried in affected distress Each member of the party was more than willing to indulge in a siesta just at this time and following the example set by the mate the boys stretched themselves out at full length regardless alike of snakes or the worshipers of voudoo Everything was conducive to slumber save the winged pests which were particularly active and despite even these all three were soon sleeping soundly so much so in fact that two half naked negroes passed within three feet of where they were lying without arousing them This was possible owing to the fact that the strangers walked with exceeding caution finding an open way through the foliage where seemingly none existed and circling around the sleepers without so much as a rustling of the leaves These men must certainly have been aware that the schooner had come to an anchor off the island during the night for they evinced no surprise at seeing the whites but scrutinized them carefully as if trying to judge of their character For fully five minutes the fellows continued the silent examination and then they glided through the thicket toward the direction where the yacht was lying A quarter of an hour later Mr Jenkins awakened and called cheerily to the boys Come it s time to turn out if we want to get back without running the risk of losing our way When the sun gets behind the trees we shall be all at sea so far as direction goes The short nap had refreshed the boys wonderfully and they were on their feet at once ready for the tramp Father will laugh when we tell him that after being on shore so long we haven t seen the kind of a tree we were searching for You may have better luck to morrow the mate said cheerily as he led the return march and the little party traveled so rapidly that in a trifle more than an hour they were pulling toward the Day Dream from the cove all unconscious of the half a dozen black forms concealed in the thicket near the water s edge watching their every movement CHAPTER XII A STRANGE SPECTACLE Although Andy had paid no attention to the departure of the boys and the mate he was watching eagerly for their return and Gil said laughingly as he saw the old darky s woolly pate just outside the forward companionway hatch I suppose he thought we would never come back that the voudoos were sure to catch us We must ask him how it is he feels secure now when a short time ago he was confident we should not live to get home again He has probably conjured up some kind of a charm the mate replied as he leaped aboard the yacht painter in hand and at that instant the cook disappeared very suddenly Captain Mansfield was taking his ease under the awning aft when the boys came over the rail and from the expression on their faces he knew the forenoon s work had produced no satisfactory results Treasure hunting in such a climate isn t what it is cracked up to be eh he cried We haven t found what we wanted yet but we may be more successful to morrow Gil said just a trifle sheepishly Take your time about it but let me know when you begin to grow discouraged for this isn t the safest anchorage I have seen in case the wind comes from any northerly quarter It really seemed as if Mr Jenkins had been seized with an attack of the treasure hunting fever for without waiting to eat dinner which was already prepared he produced his glass and began searching the thicket Are you looking for an old tree Nelse asked Yes we may as well get our bearings at once and save just so much time to morrow morning Do you see any No less than three I ll mark out a course to each and neither of them are so far from the shore but that we can visit all in half a day At this moment Andy came from the galley on his way to the after pantry and motioning to Gil to do the same Nelse followed him Well you see we went on shore and escaped being devoured by the voudoos he said when all three entered the cabin Don t say nuffin bout it honey the cook whispered imploringly Dis yere schooner ain t outer de reach ob dem debbils till she s boun home Tell us what you did to protect yourself Gil asked We tried to get into the galley last night in order to learn the same thing but you wouldn t open the door You se crazy chile ter tork so loud when we se in dis yere place I couldn t tole yer nuffin bout it kase den de charm would spile Ef yer don go ashore ag in there s er chance ob gittin off wid our lives Then it is a charm you ve got Nelse cried gleefully Let us see it Andy I se done gone bliged to keep cl ar ob you chillun ef dar s any mo said bout it the cook replied angrily We se in a mighty bad scrape an I se got my han s full takin keer ob Andy Storts widout tryin fur ter bring mo trubble by torkin This ended the conversation so far as the old darky was concerned for after placing certain additional dishes on the table he betook himself to the seclusion of his galley Mr Jenkins could apparently think of nothing but the supposed treasure and during a greater portion of the remainder of the day he pored over the rude chart discussing with the boys the possibility that it might refer to some other island Andy took great pains to stay out of the way all this time and they saw nothing of him until supper was served but even then he refused to speak That evening Gil and Nelse slung hammocks under the awning intending to sleep on deck because of the excessive heat which rendered the cabin suffocatingly close and the mate ensconced himself in a folding chair which could be stretched out in the semblance of a bed It was nine o clock Save for the low musical murmur of the sea on the sandy beach not a sound could be heard and the boys were fast sinking into the arms of the dream god when Mr Jenkins whispered excitedly Look there I reckon there s considerable in Andy s yarn about voudoos This was sufficient to cause the boys to leap from their hammocks very suddenly and gazing in the direction pointed out by the mate they saw nothing more remarkable than the glow of a fire about half a mile to the eastward of where they had landed during the forenoon There s not much startling about that Gil said in a tone of disappointment It shows there are human beings ashore near here although we failed to find any traces of them But it doesn t prove that they are other than honest fishermen or planters Nelse added I m not so sure Mr Jenkins replied in a musing tone If there was nothing out of the ordinary run going on over there why should a fire have been built It won t take us long to learn Gil cried for his last remark had aroused his curiosity What is to prevent our rowing over that way The tender hasn t been taken out of the water and although we ve had plenty of exercise to day a little more won t do us any harm I m with you if the captain makes no objection the mate said as he sprang to his feet and Gil s father who had overheard the conversation replied Do as you please but don t stay away too long for at this season of the year it is impossible to say when a breeze may spring up which would make our anchorage a dangerous one It isn t likely we shall want to land Gil said as he went to the cabin for his and Nelse s revolvers and five minutes later the little party were rowing toward the reflection of the fire Gil and Nelse at the oars and Mr Jenkins steering Be careful the mate had said in a low tone as they left the side of the yacht On such a night as this sound travels a long distance over the water and you don t want to splash about much This admonition was unnecessary The thought that they might be on the brink of some wonderful discovery rendered both the boys cautious and he who could hear anything as the little craft glided toward the shore would need to have a very acute sense of hearing Perhaps half an hour elapsed before they were near that portion of the shore from which the light had been reflected and then it was learned that the blaze was some distance inland It was possible to distinguish voices in an unmusical song or chant but nothing could be seen and Mr Jenkins whispered We might just as well have stayed on the schooner so far as learning anything is concerned Shall we go back or do you boys want to creep up on those fellows It was evident that the mate wished to land but preferred to have it appear as if he was doing so simply to oblige his companions I would like to see what is going on in there Nelse said and Gil added after a moment s thought There can be no harm in trying it Those who are making that noise would hardly dare to raise a row in case we betrayed our whereabouts and besides armed as we are it should be possible to hold our own against quite a crowd The boat s bow was run gently on the sand and Mr Jenkins stepped softly over the side to hold her while the boys got out after which she was carried a full length up on the shore I ll go ahead the mate whispered and you take good care to keep close to me for it would make a bad mess if we should get separated in the darkness Go on we ll take care of that part Gil whispered and the advance was begun slowly for it was no easy matter to make one s way among the dense foliage with the necessary degree of silence As the party advanced the sound of voices became more distinct and finally it became positive that some odd sort of a performance was being given in this wild place When about three hundred yards had been traversed the mate came to a sudden halt and as he pulled aside a cluster of saw palmettos the boys had a full view Instinctively they had crouched to the ground when Mr Jenkins movements told that the journey was ended and screened by the underbrush it seemed positive they were hidden from that strange party The fire had been built in a small cleared space at the foot of a huge palm tree and over the flames was suspended an iron pot from which a most disagreeable odor arose For the time being however the spectators had no thought for anything save the actors in this strange spectacle No less than twenty coal black men naked save for a cloth about the loins were dancing to and fro near the blaze bending their bodies in every possible position and making the hideous noise with greatest energy Now and then one would circle around the pot several times in succession howling yet louder while his companions remained silent and at the end of the dismal song would throw something into the boiling mass after which the uproar increased until another member of the party performed the same ceremony Gil was very positive he saw first a snake and then a toad thrown into the pot and it hardly seemed possible the cooking would be followed by eating The faces of the dancers were painted with vivid red lines as if the coloring matter was blood and two of the eldest members had the same kind of ornamentation covering their entire bodies When the crowd had apparently exhausted themselves by this sort of exercise they crouched around the fire looking more like gigantic frogs than human beings and the old fellows stirred the contents of the pot making the most uncouth gestures meanwhile Then it appeared as if the broth was done The performers began to dance and sing once more and Gil had just thought that it was time for them to retrace their steps when the two highly decorated performers set about ladling the disgusting looking stuff into cocoanut shells A dozen portions were taken from the pot and handed to as many men each of whom immediately started through the thicket in a different direction one passing so near Nelse that it seemed as if he leaped directly over the boy and the remainder of the crowd redoubled their howls and contortions Mr Jenkins pressed the hands of his companions to intimate that it was time for them to leave and the boys rose to their feet following him at a comparatively swift pace to the spot where the boat had been left We must have missed our way somehow the mate whispered when they finally emerged from the thicket and saw no signs of the craft I could almost swear that this is the place where we landed So it is Gil replied in dismay Here is the imprint of her keel in the sand Some of those fellows who left with the soup have stolen her CHAPTER XIII IN TROUBLE Not until Mr Jenkins examined the beach in every direction for a distance of ten or fifteen yards from where they came out of the thicket would he be convinced that the tender had been stolen Then when he saw the imprints of bare feet showing that the thieves had carried the little craft thirty or forty feet toward the eastward before launching her and even found the spot where her bow had rested on the sand probably while the negroes got on board he was almost beside himself with rage I ought to be kicked every hour in the day until we get home again he said angrily Anybody except a fool like me would have had sense enough when those fellows left the fire to realize that the boat might be in danger but I never gave her a thought Neither did Nelse nor I Gil added consequently we rank quite as high in the fool scale There s no way out of it but admit to father that we allowed the tender to be stolen and try to look pleasant when he makes sport of us I wish we were where we could tell him the mate said half to himself That can be easily arranged It will only be necessary to discharge the revolvers three or four times and I guarantee father will send some one ashore to learn if there is any trouble I don t think it would be just safe to do that The crowd we saw back there would most likely prove to be ugly customers if they had any idea we saw their capers and it might not be pleasant to bring them down upon us by reports of the weapons Do you believe they are voudoos Nelse asked in a voice which was not remarkable for its steadiness There can be no question about it But what are they doing I reckon old Andy is the only one of our folks who can answer that question It begins to look as if we had good cause to be afraid Gil said gloomily Not a bit of it the mate replied cheerily We have only to loaf around here two or three hours and then some one will come ashore to look for us The most serious portion of the whole business is that the captain is bound to haul us over the coals for losing the boat and putting him to so much trouble Owing to the darkness and the distance it was not possible to see even the outlines of the yacht but the forlorn party knew in what direction she lay and they seated themselves on the sand just outside the fringe of bushes straining their ears to hear the first sound which should tell that friends were coming Half an hour elapsed Mr Jenkins had just ascertained this fact by looking at his watch when the sound of oars caused all three to leap to their feet in joy Surprise and delight that the time of waiting had been so short prevented them from noticing that the craft was coming from a direction opposite the location of the schooner and as they went to the water s edge Gil hailed Boat ahoy Here we are Our craft was stolen and to save ourselves from possible trouble we didn t try to attract your attention Then he paused for a reply but none came The light splashing of water told that the boat was still approaching and Mr Jenkins cried impatiently Ahoy there Where are you from Now even the sounds of the oars ceased and the little party were so engaged in trying to distinguish the craft amid the gloom that they failed to hear the light patter of naked feet directly behind them It must be Mr Jenkins did not finish the sentence for at that instant he was seized from behind and dragged backward on the sand before he could make the slightest outcry Gil and Nelse were served in the same manner at the same time and when either of the three realized what had happened they were powerless to move or speak Two negroes held each of the prisoners as in bonds of iron while a third covered the captive s mouth with an enormous hand to prevent any outcry The mate attempted to show fight but struggle as he might it was impossible to do more than render his own position painful and this he understood in a very short time The Day Dream s boat which had played such an important part in their capture was now rowed to the shore and from her leaped two other negroes who after assuring themselves that the white strangers had been secured lifted the tender from the water carrying her straight up from the beach When they had disappeared in the thicket the prisoners were raised to their feet and one of the captors who appeared to be the leader of the party spoke harshly in a tongue which neither the mate nor the boys understood From the tone it was easy to guess that he was warning them of the consequences in case they should make any outcry but this seemed superfluous in view of the fact that the black hands were still held firmly over their mouths Half led half dragged the little party was forced through the thicket in the direction from which they had just come and not a word was spoken until all were within the circle of light cast by the fire around which the negroes had been dancing Here the black men held a very lively conversation all talking at the same time and pausing now and then only to examine more closely the prisoners Gil believed they were discussing the question of what should be done with their prizes and this seemed yet more probable when the two highly decorated old men spoke at great length while the others listened all nodding their heads in token of approval when the speeches were brought to a close Meanwhile Mr Jenkins appeared to be more alarmed than were the boys but his fear came from other sources than the present disagreeable situation The soughing of the wind among the trees told to his experienced ear that a breeze was springing up from the northeast and if it increased to no more even than what might be expected at this season of the year he knew it would become necessary for the yacht to put to sea or run down the other side of the island for a harbor In either case they would be left comparatively alone among those who could be considered in no other light than as enemies and the prospect was not cheering The negroes had not yet decided what should be done when the report of a musket was heard in the distance and the prisoners looked at each other meaningly for they knew it was a signal for them to return at once This noise caused the black men to come to a speedy conclusion and after the old fellows had given what were evidently very minute directions as to future movements the fire was extinguished The prisoners guarded as before were marched through the thicket on a course nearly at right angles with the one by which they had come from the beach and had not proceeded more than a quarter of a mile when shouts were heard from the shore Gil Mr Jenkins Shipmates ahoy Captain Mansfield had sent a boat ashore in search of the missing members of his crew and one can fancy some portion of the prisoners mental distress at knowing friends were so near and they unable to make their whereabouts known Again Mr Jenkins attempted to free himself but after receiving several warning pricks from the point of a knife in token of what might follow in case he persisted in fighting he gave up the struggle Again and again did the cries come to their ears borne on the wind which was steadily and rapidly increasing and then another report of a musket told that this last boat had been recalled Gil and Nelse were almost frantic Both realized that the negroes would not have dared to commit such an outrage unless they were so strong in numbers as to resist an attack and the thought of what might be their fate on this island which had already been the scene of so many bloody dramas was ample excuse for any display of weakness or terror The negroes marched rapidly on for at least half an hour and then coming suddenly as if from the very bowels of the earth a bright flame appeared directly in front of the leaders As their eyes became accustomed to the gloom the boys saw that the blaze proceeded from half a dozen torches held by as many men who had come out of what appeared to be a cave in the side of a hill Here quite a lengthy conversation ensued and then the prisoners were led through a passage sufficiently wide for three men to walk abreast to a small cave situated about fifty feet from the opening Further on the glow as of a fire could be seen thus showing that beyond their halting place was another and a larger underground chamber where probably those who had been performing the uncouth antics near the beach found a shelter The prisoners were thrust into the small cave or excavation without ceremony and the others went on apparently indifferent as to what might be done by the whites The place was so dark that no idea could be formed of its size or what it might contain and even if it had been light Mr Jenkins would hardly have given it any attention at that moment He stood near the entrance watching until the men had entered the cave at the end of the passage and then he ran toward the entrance Before he had taken twenty steps a blow from a club brought him to his knees showing that sentinels were on the alert and he crawled back dazed and bleeding from an ugly cut on the head The boys had not followed but they understood from the noise what had happened and aiding their companion to enter the underground prison seated themselves beside him What a fool I was to fancy we were left unguarded the mate said as he felt the warm blood trickling down his face Strike a light Gil and see what condition my head is in Fortunately the boys had a small supply of wax matches and one of these burned long enough to examine the wound A single glance was sufficient to show that it was not serious although it would probably cause considerable pain and Nelse tied his handkerchief around it to stay the flow of blood I hope we shall have a chance to dress it better before twenty four hours have passed Gil said with a vain attempt to speak cheerfully Father will surely come on shore in search of us when the sun rises and he should be able to follow such a broad trail as we must have left in coming here Your father is at sea by this time Mr Jenkins replied almost sharply Didn t you notice that the wind was blowing half a gale before we arrived here To save the yacht he had to get up anchor and it may be a week before he can get back CHAPTER XIV THE CAVE Neither of the boys had thought that it might become necessary for the Day Dream to leave her anchorage but as the mate spoke both remembered what Captain Mansfield said shortly before they left and the knowledge that their friends had been forced to abandon them brought with it the deepest despair They could hear the wind as it swept across the mouth of the underground passage and this told plainly that if the schooner had not left this particular portion of the coast she would probably be a wreck before morning During a long while the mournful party crouched upon the damp earth silent each occupied with his own gloomy thoughts and then Gil said as he arose to his feet We mustn t give way in this manner Other people have been in worse scrapes and come out all right by keeping a stiff upper lip and watching for some chance to help themselves We are acting like babies You are right lad and Mr Jenkins stood erect clasping Gil s hand Let s see what kind of a place we are in and then perhaps matters won t appear quite so desperate I d give all the wages due me if I knew why these black villains have brought us here It can t be to kill us for that could have been done without any trouble when we were on the beach Gil replied This remark seemed to give Nelse courage and he said joining the others There s no use speculating about what can t be found out until they choose to tell us Let s do as Mr Jenkins proposed and find out where we are I ve got a box full of matches and they ought to give light enough to show how the place looks While speaking he had ignited one of the tapers and all three gazed around eagerly There was but little to be seen An excavation evidently formed by the hand of man about twelve feet deep and eight wide with nothing in it save a pile of charred wood where a fire had once been built made up a complete description of their prison It isn t the most comfortable looking place I ever saw Gil said trying hard to appear cheerful but we might at least kindle a small fire since the materials are so near at hand If our friends make any objection to the plan they can t do much more than put it out A blaze however small would be better than the profound darkness and the boys raked the fragments of wood together partially covering them with sand to prevent a too rapid consumption of fuel It was necessary to use three matches of their now precious hoard before the flames fastened upon the blackened sticks but the outlay seemed none too great when the dispiriting gloom was thus partially dispelled The one question uppermost in the minds of all was why they had been made prisoners and after gathering around the fire this thought would have caused another painful silence but for the mate who said briskly The darkness will seem all the more intense when this wood has been burned and what little we have won t last a great while I don t see how we can help ourselves Gil replied with a sigh I am going out through the passage on a hunt for more And get another blow on the head Tied up as you are in that handkerchief which is covered with blood you look sufficiently like a pirate without trying to add to your peculiar beauty But this time I ll go toward the big cave where our particular friends are probably enjoying themselves Light enough comes from there to show if any one is on guard and I ll guarantee that these villains don t get a second chance to hit me with a club As if fearing his companions might try to dissuade him from his purpose Mr Jenkins crept on his hands and knees to where he could have a view of the passage While it was impossible to distinguish anything distinctly he was able to satisfy himself that there was no one between the two caves and he rose to his feet as he whispered I m bound to have some idea of what them chaps are doing whether I get any more wood or not Stay here and I ll be back in five minutes We had rather go with you Gil replied as he approached the mate It wouldn t be safe If they should happen to see me and kick up a row the passage is so small that the three of us would get all tangled up You can watch from here and have some idea of what I am doing He started as the last word was spoken and the boys could see his form outlined against the faint light until he reached the entrance to this second chamber when he apparently disappeared in the gloom Where has he gone now Nelse asked in a whisper I reckon he s simply leaning against the side out of the range of the fire watching those who are inside Gil s surmise was correct Jenkins was standing where he could get a fairly good view of the interior and that which he saw caused him mingled feelings of surprise bewilderment and fear In the cave which was circular and about twenty feet in diameter were seventeen negroes seated back against the wall of earth thus leaving the greater portion of the floor space free Four small fires were burning as if to designate the points of the compass and between these stood the most repulsive looking old negro the mate had ever seen His wool was gray and hung in matted locks nearly to his shoulders His toothless mouth appeared to be the focus of a mass of wrinkles so deep as to destroy all semblance of a face and gave his head the appearance of a bag with one end puckered by a drawing string The skin of some animal served as a sort of petticoat for the old fellow and around his neck was wound an odd sort of necklace seemingly composed of small bones the ends of which reached nearly to the ground His feet were bare as was the upper portion of his body and in each hand he held a long knife the blade dripping with blood When Jenkins first saw the hideous creature he was standing silent and motionless as if wrapped in deep thought but after a few seconds he aroused himself began walking around each fire in turn muttering in guttural tones and drawing the blade of the knife across his chest causing the blood to flow in tiny streams with every stroke The spectators watched him as if spellbound No one so much as moved and Jenkins could have sworn that they were literally holding their breath Weaving his way in and out among the piles of burning wood the old fellow continued to hack and cut at himself until the entire upper portion of his body was covered with blood and then crouching upon the earth he gazed steadily into the flames for several moments Jenkins was about to turn away believing the performance had come to a close when the negro sprang to his feet with a quick agile movement and looked around upon his companions like one just awakening from a dream Now it could be told from the expression on the black faces that all believed they were about to hear some wonderful revelation and after a certain length of time probably made as long as possible in order to render his words the more impressive the old man began to speak slowly at first but increasing in vehemence until it sounded more like the snarl of an angry animal than the result of a human voice He spoke in a language which Jenkins did not understand but under the circumstances it was not difficult to fancy the long harangue had especial reference to the prisoners During at least fifteen minutes he continued in the most impassioned strain and then ensued the same scene the mate had witnessed near the beach All present began the apparently meaningless dance and song around the fires and Jenkins thinking he had seen enough of this mummery made his way back to those whom he knew were awaiting his return There was no thought of gathering wood as he crept cautiously through the passage and when he reached the place allotted to the prisoners all was dark and still Are you here boys he asked in a low tone Yes you almost stepped on us What are they doing over there We heard the same kind of a chant that attracted our attention when we landed to begin this foolish trip which has ended so disastrously They are cutting those silly capers over again This is what I saw Then Jenkins gave a detailed account of all that had taken place in the chamber from the time of his arrival and when he had finished Gil asked What do you suppose they are up to I reckon Andy could tell you for there can be no doubt but that these are a lot of voudoo worshipers and the fellow with the knife must be a priest or something of that kind Do you suppose they could know that we were in search of pirates treasure Nelse asked Not unless some of them understand English and heard us talking when we came ashore this morning That might be Gil said half to himself but so long as we hadn t found any I can t imagine why we should have been made prisoners Perhaps it was because we saw them at their dances Nelse suggested To Gil this did not seem a very plausible explanation but since he could advance nothing better it was accepted as the true reason We have got to get out of here somehow Mr Jenkins said after a long pause They may not intend to do us any harm but we won t take the risk if it can be avoided Toward morning I m going to make one more effort to find out how many are on guard at the entrance If we could only get hold of our revolvers I know who has them and it is certain he isn t with the mummers therefore he must be outside With his eyes wide open to prevent you either from escaping or trying to get your own again We will see about that We won t make any move until nearly morning therefore it s a good idea to get some sleep if possible Lie down and I ll call you before daybreak The conditions were not favorable for slumber but yet the boys were so tired that in a very short time both were sleeping quietly and the mate seated near the entrance to the excavation was keeping strict watch with apparently not the slightest idea of closing his eyes He could hear the discordant chant from the inner cave now rising high and again dying away until it was lost in the distance and this was continued so long that despite his will the unconsciousness of sleep came upon him CHAPTER XV A DISCOVERY While Mr Jenkins slept the fantastical worship in the inner cave was brought to a close the party separated each man going in a different direction across the island as if to ascertain the general condition of affairs and before they were reunited the sun had risen The wind continued from the same quarter with unabated fury and one needed only to see the trees bending before the blast to understand that the Day Dream could not come to an anchorage near that portion of the coast for some time to come The prisoners were not disturbed until nearly two hours after daybreak and then the mate was brought to his feet very suddenly by a vicious kick from a burly negro who had evidently been selected to act the part of guard Just for an instant Jenkins was disposed to show fight but before he could do anything so rash the thought of the consequences prevented him from raising his hands The situation was sufficiently grave without his making it worse by a useless show of resistance Get up lads he cried wishing to arouse his companions before the brutal guard could deal them a blow and the boys sprang to their feet instantly not understanding where they were for several seconds and then as the unpleasant truth came slowly back to them Gil asked What s going on now I don t know my boy but this dark complexioned gentleman has been trying his toes on my ribs in such an energetic fashion that I fancy we are to make some kind of a move Whatever happens keep close to me and don t provoke the crowd by turning rusty when we re where we can t help ourselves How is the weather Nelse asked About the same as when we arrived here There s no chance of seeing the yacht to day This brief conversation was interrupted by the remainder of the black party who now came from the outside and the prisoners were made to understand by signs that they were to leave the cave With the boys on either side of him Jenkins marched out the huge black walking close behind the three and the others clustered around in a manner which precluded any possibility of an escape The captors were evidently making their way back to the sea once more and to both Gil and Nelse this fact was in some slight degree pleasing since it seemed to bring them nearer the Day Dream How is your head Gil asked when they had walked a short distance in silence It doesn t feel particularly comfortable but I reckon it ll be all right after a while If we could bathe it you would look better That bloody handkerchief and the matted hair gives you the appearance of a veritable pirate I don t feel like one at all events Mr Jenkins replied with a laugh Just now I m more of a cannibal than anything else for it seems as if I could eat a donkey and then look over my shoulder for the rider Do you suppose they intend to starve us That s a hard question to answer It isn t likely they ll take any too good care of us and we stand a chance of going hungry for some time to come Such a thing wouldn t trouble me providing I could see a way out of this scrape Nelse said with a long drawn sigh If the yacht can t come to an anchor while the wind is so strong we needn t expect help to day There ll be a change in the weather when the sun sets the mate replied encouragingly but at the same time he did not believe his own statement The very old negro was evidently the chief of the party and he led them through a narrow path cut amid the dense tangle of foliage until they arrived at the very spot where the prisoners had witnessed the dance around the pot while hidden among the trees Here they were met by the two aged and highly decorated blacks who had acted as masters of the ceremony on the previous evening All the repulsive looking crowd evidently understood that they were in no immediate danger of being hunted out by those interested in the prisoners for they moved with the utmost deliberation The scoundrels know our shipmates can t get here to day and are going to make the most out of the performance whatever it may be Jenkins said angrily as two of the men began to lash him securely to a tree in such a manner that he could do no more than turn his head from side to side The boys were fastened in the same fashion and so near together that it was possible for them to hear each other when speaking in a low tone of voice After the prisoners were thus disposed of the blacks began to prepare breakfast by roasting over a bed of coals fifteen or twenty small animals which resembled rabbits the three leaders retiring to the depths of the thicket as if for consultation while this work was being done The cooks had not even taken the trouble to dress the game but the odor of the roasting flesh was so appetizing and the prisoners were so hungry that all three waited with the liveliest impatience for the meal to be made ready I m certain I can eat a whole rabbit but I don t suppose we ll be allowed to have as much as we want Nelse said watching the operations eagerly We had better not count on regularly filling ourselves up Jenkins replied grimly as a very unpleasant suspicion began to creep into his mind When the feast was prepared the old men were summoned the remainder of the party standing at a respectful distance until they had satisfied their hunger and then all hands set about devouring the food in a literally savage fashion Holding it in their hands and smearing themselves with fat and blood until their black faces looked even more hideous than before the men gorged themselves crunching the smaller bones as dogs would have done and only when the last morsel had disappeared did they cease Meanwhile the prisoners could do no more than gaze at the revolting spectacle which fortunately partially caused them to forget their hunger and not a word was spoken until Jenkins seeing that his companions were rapidly giving way to despair tried to arouse them It s no very great hardship to go hungry for twenty four or even forty eight hours he said cheerily If we think of eating it ll only make matters worse so let s sheer off on some other tack That is not so easily done Nelse replied gloomily I don t know about it Look around and see what an odd sort of a forest this is compared to such as we have at home We ve had time to be pretty well acquainted with it since landing yesterday There doesn t seem to be anything strange here except it is the big palm tree near where the old scoundrels are sitting That Gil would have started to his feet in surprise had it not been for the bonds as he cried It is the very tree we were hunting for There are none others as tall and it s surely old enough to have served as a landmark when our chart was made I believe you are right my boy the mate said after a short pause It would be strange if these villains have shown us just what we wanted to find I can t see that it will do us any good even if we knew a big pile of gold was absolutely buried in the immediate vicinity Nelse replied grumblingly but at the same time he continued to gaze at the palm and it could be seen that for the moment the pangs of hunger were forgotten The possibility of their having finally arrived at the desired place through no inclination or volition of their own was sufficient to furnish them with a fruitful topic of conversation and but little attention was paid to the blacks until the departure of several of the younger men caused Gil to ask Where do you suppose they are going Most likely to watch out for the yacht It isn t certain your father won t make an attempt to put in here in search of us although I don t think one of our boats could land and they want to make sure of not being interrupted During the next half hour the negroes remained idle lounging near the scene of the feast and then the messengers returned Whatever report they made must have been satisfactory for immediately the fire was rebuilt the pot slung on two crotched sticks and the old fellows took up their station nearby as if to repeat the mummery of the previous evening Now the prisoners understood that they were to take some part in the ceremony for three of the men stood directly in front of them while the priests began once more the doleful chant They are going to kill us Nelse cried in alarm but forced to remain motionless before the blacks each of whom held a short bladed knife in his hands Mr Jenkins no longer attempted to cheer his companions He believed as Nelse did and with good reason While the old men sang those who had evidently been selected as executioners advanced slowly brandishing their weapons and making gestures while the remainder of the party stood nearby gazing intently as if at some fascinating spectacle Neither of the prisoners spoke Death seemed so close at hand that the numbness of despair was upon them and each watched the gleaming circles of steel as the knives came slowly toward them When the three men were not more than five feet away from him Gil fancied he heard a slight noise directly in the rear as if some one was lighting a match but since none of the blacks paid any attention to it he fancied he was mistaken and tried to prepare himself in some slight degree for the supreme moment Now the circle of spectators grew smaller the old men forced their way through that they also might witness what was possibly one of their fiendish rites and the gleaming steel almost touched the victims The two boys closed their eyes that they should not see the deadly blow when it was delivered and Jenkins believed he had not many seconds to live when a singular hissing noise was heard directly behind the helpless ones Instantly it seemed that a shaft of fire came from the foliage with a scream as of some living creature Opening their eyes suddenly the boys saw this thing of flame tear its way through the crowd throwing sparks right and left and striking two of the blacks with sufficient force to hurl them to the ground The negroes fled with loud yells of terror as the thing apparently caught by the foliage continued to send forth showers of flame and before the last man disappeared both Gil and Nelse had fainted The strain upon them had been too great and over taxed nature gave way beneath it CHAPTER XVI ANDY At this particular time Jenkins paid but little attention to the boys He fancied the sudden appearance of the stream of fire was simply a portion of the horrible ceremonies and believed the negroes terror to be only simulated When the last black disappeared in the foliage a noise directly behind him caused him to look for their return from that quarter and his surprise can be better imagined than described when he saw Andy standing in front of him his wide mouth open to its fullest extent in silent enjoyment of the complete rout Where in the name of all that s wonderful did you come from he cried and would have followed this with other questions had not the cook whispered hurriedly Dere ain t no time ter tork now kase we s boun ter be outer dis yere place before dem debbils cum back Don speak a word With remarkable celerity Andy cut the bonds of vines and while Jenkins was rubbing his arms and legs to restore the circulation the cook released the boys It was as if the sudden change of position served to restore them to consciousness and by the time the cook had made his arrangements for flight they were aware of the rescue Gil would have followed Jenkins example and overwhelmed the negro with questions but the mate whispered Keep quiet now we can hear all about it later Andy s first care was to gather up the rope like vines and throw them on the fire after which he ran into the thicket returning a few seconds later with a large package wrapped in sailcloth I se gwine erhead an you se mus cum erlong mighty fas ef yer don wan ter see dem imps ergin Without waiting for a reply he started toward the coast to the westward running so rapidly laden though he was that the others had quite as much as they could do to keep pace with him During fully half an hour the flight was continued and just when Nelse was on the point of saying that he could hold out no longer however great might be the danger Andy halted in the midst of a palmetto thicket We se gwine ter stay hyar fur erwhile he said speaking with difficulty because of his heavy breathing but dere mus be a mighty snug watch kept kase dem debbils are boun ter fin out wha s been ergoin on Tell us how you happen to be here and where the yacht is Gil asked as soon as it was possible to speak Andy s story interspersed as it was with threats against and commentaries upon the voudoos would require too great a space to be related in his own words but the substance was as follows After the boat had returned to the yacht and the sailors reported they could find no trace of the missing ones Captain Mansfield was utterly at a loss to account for the singular disappearance He knew there were no wild beasts on the island that could have attacked and killed the entire party therefore it seemed positive the mate and the boys were detained by human beings To search for them in the darkness would have been useless therefore he intended to wait until morning when he proposed going on shore himself but the coming of the gale prevented this plan from being carried into effect It was absolutely necessary the yacht should be gotten under way and in the absence of the mate equally essential for the safety of all on board that the captain should remain in command Knowing they might be obliged to remain away two or three days and distressed at the thought of leaving the missing ones to the mercy of those who had probably captured them Captain Mansfield called for some of the crew to volunteer to go on shore and prosecute a search during his absence None of the sailors cared to venture and then it was that Andy offered his services which were accepted the more eagerly because of all on board he could probably accomplish more owing to the partial acquaintance he had with the natives of this and the adjoining islands He took a small amount of food with him and in addition a number of signal rockets with which to make his whereabouts known as soon as it should be possible for the yacht to come in shore again A revolver and a dozen cartridges together with a canteen of water made up the full list of his stores It was only after the greatest difficulty that the sailors succeeded in setting him ashore for the sea began to run high immediately the wind sprang up and he remained in the thicket near the beach until sunrise when almost before he was ready to commence the search the voudoos chant told him where the prisoners were likely to be found Creeping cautiously up to where a view of the party could be had he realized that it would be the height of folly to make an attack single handed and remained inactive fully believing the prisoners were to be killed until he chanced to think of the signal rockets It was a poor experiment upon which to depend as a means of saving the lives of three people but fortunately it succeeded admirably and there was no question but that the blacks fancied the sparks of fire had been produced by some supernatural agency How did it happen that you dared venture on shore Gil asked when the story was ended You said nothing could tempt you to run the risk of meeting the voudoos and there can be no mistake about the men who came so near killing us I se dun gone got er charm an when de sailors wouldn t cum ershore dere was nuffin lef but fur me ter do my level bes And it couldn t be improved upon Jenkins said as he patted the old fellow s woolly head It was mos ly de charm Andy replied modestly That had precious little to do with it the mate said emphatically The rocket and the man behind it did the business and a thousand charms wouldn t have frightened those villains away so quickly What made you spend so much time burning the vines with which we were tied Nelse asked They couldn t have been used again I wasn erfeared ob dat honey but we wanter make dem debbils t ink dat de ghostes dun took you off ropes an all And it was a good idea Andy Jenkins said Now if we can only keep them at a proper distance until the yacht heaves in sight we shall be all right I se gwine ter dribe de whole bilin offer dis yere island the old man said decidedly much as if he was proposing a very simple piece of business How do you count on doing that Gil asked You said they could do no end of mischief even when hundreds of miles away I se got de charm honey an I se got de rockets Ef we kin creep up on em once I ll start annudder fiery sarpent what ll make de voudoos t ink de las day hab cum If that could be done we would have a chance to find out whether the pirates treasure is hidden near the old palm tree Nelse cried excitedly Now honey don you se go ter speckerlatin erbout dat any mo It s wha s got us all in dis yere trubble an we se gwine ter keep clear ob it ef I se got a vote in de bizness There s plenty of time to talk about that Jenkins interrupted The villains are here yet it isn t any sure thing they can be frightened away and while they remain we shan t be able to do much of anything but keep ourselves out of sight Isn t it about time we thought of eating something Nelse asked suddenly Andy said he brought food from the yacht and I would like to have a bite Take it all honey de ole man ain wantin any now and the cook unstrapped a well filled haversack from his shoulders I se had what ll do me fur de nex four days We ll make an equal division whether there is any chance of your growing hungry or not Gil said as he began to distribute the food It is necessary that we husband it as much as possible unless we can count on seeing father pretty soon He won t be able to make this portion of the coast until the wind blows itself out the mate replied and I advise that we go on short rations to day This remark was hardly necessary since the amount of provisions Andy had brought did not suffice to make one satisfactory meal for the party and every crumb was devoured before the hunger of either was more than half satisfied When the haversack of canvas had been emptied the cook said as he examined the wound on Jenkins head I se gwine ter fix yer up a little Marse Jenkins an den we d better light out ob dis yere place kase dere s no tellin when dat crowd s cumin back ter see wha made de sparks fly The mate would have objected to Andy s spending any time on what he considered a trifling matter but the cook did not wait for remonstrances Using the water in the canteen regardless of whether his companions were thirsty he first bathed the wound and then bandaged it properly with strips torn from Gil s shirt after which he said with an air of pride I lows you se gwine ter git ober dat little scratch widout much trouble an ef dere s no objection we oughter keep on till we light on a better place dan dis yere bunch ob trees After the generalship he had shown there was no reason why the cook should not take command of the party and he assumed the leadership by setting out at a rapid pace toward the coast the others following close behind him Not until they were within sight of the sea at a point two or three miles from where the boys and the mate were made prisoners did he halt and then it was to say I se gwine ter skurmish roun fur ter see whar dem debbils am hidin Why shouldn t we go with you the mate asked Kase dere s no tellin how de charm s gwine ter work fur all han s an de res ob de crowd had better stay hyar till de ole man gits back The boys can take care of themselves for a while and I ll keep you company Jenkins said decidedly We can t afford to run the chance of an accident just now Andy did not fancy being obliged to take a protector with him but the mate was determined to share all the danger and the two plunged into the thicket after impressing upon Gil and Nelse the necessity of remaining hidden during their absence CHAPTER XVII A SUCCESSFUL SCHEME When the mate and cook started out to ascertain the whereabouts of the natives the former carried the revolver and the latter had strapped to his back the bundle of signal rockets At the time their only idea was to learn what the blacks were doing and to that end Andy led the way back toward the cave circling around in such a manner as would permit an approach from the south After traveling at a rapid pace for twenty minutes or more the cook came to a halt exclaiming as he did so Dere s no use tuckerin our legs all out at de start kase dere s plenty ob time How is it that you know this island so well You move around as if you had always lived here Andy tried to evade the question by speaking of the weather and the possibility that the yacht could approach the northern coast by the following morning but Jenkins insisted on an answer and finally the old fellow said I mought jes as well tell de trufe but I don hanker after habin de capt in know erbout it Have you ever taken a hand in this voudoo business Jenkins asked sternly as he watched the old man s face closely Nebber Nebber I se done gone bin in a good many scrapes but nuffin like dat Six or ten years ago when I was young an flighty like annuder colored man an me runned away frum a brig what we d shipped in an hid hyar De voudoos cum mighty nigh killin us erfore we got took off an dat s how I se sich a pertic lar quaintance wid de island Then you have seen these fellows before Ef dey ain jes de same dey looks a drefful sight like em And you knew where the cave was before I said anything about it Deed I didn t fo a fac I nebber seen it but I reckon it was cause we kept mighty near de beach all de time watchin fur a vessel What did you find to eat Dere s plenty ob oysters roun de shore an it s a prime place fur turtles Dere ain t no danger ob goin hungry ef de Day Dream don come back fur a week I m glad to hear that for the yacht may be away some time I don t see any signs that this wind will haul around very soon and the food supply promises to become serious to us If you are rested let s push on the boys may grow frightened if we stay too long Andy acted upon this suggestion at once and the two did not halt again until they had reached a point from which a view of the entrance to the cave could be had while they were screened by the foliage From the first glance it appeared as if the blacks had not returned to their underground hiding place but after waiting five minutes a woolly head was seen at the entrance for an instant and then drawn back very quickly as if its owner did not dare to expose any portion of his precious body very long at a time I se gwine ter plump one ob dese yere rockets right inter dat hole Andy whispered as he began to unwrap the package Don t do anything so foolish the mate replied in the same cautious tone They would then see the stick and know it wasn t the work of supernatural beings Besides we can use them to better advantage by waiting until the whole gang come outside Wha you se mean by dat Some of them have still got the revolvers taken from the boys an me If we could manage to put our hands on them it wouldn t be much of a job to hold the crowd in check for as long as we wanted to stay But how s we gwine ter do dat wid de rockets I don t know we ll wait a while and perhaps something may turn up in our favor Andy was eager to continue his work of terrifying the blacks but he managed to restrain his impatience as Jenkins requested and during the next hour the two remained silent and almost motionless watching intently for the appearance of their enemies During this time two or three of the party had peeped out several times without showing any more of their bodies than was absolutely necessary and Andy had begun to grumble because of the delay when the entire crowd emerged They were walking in couples with the old fellows who had put on a yet larger supply of paint leading the way and from the look of anxiety on their faces it was plainly seen that even the alleged priests felt very uncomfortable in mind Andy held one of the rockets at such an angle as would send it in the midst of the party when it was fired resting the base against a tree to avoid the recoil but Jenkins prevented him from lighting the match until the crowd were a dozen yards beyond the entrance to the cave Now give me your revolver the mate whispered and be sure to take good aim If you miss all that has been done will be wasted The old darky probably remembering when he had been chased by this or a similar gang adjusted the rocket very carefully and then ignited the fuse At the same instant Jenkins discharged every barrel of the revolver aiming low to avoid killing any outright and this portion of the scheme was a perfect success Illustration Andy adjusted the rocket and ignited the fuse See page The rocket plowed its way through the entire line from the rear as if it had come out of the cave and no less than five were thrown to the ground while it could be seen that two of the others had received the attention of bullets Those who were uninjured fled at the utmost speed into the thicket screaming with terror and heeding not the cries of their companions who were begging for assistance The leaders yelled louder than their followers and thought only of their own safety while all hands dropped everything which might impede their flight In the foliage a short distance from where the overturned ones were lying the rocket caught among the branches hissed and sparkled causing the most intense desire on the part of those remaining to leave that particular portion of the island as quickly as possible While scrambling to their feet they did not cease to scream at the full strength of their lungs and once they were in a condition to run every man sought the shelter of the bushes Now is our time Jenkins said hurriedly You rush out there and hunt for the weapons I fancy some of them were dropped during the scramble while I see what there is in the cave that we might want Andy ran like a deer in one direction while Jenkins went in another and five minutes later the two returned laden with the spoils The old darky brought into the thicket two revolvers with one ammunition belt four freshly killed animals such as the blacks had roasted for breakfast and three murderous looking knives Jenkins found two knives a couple of hatchets a small bag filled with yams and a spade he saying as he held up the last mentioned implement for Andy s inspection I don t know what we want of such a thing but I was determined to bring away as much as possible and it may come in handy before we leave We se boun ter make em pay fur de rockets an de spade will count on de bill Hadn we better mosey long to de boys Dey ll be erbout wild ef we don cum mighty soon Lead the way and I ll follow but be careful for it won t do to let those fellows have a glimpse of us Andy understood only too well that their safety depended upon remaining under cover and he conducted the mate back to the place where the boys had been left by a circuitous route toward the east I se lowin dat dem debbils hab all gone ober to the souf shore kase it s frum dere dey kin strike across to de big island so all we has ter do is keep on our end ef we don wan ter see em When the two were with the boys again nearly five hours had elapsed since the time of their departure and both Gil and Nelse were decidedly disturbed in mind I had just decided that we ought to go out in search of you the former said as the cook and Jenkins threw themselves on the ground nearly exhausted by the long rapid tramp That would have been a foolish proceeding even if we had got into trouble the mate said with a laugh If the scoundrels could down us it is safe to say you d hardly been able to render any assistance It s all right though an we can count on being left to ourselves until morning at the earliest Then Jenkins told the boys of what had been done and once more Nelse and Gil began to have hopes that a search might be made for the supposed treasure Can we have something to eat now Nelse asked Wait till dark honey an den I se gwine ter git up a reg lar jubelee feast We kin build a fire an dey can t see de smoke The flames will show more plainly Dey won t kase I se de boy what knows how ter fix sich t ings They were well aware that Andy understood best what should be done and both tried to wait patiently until the time when their hunger could be appeased without too great danger When the sun set the strength of the wind seemed to increase and Jenkins stated as his opinion that another twenty four hours must elapse before the yacht could be brought to the old anchorage It don t make so much difference now that the blacks are frightened and we can defend ourselves in reasonably good shape he said cheerily Unless they contrive to surprise us I ll answer for it that we will hold our own against twice the number At the same time I d rather be on board the yacht until we know they have left the island Nelse said with a feeble attempt at a smile So had I but since it is necessary to wait we might just as well look on the bright side of the affair How long before you are going to dish up some of those rabbits Andy I se ready ter make a start now an dat spade is gwine ter come in mighty handy Ef you ll dig a hole I ll mosey roun fur wood It was dark not so much as a star appearing in the inky blackness of the clouds and the little party could safely move to and fro at will provided they were careful not to make a noise All hands assisted the cook whose fireplace was so far beneath the surface that the flames could easily be screened from view by bushes and never had the boys sat down to a more thoroughly enjoyable meal than this one of roasted rabbits more properly speaking agoutis and yams CHAPTER XVIII TREASURE HUNTING In this world when one desire has been satisfied another springs up as the boys learned after eating a hearty supper for as soon as their hunger was appeased both felt the necessity of slumber It seems as if I hadn t been to sleep for a week Nelse said with a yawn as he stretched himself out at full length where the bushes would screen him from the wind There is nothing to prevent your getting all you want now the mate replied So scoop in a full supply Don t you think it is necessary to stand watch Gil asked Andy and I will attend to that business But we ought to do our share If we are here to morrow night you shall take your turn at it but just at this time it is important to keep a sharp lookout and tired as you boys are I wouldn t like to trust the matter in your hands You needn t be afraid of our going to sleep when it is necessary to keep awake There are some things a fellow can t prevent no matter how good his intentions may be so we won t waste any more time in a discussion Jenkins spoke in such a decided tone that the boys understood it would be useless to continue the conversation and in a very few moments both were sleeping soundly while the mate and Andy stood most vigilant guard Several times during the night the rustling of the leaves or soughing of the wind caused the watchers to make short excursions from the camping place to learn if the enemy were in the vicinity but nothing of an alarming nature was discovered and when Gil and Nelse awakened the general condition of affairs was such as to give them renewed courage The windstorm had cleared away the sun was shining brightly in an unclouded sky and the morning breeze was sufficiently strong to admit of the yacht s working her way up the coast Father should be here before sunset cried Gil as he sprang to his feet You are right my boy the mate said cheerily I allow that she ll be at the old anchorage if the breeze holds before three o clock Have you seen anything of the voudoos Not so much as a hair Andy s just about starting off now to learn if they have gone back to the cave The old darky who was standing near making his preparations for the journey did not speak The expression on his face told how grave and dangerous he considered the mission to be and at such a time he evidently believed it beneath his dignity to enter into conversation The precious rockets he was fastening over his shoulder were to be used in case of a great emergency and the boys noticed that he frequently pressed the bosom of his shirt as if to assure himself of the safety of some object I ll bet he has got his charm there Nelse whispered to Gil I ve noticed that he keeps his hand over that portion of his shirt more than half the time We ll make him show it to us when we get on board the yacht once more Be careful of yourself Jenkins said in a low tone as Andy turned to leave the camping place Don t use the rockets unless it is absolutely necessary and come back as soon as possible Dere ain much danger ob my lingerin roun whar dat crowd is the old man replied as he disappeared among the foliage Now boys I m going to skirmish for some oysters Jenkins said when they were alone Here is one of the revolvers and in case of any trouble fire two shots but don t expose yourself by leaving this thicket Haven t we got enough for breakfast without your leaving us Nelse asked No our appetites were too good last night for anything to be left over from the small amount we managed to get from the niggers We can Bress de Lawd Andy shouted in a loud tone from a distance and as the little party ran in the direction indicated they heard him cry De hull bilin ob dem debbils am makin fur de odder islan as fas as dey kin row De rockets done gone did it Hardly daring to believe the good news Jenkins and the boys kept on at full speed until they were at the beach where a view of the sea to the westward could be had and then their excitement was little less than that displayed by the old darky Far away on the water were three boats one of them probably the Day Dream s tender loaded with men who were working at the oars vigorously and there was no longer any question but that their enemies had been literally frightened away De fiery sarpents was too much for dem Andy cried triumphantly as he went through with a series of contortions evidently intended as a dance of joy We se done gone got de hull islan fur ourselbes It isn t well to show them that we are nothing more than men Jenkins said as he pulled the old darky into the thicket If they get an idea it was only a trick we may have our hands full before the yacht can come up the coast The boys and I will go for something to eat while you keep them in sight until they land on Hayti Keep just inside the thicket so you can t be seen Andy threw off the burden for the rockets were useless now the blacks had abandoned the island and obeyed the order given while the others went toward the northern coast where they would be screened from view of those in the boats Here plenty of shell fish were found and before the old darky returned a most appetizing breakfast had been cooked His report was decidedly encouraging He had seen the blacks land on the adjoining island and watched the boats sufficiently long to assure himself that there was no danger of an immediate return Dey s done gone runned off fur erwhile he said in a tone of satisfaction an we se gwine ter lebe dis yere place erfore dey wants ter cum back Did you see anything of the yacht Jenkins asked Not a hooter I reckon she s done gone round de udder side ob de islan an we se gwine ter see her when she s lettin go de cable I reckon you re right Andy and since there s nothing more to fear we can spend the time as we choose If that is the case Gil said in a serious tone Nelse and I want to make one search for the treasure All Andy s fears were aroused at this mention of the pirates gold as could be told by his face but he made no other protest than to say We se bin in all dis yere trubble jes on count ob dat an it stands to reason we oughter lebe it go But what harm will be done if we spend the time while waiting for the yacht in searching for it When she arrives we shall go on board whether anything has been found or not and there can surely no trouble come of that The old darky made no reply but he shook his head in an ominous manner while his hand rested on his shirt under which the boys believed the famous charm was hidden Have you got the chart Jenkins asked For reply Gil took the piece of paper and strip of wood from his jacket saying as he handed them to the mate The blacks didn t think these were of sufficient value to steal otherwise we might have been obliged to give up the search almost before it was begun An dat would er bin a mighty good t ing Andy muttered without so much as turning his head For at least the twentieth time the mate pored over the document and then he said Suppose we have one try for it That can surely do no harm and it will serve to occupy our time while waiting for the yacht As may be supposed the boys were more than willing to act on this suggestion and Jenkins immediately began making preparations for moving the small amount of stores to the place where they had so nearly met their death Andy assisted in the removal but it could be seen that he was far from being pleased with the proposition and nothing but a wholesome fear of the mate prevented him from giving words to that which was in his mind I take it that the letters F and S are the initials of the man s name who drew this thing Jenkins said when they were at the old palm We ll allow that at all events an try for the course as marked out North and West from the tree Will you take it in feet or fathoms Nelse asked Feet as a starter an if the yacht hasn t hove in sight after we ve dug at that spot it won t do any harm to try fathoms But without a compass you can t be positive as to the direction It s so early in the morning that the sun will serve us for that I reckon an we can verify the course after your father comes Andy had thrown himself on the ground in the shade of the foliage his hand clutching the mysterious something under his shirt as if to show he did not take part in the dangerous investigation but the others paid no attention to him and Jenkins paced off the supposed distance in the gravest manner possible I se boun ter warn you dat we se gwine ter hab trubble ef you se hunts fur de gol Andy said solemnly Better lebe it alone an wait fur de yacht Don t be a fool Jenkins replied petulantly We can t afford to lose so good a chance as this Den I ain in it and the old darky closed his eyes as if to shut out even the movements of his companions As nearly as he could judge from the position of the sun the mate measured the distance and then designated the spot where the boys should begin to dig It s likely to be pretty far down he said as Gil seized the spade an we ll take turns You boys work till you re tired an then I ll do my trick Gil set about the task in the firm belief that but a few moments would be necessary to unearth the treasure and Nelse watched eagerly every turn of the earth Twenty minutes of such exercise under a hot sun was enough for the treasure hunter and then his companion relieved him Jenkins waiting until both should be tired when he would wield the spade Meanwhile Andy had wandered toward the beach as if afraid even to remain in the locality and just at the moment when Nelse was ready to give up in favor of the mate the old darky shouted Hyar comes two boats an dey looks like de Day Dream s tenders CHAPTER XIX THE WRECK When Andy made this startling announcement the treasure seekers abandoned their work to run with all speed to the beach where the statement could be verified by the evidence of their own senses Two boats were coming up the western shore of the island both loaded nearly to the gunwales and evidently heading for the place where the little party was standing There s no question about those being the Day Dream s tenders Jenkins said after a long scrutiny White boats with gilt ribbons are not so plentiful in these waters that there can be more than two sets near here I suppose father has anchored further down the coast and is coming up to look for us Gil said in a tone of satisfaction The mate made no reply but a troubled look came over his face and this deepened into positive dismay as Andy said It beats me why dey s done gone anchored wid a fine breeze what would bring de yacht up hyar like a race hoss Perhaps they saw the blacks when the other boats left the island and want to keep them in sight Nelse suggested This was not a very reasonable proposition but Gil accepted it since he could think of nothing better and Jenkins stood silent and motionless until the occupants of the crafts could be distinguished Then he muttered half to himself If they have left the craft at anchor not one has remained behind to look out for her because the whole crew is here Gil was about to ask what he meant when they were hailed by Captain Mansfield from the leading craft Ahoy on shore Ay ay sir the mate replied Are the boys all right Sound and hearty sir and none the worse for havin stopped ashore a little too long Where is the yacht Off Pearl Point in forty fathoms of water Is she wrecked Gil asked in dismay I ll give you the particulars when we get ashore Captain Mansfield replied It s too hard work to tell much of a story while it is necessary to shout De voudoos done gone did it Andy said in a low tone I lowed dis yere was gwine ter happen when I brung de charm ashore but de captain sisted on some ob de crew cumin an it had ter be done I won t lay it on the voudoos Gil replied mournfully but it is certainly true that we ve had nothing but bad luck from the moment we decided to hunt for the pirates treasure An you se gwine ter hab wuss ef dis yere diggin is kep up It s a pow ful bad plan ter fool round whar dem debbils hang out The boys were not in the humor to discuss this phase of the affair at this moment Both felt as if they were personally responsible for the disaster because of having urged Captain Mansfield to allow them to spend a certain length of time on the island and the knowledge that all hands would now be forced to remain at this place was far from cheering These gloomy thoughts were in their minds when the bows of the boats were run up on the sand and after the first hearty greetings had been exchanged the brief story of the wreck was told After leaving her anchorage the Day Dream was headed down the coast for the purpose of running into Gonaive where a commodious and safe harbor would be found The night was dark the gale so furious that the little craft could not look up to it as she should have done and a miscalculation as to the distance run caused her to be brought around just in time to strike the reefs west of Pearl Point By what at that moment was believed to be a rare piece of good fortune she slipped off into deep water after the first shock but the sharp coral had rent and torn her timbers so cruelly that all efforts to keep her afloat were useless It was possible to work her under the lee of the land where she was sheltered to a certain degree from the angry blast and the crew took to the boats with such supplies as could be gotten at in the hurry and excitement of the moment the jaunty little craft going to the bottom before they had had time to row more than a dozen yards from her side When the gale partially abated we started for this island to satisfy ourselves that you were safe and now I propose to make Cuba in one of the boats taking with me a couple of men Captain Mansfield said when his story was concluded We have got canvas enough for a small sail and once at Havana there will be no trouble about chartering a craft to run over here Is it safe to go so far in the tender Gil asked in alarm The distance to the coast of Cuba is only seventy miles and with a fair wind we should be able to make that in less than twenty four hours But why not take all hands I would like to if our boats were large enough but with these cockle shells it couldn t be done The only question to be considered is whether you will be safe here Tell me what happened after you landed Gil gave his father a detailed account of their adventures Jenkins and Andy adding to the story from time to time and when it was concluded Captain Mansfield said Andy s idea of using the rockets was a capital one and I don t think we need have any fear the blacks will return for some time but if they should your crowd is large enough to resist an ordinary attack I don t expect to be away more than four days and you can surely hold out as long as that Am I to go with you sir Jenkins asked No you must stay here in charge of the party and the boys are to obey your orders as they would mine Now we will see what can be done toward getting breakfast and then set about making ready for the voyage Andy immediately took up the duties as cook and while he and the boys went for a supply of shell fish Jenkins and one of the sailors started in search of water for now that the party was so large a greater amount of the precious liquid would be needed Captain Mansfield lost no time in making his preparations He was desirous of taking advantage of the first fair wind and therefore everything was done on this day Even the water and provisions were put on board the tender so that it would be only necessary to launch her when the proper moment should arrive It was yet quite early in the afternoon when the work was finished and Gil urged his father to go with him and Nelse to the old palm If we are to stay here three or four days there is no reason why we shouldn t continue to hunt for the treasure since it will serve to occupy the time but Andy believes something terrible will happen if we do such a thing If you find any pleasure in digging keep at it by all means Captain Mansfield said laughingly but I don t care to walk even a dozen yards for the purpose of seeing an old tree Andy s foolish talk needn t trouble you for it is merest nonsense to think a voudoo can do more than any other person Gil wanted to get his father s advice as to the best method of testing the correctness of the chart but all pleadings were in vain The captain refused to make any suggestion whatever and the subject was soon dropped as the coming voyage was brought up for discussion During the afternoon one of the sailors walked several miles along the eastern and southern coast to make certain the blacks were not returning and in the hope of sighting some sail but both these missions resulted in the same manner No craft of any kind could be seen and at an early hour all hands turned in on the sand it being thought unnecessary to stand watch It was not yet daylight when the boys were awakened by Jenkins who said as they opened their eyes The wind has come around from the south ard an east ard and the captain is ready to start The little tender had already been launched and it was only necessary for the voyagers to step aboard At the last moment Captain Mansfield had decided to take but one of the sailors with him in order that as large a force as possible might be left behind in case the blacks should return bent on mischief and the remainder of the party stood on the beach to say good by We won t go very strong on the parting business the captain said as he saw by the faces of Gil and Nelse that they were considerably distressed because of his leaving With this wind we shall be on shore again by sunset and the trip will be nothing more than child s play Keep together as much as possible and remember that Mr Jenkins is in command Then he took his seat at the helm the tiny sail was hoisted and in a few seconds the little craft was lost to view amid the gloom Those who had been left behind set about getting breakfast for the voyagers preferred to eat theirs in the boat rather than lose time by waiting on shore until a meal could be cooked and when this very important portion of the day s duties was finished the question arose as to what should first be done Jenkins sent Andy down the coast to watch lest the blacks should return unobserved and then the boys proposed that they be allowed to continue the search for the supposed treasure To this the mate agreed after some slight hesitation and once more the work of digging was begun but on this occasion fathoms instead of feet were measured off according to the suggestion of the sailor who said It don t stand to reason that any decent pirates would put down figgers cordin to shore lingo It s fathoms or I m a duffer Whether or no he was a duffer both Gil and Nelse were willing to try the experiment more especially since the first attempt resulted in such a signal failure and when the bearings had been taken this time accurately with one of the compasses saved from the Day Dream the boys went to work in good earnest assisted now and then by the men During an hour they labored industriously without having seen anything to give encouragement and just as Gil was on the point of saying that he had had enough of digging for supposititious gold the spade struck something which gave forth a metallic sound There s more than earth down here he exclaimed triumphantly plying the tool with renewed vigor and Jenkins leaped into the excavation as he cried Upon my word lad I believe there s something in that chart after all Give me the spade until we see what s below here Now all hands were literally trembling with excitement as the mate threw out the loose sand in a perfect shower and when several fragments of decayed wood were disclosed each one believed the desired discovery was about to be made CHAPTER XX THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE The treasure seekers were not kept long in suspense after the first evidence that there was some foreign substance beneath the surface In less than ten minutes Jenkins cleared the sand away exposing to view an iron bound hatch which presented the appearance of having been taken from a small vessel It showed every sign of age The iron was so eaten with rust as to be nothing more than thin ribbons of metal and the wood had been bored by insects or worms until it looked like a gigantic sieve If there s any treasure on this island here s where we shall find it the mate said as he paused to wipe the perspiration from his face It don t stand to reason that men would spend their time burying a thing like this and then make a chart to show exactly the spot unless there was something valuable underneath Of course there s plenty of gold down there and perhaps we shall find a lot of diamonds and jewelry Gil cried excitedly Why don t you lift it up That s more than can be done from below here unless the hole is made at least twice as large which will be too much work to suit me There are some pieces of rope on the beach that were left over after we finished riggin the boat Get them an we ll soon have a purchase that ll raise this ere cover mighty easy Both the boys started for the shore at full speed They were too much excited to be able to converse about the matter and without saying a single word gathered up the desired articles returning to the scene of the discovery in a wonderfully short space of time When they arrived Andy had come up from the beach to report that no craft of any kind was in sight and he stood looking at the ancient hatch in silent horror You see the chart we found meant something after all Nelse cried triumphantly as Jenkins set about rigging a rude purchase to a tree which stood near by It meant dat we wus boun ter git inter de biggest kin ob trubble the old darky replied after a short pause You hear me chillun dis yere is a mighty bad bizness Ef you se ain hankerin arter de wuss scrape you se ebber heard ob kiver dat hol up right smart But what is the matter with your charm Nelse asked It worked well since the voudoos got hold of us and why should it fail now It ain strong enuf fur dis kin ob fussin nuffin would stan dat Andy replied moodily Now don t begin your croaking again Jenkins said with a laugh the apparent certainty of finding treasure causing him to feel very happy We ve pulled through so far an I reckon there won t be anything startling happen before we can get a peep of what is underneath this hatch How s you se bin pullin trou the old darky asked angrily Didn t you se cum widin a han s bref ob bein killed But we wasn t and the rockets instead of your charm did the business for us Has yer done forget when de men set us driftin roun in de little boat We got our own jest the same and didn t have to undergo many hardships Kin yer git de yacht ag in Ain she dun bin sunk by de voudoos She is sunk for a fact but the fellows on this island didn t have anything to do with it Who tole yer so My own common sense Den let yer common sense show yer how ter git outer de scrape what you se hankerin fur now and Andy stalked solemnly away not so much as turning his head when the boys begged of him to wait until the hatch should be raised At that moment when they were all so happy at the apparently successful result of their labors the old darky s anger seemed very comical and no one tried to restrain his mirth until Jenkins said This won t do if we want to find out how much treasure the pirates have buried here All hands tail onto the rope and we ll soon have gold enough to tassel our handkerchiefs in great shape It required considerable labor to raise the cumbersome mass of wood and iron but it was finally accomplished and as the hatch swung above the surface each member of the party rushed to the edge of the excavation excitedly Instead of seeing a vast amount of valuable plunder such as pirates are supposed to hide nothing more startling than a deep hole or shaft met their gaze The stuff must be at the bottom Gil said after all had looked in silence for several moments It s a shaft of some kind Jenkins added half to himself and I reckon we ve had our labor for our pains Old Andy knew what he was about when he refused to have anything to do with the scheme It isn t certain that we ve worked for nothing Nelse replied I can see what appear to be steps cut in the side and as likely as not we shall find all we want at the bottom Seeing there s nothin better to do we might as well find out the whole story Lay hold of that rope an lower me down In another instant the mate was descending His companions were able to perform their portion of the task with but little difficulty because he found a foothold here and there by which he could aid himself At least twenty feet of the rope had been payed out when he shouted I m at the bottom and there is a tunnel which runs on the level Lower something for a torch and I ll keep on Why can t we all come down Gil asked There s nothin to prevent Throw some light wood in first and then make the rope fast to a tree You can come hand over hand without any trouble After gathering what would be sufficient to supply the party with torches for several hours Jenkins orders were obeyed and the boys and the sailors were soon with the mate in a tunnel leading at right angles from the shaft of sufficient height for one to walk upright The passage looked as if it had been hewn from the solid coral and although evidently not used for many years the air was pure as if it had never been closed Some little difficulty was experienced in lighting the wood but when that had been done Jenkins marched on holding the torch as high as possible that all might see this underground path which was supposed to lead to the valuable deposit It s certain this tunnel wasn t dug for nothing Gil said after they had walked at an ordinary pace for at least twenty minutes without having seen anything but the coral walls People wouldn t spend much time on such work simply for fun and it must have required many days to hew out such an amount of rock I reckon we ve come to the end Jenkins replied as the passage began to trend upward at a very decided inclination and a moment later he stopped at what appeared to be the termination of the tunnel Before them was apparently a solid wall but as the light was thrown on it Gil could see a crevice very narrow and nearly filled with dust at the side and bottom It s a door he cried and behind it is the gold Jenkins handed the torch to Nelse and threw his whole weight against the rock It yielded slightly giving an opening not more than half an inch wide through which warm air and a glow as of a fire entered the tunnel Quickly and without speaking the mate extinguished the torch and to the astonishment of all the sound of voices could be heard indistinctly it is true but sufficiently to make it positive human beings were conversing at no very great distance from the aperture This was a conclusion to the tour of discovery upon which the explorers had not reckoned and for several moments all stood in silent dismay not knowing what course to pursue Then Jenkins tried to close the stone door but in vain It was perfectly smooth and he could gain no hold upon it But few seconds were spent on the useless work Whispering softly the mate directed his companions to retrace their steps with as little noise as possible and all hands crept back through the now dark tunnel to the foot of the shaft which they had entered What are we to do now Gil asked impatiently That s just what we must decide upon Jenkins replied an it isn t going to be an easy question to answer Who do you suppose the men are Nelse asked I thought it was certain all the blacks had left the island It seems that we made a mistake in coming to that conclusion I ve an idea the tunnel leads straight back to the cave where we had the pleasure of spending one night Then the apparent mystery can be explained if we make a search there Gil suggested You are right but it will be a good idea to hunt mighty cautiously or we may find ourselves in a worse scrape than before You stay here while I take a short trip in that direction and at the same time warn Andy of what has been discovered Both of the boys were unwilling the party should separate Strength of numbers seemed to be their only protection and the loss of one would be very serious Jenkins however was positive his plan offered the only chance of safety and after some discussion the others agreed to it I ll take one of the revolvers and you fellows will have the other It is likely that I shall be away some time therefore you mustn t get nervous if I stay nearly all day You had better get in the tunnel half a dozen yards from the shaft so your voices won t be heard if anybody happens to come this way But what about Andy I ll try to make him come down here for it isn t safe to remain where those people whoever they are may find an opportunity of getting hold of him After giving these orders Jenkins swarmed up the rope hand over hand and without so much as an adieu disappeared from the view of those in the shaft The three waited in almost perfect silence during fully half an hour and then as a slight rustling was heard from above the cook s head could be seen at the edge of the excavation His black face was literally gray with terror and one would have said his eyeballs protruded very much more than usual as he asked in a hoarse whisper Am it er fac dat you chillun reckon on stayin hyar wid de whole crowd ob voudoos so nigh at han What else can we do Come out an hide whar dere s a chance to gib de debbils de slip ef dey begin cuttin up shines CHAPTER XXI A TRAP The sailors superstitious as are nearly all their class believed the wisest course would be to follow the old darky s advice arguing that since he knew more about the island and the ways of the repulsive beings who had been found upon it than any one else it was reasonable to suppose he could best extricate them from their uncomfortable situation Both Gil and Nelse however were determined to stay where they were until Jenkins returned and to this end the former said to Andy Come down here until you know what has been found There can be no danger since you ve got your charm with you and we are now positive that all the blacks have not left the island I dun seed em go wif my own eyes You saw three boats but I tell you there are more not far from here and what is worse it s the old ones who have been left behind Andy appeared incredulous until the sailors joined with Gil in the statement and then looking around suspiciously as if expecting to see his enemies near at hand ready to spring upon him the cook prepared to descend by first clutching firmly the mysterious something which was concealed beneath the bosom of his shirt On reaching the bottom of the shaft he went through a series of gestures probably intended for the purpose of warding off danger and then whispered cautiously Wha hab you seen honey Don t try to fool wid de ole man kase dis yere am no kinder time ter play pranks when de wustes sort ob trubble am cummin I don t want to fool you Gil replied impatiently but it is necessary you should know that there are people in a sort of cave perhaps the very one where we were kept prisoners and their voices can be heard distinctly if you listen at the end of this tunnel where it looks as if a wall of solid rock rose right up before you Go on and try to make out what they are talking about While speaking the boy had seized the old darky by the arm as if to force him onward and the latter shrank back with every show of terror I wouldn t go dere fur a millyon dollars an dat s eh fac Andy said with a long drawn sigh Af it s de ole debbils wha hab been lef behin de odders are skinnin roun fur ter get a crowd ober hyar to ketch us all Why would so much trouble be necessary when they outnumber us at least three to one Nelse asked Dat s jes wha dey don know honey De fiery sarpints hab done made em t ink we se er hard gang an dey s gwine ter bring more ob dem ole fellers ter help erlong wid de hoodoo Upon this point Andy appeared to be so positive that it would have been only a waste of time to argue the matter and Gil urged him to follow up the tunnel in the hope of learning by the conversation who the men were in the subterranean chamber This was a most signal failure however for the old darky not only refused to take a single step in the desired direction but would not so much as look into the opening I se done gone had enuf ob sich t ings he said solemnly an now I m gwine ter keep my ole head outer trubble whar dar s a chance Dere s a boat hyar what b longs ter de captain an de bes t ing we kin do is ter git way frum dis yere islan afore de witches gin ter take a han in de muss We are willing to risk it a while longer and your charm should be sufficient to make you stay while the rest of the party are here Nelse said with a nervous laugh which had very little mirth in it I se got frou takin chances no matter ef I had er hun red charms the old darky replied clutching yet tighter that which was suspended from his neck We wants ter mosey outer dis yere place nebber min wha Job Jenkins says erbout it kase I tells yer chillun it am mighty onhealthy when dem debbils begin for to git in dere work Then Andy started to his feet as if on the point of swarming up the rope again but before he could do so the mate appeared at the opening above saying in a whisper as he began to descend Take care below there for the sun blinds my eyes so I can t see where I m going In another instant he was in the midst of the anxious group all of whom with the exception of Andy began to overwhelm him with questions It won t take long for me to tell the story Jenkins said as he seated himself on the ground There is no question but that this passage leads to the big cave I went there and hunted around quite a while before finding any signs of another outlet Things were just as when I saw them last an I could a taken my oath the whole crowd skipped out after the second dose of signal rockets until I ran across what appeared to be a door cut in a piece of coral Did you open it Gil asked eagerly Of course What would a been the use of lookin if I didn t do the thing in proper shape I pried the stone open till I could see a narrow passage that led in this direction an then I stopped for there was no reason of pokin my nose into danger I reckon we d better take to the boat if we can manage to stow into the one we ve got for if that crowd comes back as I feel certain they re bound to do we ll be in hot water Now you se torkin sense Andy said quickly When a man shoves his head inter de lion s mout once dat may be a mistake but ef he does it de secon time dat shows how big er fool he kin make ob hisself The sailors were also eager to get away from such a dangerous locality and against this preponderance of opinion neither Gil nor Nelse thought he should make any objections although both believed the safest plan would be to take the chances and await Captain Mansfield s return Now that the mate shared his opinion in regard to leaving the island Andy was in a perfect fever to get away and without waiting for the others he swarmed up the rope to the surface the remainder of the party following a few seconds later urged to what seemed foolish haste by his description of the dangers which threatened Don t stay down dar torkin bout nuffin he said instantly on gaining the surface I se been right yere afore an knows how dese images kin skip roun when dey has bizness We se boun to mosey erlong like er flea less we wants ter be cotched ergin Now don t run the risk of carryin away your spars by crackin on too much sail said Jenkins with a laugh I allow the fellers won t be back for two or three days an we can take things easy The old darky was most vehement against delay and did not cease to repeat what the blacks were able to do until all the party were out of the tunnel Then he would have started toward the shore without even waiting to gather up the small store of goods they had left on the surface if Jenkins had not peremptorily ordered him to stop until they were in proper marching order When the necessary arrangements had finally been made Andy darted through the underbrush at such speed that the others were obliged to exert themselves to the utmost in order to keep pace with him and the heat rendered rapid traveling both painful and exhausting Let him go ahead Jenkins said impatiently after five minutes passed during which the whole party had been running rather than walking He s worse than an old woman when he gets frightened an we couldn t move faster than we re doin now if the whole crowd were at our heels There s no reason why we shouldn t take our time and Gil halted for a comfortable breath It will be better to start after dark anyway for no one could row very long in this heat Having thus allayed their own nervousness the little party proceeded toward the beach in a most leisurely fashion until the sound of the surf told that they were very near the sea when Andy burst through the underbrush at a faster gait than he had departed His black face was of an ashen hue and his eyes open and staring as he said in a hoarse whisper De boat s dun gone What do you mean you fool the mate asked angrily She s gone an dat s a fac Dem ole debbils knowed wha we was er tryin ter do an dey ve hoodooed her outer sight Probably you didn t go within half a mile of where we left her Dere s de tree we hitched her to an you kin see whar dem as took her off walked roun huntin for us Then what you mean is that the crowd have come back an we re cut off again Jenkins replied in a tone of relief despite his oft repeated assertion that he did not believe in what Andy called cunjurin Dat am de fac I thought you said the old men had hoodooed her Nelse added and the old darky said with considerable show of spirit Ob course dey did else how could dem wuffless trash know where to fin her It wouldn t be a bad idea to have a look at the beach Jenkins said as he took a revolver from his pocket Just as likely as not Andy has made a mistake The others pressed forward but the cook refused to move a single step He declared that no earthly power could force him to leave the shelter of the trees and was so vehement in his protestations that even the boys began to think perhaps it would be as well to exercise a little caution Don t rush right out in the open for fear those who stole the boat may see you Gil said to the mate Perhaps the best way would be for us to stay here while you have a look around All right keep under cover an I ll soon be back Mr Jenkins said as he disappeared from view amid the foliage and the remainder of the party waited in silence for his return They were not to be kept very long in suspense Five minutes later the mate returned looking very serious and Nelse asked eagerly What did you see Enough to make me wish your father had waited one day longer From the appearances I should say a regular mob of men had been around where we left the boat and there is little doubt but that they are the same kind of a crowd we saw dancin near the fire They ve made off with our craft an now count on huntin us down at their leisure Although this information was no more alarming than what Andy had predicted the old darky seemed to be literally paralyzed with fear He remained silent and motionless staring at Mr Jenkins as if in the latter s face he could read even more terrible intelligence than had already been imparted CHAPTER XXII RUN TO COVER Andy was not the only one who felt as if an unkind fortune had dealt the crowning blow in a series of disasters and that it would be useless to struggle longer against such overwhelming odds It is true the little party were armed after a certain fashion and could act on the defensive for a short time in a creditable manner but the supply of ammunition was woefully small and when the last cartridge should have been fired they had only two knives and two hatchets with which to hold their own against a party of perhaps forty To each one these thoughts came much as if they had been presented for consideration and after five minutes or more had been spent in mournful reflections Jenkins said with a feeble attempt at cheerfulness It s worse than foolish for us to sit here moonin over what we ve got to meet like men It ll be strange if we can t hold our own against such a crowd as is on this island but we sha n t make any headway by suckin our thumbs You are the leader and we are waiting to hear what you propose doing Gil replied forcing himself to speak firmly and even carelessly because of the effect he knew his words would have upon the others That s what I haven t had time to decide on Jenkins said deliberately Suppose we try to cook up some plan between us What is your opinion Andy The old darky shook his head but made no reply He was without hope and could do no more than clutch the charm which was covered by his shirt but even his faith in this seemed to have been shaken by the news that the main body of the enemy had returned to the island Jenkins waited a few seconds for some one to speak and as all remained silent he said in a thoughtful tone It stands to reason we ve only got to hold our own a few days at the outside for the captain is bound to be back before long and then all the trouble will be at an end It is now so near night that I reckon we can count on bein left alone till mornin an with so much time before us we ought to be able to make considerable headway takin care of ourselves The first thing is to find a hidin place an Andy knows more about this island than any one else so he must attend to that portion of the work It can t be did the old fellow said in a whisper Dem brack debbils done gone know ebbry spot on dis yere islan whar a skeeter could poke his nose an dey s boun to hab us out fore ter morrer mornin That remains to be seen Gil replied It is certain they ll get hold of us if we sit here doing nothing but it must be possible to hide during the short time father will be gone You are right Gil an if we don t lose our pluck things is sure to come out all right Jenkins said approvingly It won t do to trust to the shelter of the trees for those fellows can track us down so I go in for hittin on some spot where we can hold out against them till the captain comes Yes but where ll we find such a place Nelse asked That is what we must hunt for an there s no time to lose because it ll soon be too dark to travel around much Jenkins looked toward Andy as he spoke but the old darky did not so much as move an eyelid He acted as if all hope had fled and he was trying to resign himself to the inevitable I should think it would be a good idea to hunt around for food before we go into hiding Nelse said after a pause We may be obliged to keep under cover quite a while and according to the experience I have had on this island it isn t always convenient to go whenever a fellow feels so disposed You are right my boy and I ll hunt for a hiding place if the rest will act on your suggestion We can meet here any time between now an sunset so there ll be no danger of losing each other Andy show them where the shell fish can be found easiest The cook who had thrown himself on the ground as if in such despair that his legs could no longer be depended upon to do their duty rose slowly and silently which was sufficient intimation that he would so far oblige however unnecessary he might think it to provide for a party who were doomed to death Bring in everything eatable you can find Jenkins said and then started through the underbrush to perform his portion of the work Gil was forced to speak quite sharply to Andy before the latter would lead the way toward the beach but after the old fellow once started he did his best to procure the provisions in the shortest possible space of time When the party left the shelter of the trees and walked cautiously out on the sands where the gentle swell of the sea was rolling up in tinkling measures not a sign of the enemy could be seen It was as if they were alone on the island and while this apparent security caused the others to feel considerably more confident than at any time since it had been discovered the boat was stolen it filled Andy with the gravest apprehensions I se done been hyar afore he said with a solemn shake of the head an I tell yer honey we se gwine ter hab a power ob trubble There don t seem to be any signs of it around here Nelse replied with a laugh Dat s kase yer don t know wha kin ob folks dese yere imps be honey Dey s layin low like now but look out fur em look out I say an don trus de snake jes kase he ain in de humor fur bitin Dey s done got dere eyes on us now an when de right time comes we se gwine to fin it out If they don t do any more than keep their eyes on us for the next hour we shall stand a good chance of laying in a stock of provisions for the oysters appear to be plentiful on this part of the beach Andy contented himself with simply shaking his head as if to say he could tell a great deal more if he felt disposed and then all hands began industriously gathering the shell fish which were to be seen just above the low water mark in enormous beds It was hard work to detach them from the seaweed and rocks but the little party were literally laboring for life and before an hour had passed a heavy load for each member was secured There s no need of taking more than we can lug comfortably Gil said when the tide had covered the largest beds and now comes the question of how they may be carried to the place where we agreed to meet Jenkins I reckon my mate an me can rig up somethin that ll answer for baskets one of the sailors replied as he began gathering a quantity of vines and in this labor Andy assisted without being especially requested so to do Under the skillful fingers of the three men the vines soon assumed shape and the sun was yet above the horizon when five rude receptacles had been woven After these were filled with oysters it was found that each one had as much of a load as could comfortably be carried on his back and laden heavily all hands started for the rendezvous arriving there just as the mate returned looking tired and disappointed We ve done our portion of the work Gil said cheerily and what have you accomplished Nothin so far as a hidin place is concerned It won t do to go so far into the interior of the island that we stand a chance of gettin lost while tryin to find our way back to the beach an I can t find a spot where anything bigger than a rabbit could hide himself this side of the cave Did you see anything of the blacks Yes the whole crowd are near the entrance an from the appearance of things they have got over the scare we gave em How many are there Thirty at the lowest calculation without countin them as were hidin in the cave All hands are loafin around the entrance as if not carin whether we saw them or not an I reckon they ve sized us up mighty nigh right But what are we to do to night Nelse asked his voice betraying the uneasiness he felt There is only one plan I can think of which is to get into the tunnel we found Why that would be putting ourselves directly in their power Nelse cried and Andy looked at Jenkins as if fancying the mate had suddenly lost his reason When it comes to dots we are in their power already and without much chance to defend ourselves if they should surround us in this thick underbrush There we could hold our own for a while at any rate because not more than one could attack us at a time an our revolvers would keep em back a good many hours The boys immediately recognized the force of the argument as did both the sailors but Andy was literally beside himself with impatience because such a scheme had been proposed I se done gone got enuff ob dis yere crowd he said angrily When you cotch de old man runnin his nose inter de hornet s nes jes tell him he s makin a mighty big fool outer hisself We se bad enuff hyar widout makin it wuss But Andy it really seems to be the best thing we can do Gil said persuasively It is as Mr Jenkins says we shall at least have a chance of defending ourselves there and it s only necessary to hold out until father gets back before the trouble will be at an end Then we can show these scoundrels a trick or two at hunting which perhaps they won t appreciate so well I preciate dis yere scrape an ain gwine ter put my nose in any mo the old fellow replied doggedly Ef you is boun dar go ahead an Andy ll kinder grub roun fur hisself But we mustn t separate you obstinate old man Can t you see that there s a chance with all this food of holding our own a good many hours Whar s de water Bymby somebody s gwine ter want er drink an den whar ll de debbils be I hadn t thought of that Gil exclaimed in dismay and Jenkins added quickly We must try to lay in a stock to night I ll run the risk of snoopin round a bit after dark an it ll be hard lines if I can t bring in a little At any rate it s better to be in the tunnel where we ve got a show for our lives an be thirsty than stay out here where all hands can be surrounded by daylight If Andy won t go with us I don t see any other way than let him paddle his own canoe The sailors decided in favor of the mate and Gil and Nelse could do no less than agree with the more experienced and less timid portion of the party We ll go to the tunnel Gil decided after a pause and if Andy wants to stay outside it can t be helped I se gwine ter look arter myself the cook replied doggedly and without further conversation he disappeared among the underbrush CHAPTER XXIII SECRET OF THE CAVE The cook hurried away so quickly that his companions had no time to persuade him to a different course even provided they wished to do so and when he was out of sight Jenkins said as he took up the load of oysters which Andy brought It won t do any good for us to stay here talkin about what the old fool has done for we must get under cover before it is too dark to admit of seeing our way through the woods His pig headedness may cost him his life but we are not to blame It only remains for us to take care of ourselves Do you propose to go directly there or shall we circle around so they can t track us easily Nelse asked It ll be as well to drive ahead I reckon they ll find us out anyhow for we can t hide the trail any better than these woods will do it for us Then Jenkins signified that he was ready and the little party each carrying a quantity of oysters followed at his heels in perfect silence The mate had the bearings of the old palm well in mind and went directly toward it without swerving to the right or the left coming to a halt only when he reached the spot where a few hours previous the boys had been so certain a large amount of treasure was about to be found Although he had said that the blacks would be certain to discover their hiding place he took good care not to make any more noise than was absolutely necessary Swarm down there he whispered cautiously and the last man shall pull the rope after him for it won t do to let those blacks have a chance to steal it If we do that how will it be possible for us to come up again Gil asked We can t make the rope fast above while all hands are below I have thought of that We must take the chances of climbin up the sides by diggin small holes where the sand is hardest At all events I ll guarantee we get back here again if they leave enough of us One of the sailors obeyed the motions made by the mate and began to slip slowly down the rope When he was at the bottom of the shaft first one and then another of the bags were lowered until all had disappeared and then the second sailor followed his comrade Now remember to pull the rope after you an don t show yourselves again till you hear me speak Jenkins said as he urged Gil toward the mouth of the shaft What do you mean Don t you intend to come with us Not just yet We ve got to have water an I m goin for some You ve nothing to bring it in no matter how much you should find I ve got a scheme for attendin to that part of the business an want to leave as soon as possible so don t make me stay here chinning Gil realized that it was not the time to ask many questions and he obeyed without another word after Nelse had let himself down the opening In less than five minutes from the time the second sailor joined the first all hands except Jenkins were crouching in the tunnel with the rope coiled up beside them and already had the shades of night gathered so densely that it was impossible to distinguish each other save by the tones of the voices Now they had reached what seemed a desirable hiding place while the matter was under discussion it no longer appeared either safe or comfortable and the prospect of being besieged while in such cramped quarters was anything rather than pleasant I m beginnin to think Andy had more sense than the rest of us one of the sailors said as he tried to find a spot where he could stretch out at full length It ll be mighty hard lines after them imps shut us in here like rats in a trap an when the captain comes back I d like to know how he s goin to find us if there are fifteen or twenty blacks standin around the openin up there ready to kill the first who shows himself long enough to hail them as may be huntin for us This was a phase of the case which neither Gil nor Nelse had taken into consideration and they began to feel very uncomfortable in mind What should we do if we heard father and couldn t let him know where we were he asked in a whisper I m sure I don t know Nelse replied with a long drawn sigh It is certain we couldn t make our whereabouts known and I m inclined to think we ve been more than foolish to come here We might leave now and take our chances in the woods as Andy is doing How would you contrive to get out Gracious I d forgotten that we re shut in here already Nelse exclaimed and then he relapsed into silence while Gil tried in vain to see some cheerful ray in the very disagreeable situation During the next half hour nothing was said and then one of the sailors spoke Never mind what s goin to happen there s no call for us to be hungry while there are so many oysters waitin to be invited to supper Here goes for a couple of dozen Can you boys open them I never tried but this seems like a good time to begin Gil said with a vain attempt to laugh You d make a poor fist if you re green at the business Set close both of you an I ll engage to fill you up before startin in for myself Speaking about food had caused the boys to remember that they were very hungry and they accepted the generous proposition without delay It is certain that trouble seems less when viewed by one whose stomach is full as Gil and Nelse soon learned When the satisfactory meal was ended both ceased to think the situation so very desperate and actually began to plan what steps should be taken to continue the search for the supposed treasure as soon as Captain Mansfield returned That Jenkins did not come back although the night had fully shut in gave them no uneasiness for all believed he would play the spy once more before joining them and it would not be surprising if he were absent until past midnight It was dull work sitting there in the darkness after the conversation regarding their movements when they should be free was exhausted and it seemed as if they must have been in the tunnel several hours when Gil said with a yawn Of course somebody must keep awake so s to hear Jenkins when he wants the rope passed up to him but that s no reason why all hands of us should sit here nodding You re right lad Turn in an me an my mate will tend to the rest of the business But you must have some sleep We ll have a chance to get plenty before leavin this ere hole so don t trouble your head about us We ll crawl back a short piece and try to find a place where we can stretch out at full length Gil suggested and Nelse replied Go ahead I ll follow close enough to keep hold of your coat Gil proceeded on his hands and knees to avoid a possible fall and at least twenty yards had been traversed when his companion asked Don t you think we ve gone about far enough It isn t safe to get too near that door at the end for there s no knowing when the blacks may come down this way Up to this point a fellow would have had to double himself into a bowknot in order to lay down and we re not so very far from the shaft I ll go on a little further and then if it hasn t widened we might as well rejoin the others because The sentence was never finished for at that instant Nelse felt the earth sink beneath him and Gil s coat was torn from his grasp as its owner plunged forward For a few seconds Nelse remained motionless unable to understand what had happened and then he realized that his companion must have been precipitated into a cavity of some kind although the floor of the tunnel appeared firm when the whole party traversed it a few hours previously Gil Gil he called and it seemed almost an endless while before the reply came I m all right but I must have fallen twenty feet or more and the breath was pretty nearly shaken out of my body What can I do to help you Get the rope and pull me out for I don t fancy staying here all night It doesn t sound as if you were buried very deep I m not buried at all but simply in a big hole which I don t care to explore for fear of getting into worse trouble By this time Nelse had collected his partially scattered senses and at once made his way back to the shaft with all speed startling the sailors into something very nearly resembling fear as he hurriedly told what had befallen Gil This ere is gettin too hot to suit me one of the men said in a tone of apprehension Who knows but that them black scoundrels have got a way to let the whole bottom drop out of the tunnel an that s why we ve been allowed to crawl in here Of course such a thing couldn t be because they had no idea we should find the shaft perhaps don t know where we are That may be but I m beginnin to think a good deal as Andy does about the island s bein bewitched It wouldn t do any good just now if you were positive that such a state of affairs existed Gil is in the hole and it doesn t seem fair to leave him there while we talk nonsense You re right lad an I m an old fool Here s the rope heave ahead an we ll foller but be careful not to tumble into the same place Some one should stay here in case Jenkins comes back Nelse suggested as he began to retrace his steps and one of the sailors said as he lighted his pipe I ll hang around You two can tend to him I reckon It was not an easy matter to find the cavity without falling in and Nelse moved forward slowly calling to Gil from time to time until the latter answered thus guiding him to the proper place Where s the rope he asked and instead of replying the sailor lighted a match saying as he did so I d like to have a squint around before we do very much for it ain t sure Have you got the rope Gil cried impatiently It s here an we ll soon have you out Can t you send down some kind of a light I ve fallen on what I truly believe is the decaying fragments of a chest and unless I m very much mistaken in regard to what I ve got in my hand we ve struck the treasure at last CHAPTER XXIV THE TREASURE CHAMBER Strange as it may seem Gil s announcement caused Nelse to forget entirely the danger by which they were surrounded and regardless of the fact that none of the party were certain of ever leaving the tunnel alive his only desire now was to gain possession of the supposed hoard The sailor was not one whit less excited he had a stock of matches in his pockets but could not find them until after a search of several seconds owing to extreme agitation caused by Gil s announcement Do hurry Nelse cried impatiently as the man fumbled about his clothing Something may happen to prevent us from seeing the treasure if you spend so much time doing nothing I m trying to find another match an then perhaps we can rig up somethin that ll answer for a torch but it seems as if my fingers were all thumbs jest now Don t keep me waiting here all day for I want to know what I ve struck Gil cried and after a few seconds more a tiny flame told that the sailor had finally succeeded in finding that which was wanted so badly just at that moment Nelse seized the first opportunity to search with his eyes for something which would serve as a torch but the floor of the tunnel was as clean as though swept with a broom and he said to Gil There isn t so much as a twig here but I reckon we can afford to use a few matches so s you can find out what you ve got Send it up an I ll soon see if it is the article we ve been hunting for Lower the rope and I ll bring it How far down are you the sailor asked as the match having been consumed he crept toward the aperture I can t tell but it seemed as if I fell a long distance We ll soon find out if you ll give me the chance Nelse paid out on the rope until he was certain not less than fifteen feet had been lowered into what he hoped would prove to be a veritable treasure chamber and then Gil shouted Hold on I ve got enough You ll have to pull me up for I want to come with both hands full Make it fast under your arms and I reckon we ll be able to manage the rest This portion of the work was quickly accomplished and when Gil stood beside his companions the sailor would have lighted another match if the boys had not prevented him Wait until we are at the entrance and then perhaps the same light will show us materials for a torch Nelse said as he seized Gil s arm hurrying him toward the shaft The man who was on watch had heard all the conversation and his excitement was quite as great as that of the others I ve got a piece of paper here an we ll use it to help out with the matches As he and his mate twisted this firmly to prevent it from burning too quickly and then ignited one end Gil held forth the supposed treasure and loud exclamations of joy and surprise burst from the lips of all as they saw what at first glance seemed to be a mass of sparkling fire in the boy s hand They re diamonds Gil cried with yet greater excitement A whole string of them and there must be more that s valuable where these came from Not until the paper had been entirely consumed did either member of the party cease to gaze at the wondrously brilliant gems and then all realized that they had neglected to look for wood with which to make a torch We must use more matches Nelse said breathlessly and if we can t find wood here one must venture out for we re bound to know what is in that hole before morning I reckon we ll stay right in this spot till Jenkins comes back seein s how we re prisoners so long as the rope is at the bottom of the shaft Gil replied grimly but it won t be so very hard to wait now we know the treasure has been found I wonder how much more there is Did you feel anything else It seemed as if there were a lot of packages done up in rotten sail cloth as these were I felt around some but didn t dare to move very much for fear of getting another fall Was the place a regular cave or only a hole I think it s a room built to hide things in for there seemed to be a floor of rock though of course a good deal of earth fell in with me and made it appear as if filled nearly full but I could take several steps in half a dozen directions During this conversation the sailors had ignited another of the precious matches and learned to their great disappointment that there was nothing in the shaft out of which a torch might be made We can afford to wait Gil said philosophically and he had hardly ceased speaking when a low hail from the surface caused all hands to spring to their feet Hello below Everything goin on ship shape Who s there one of the sailors asked cautiously Me Jenkins I only came to see if anything had gone wrong an now I know you re all right I ll do a little more skirmishin I haven t found anything to bring the water in yet Come down first Gil whispered We ve found a lot of diamonds What We ve got fifteen or twenty big diamonds Pass up the rope an be quick about it The sailors did in a few seconds what might have taken the boys a long while to do and Jenkins came down with the greatest possible speed As a matter of course it was necessary to use more matches in order to show him the treasure and he literally gasped with surprise when the glittering gems were held before his eyes Talk about luck boys he cried in delight Why sich a sight as that makes up for the scrape we re in an if it was twice as bad I wouldn t have it changed providin we could get as much more out of the business That old picture amounted to somethin after all didn t it but we might never have read the thing right an it s mighty fortunate them imps forced us to cover Again Gil was forced to repeat his story and when it was concluded the mate insisted on making an examination of the excavation at once There s plenty of time to look for water after we know how much you ve found I d rather see diamonds than drink the best stuff these old pirates ever took on board Get the torch an we ll all go Gil said with a laugh for he felt very jolly despite the enemies who would soon hunt him down now the location of the treasure had been discovered Jenkins climbed to the mouth of the shaft as nimbly as a cat returning a few moments later after having thrown down inflammable material sufficient to provide the party with light for many hours Binding together several pieces of fatty wood and coiling the rope on his arm the mate led the way into the tunnel a short distance where the torch was ignited and the work of searching for the pirates wealth began There was no difficulty in finding the place where Gil had sunk through the bottom of the passage The earth had given way at one side of the tunnel until a hole fully a yard square was formed and peering into this the excited ones could see a small chamber which was evidently hewn from the solid rock The size or shape could not be determined but that made little difference just then so eager were all to know what was concealed beneath You two wait to help us up Jenkins said to the sailors and after we ve had a squint at the place you shall have a chance Will stayin here keep us out of a share of the stuff one of the men asked as if doubtful whether he would be dealt with fairly Not a bit of it Gil replied quickly I suppose you will be satisfied to have father make a division of everything that s found and what he says is fair you shall have We re ready to trust to the captain s way of sizin the thing up I reckon you ll have to be Jenkins growled for when it comes down to what is square neither of us are entitled to anything The picture belonged to the boys an we come here in the captain s employ drawin good wages so the profits of the voyage oughter go to him the same as if the Day Dream had got these diamonds for freightin a cargo But this ain t the same thing as freightin by a long shot was the sulky reply We re on land now an the yacht is at the bottom consequently we re our own masters You won t say that when it comes to a question of drawin wages It ain t any sure thing that we ll be paid for this kind of work Now see here Gil said in a tone of authority we won t have any quarreling Whatever treasure may be found shall benefit all hands in such proportion as father may think best though of course it wouldn t be right to divide it into even shares We don t expect as much as he gets but want a fair divvy the second man said sulkily and the boys understood that the finding of the diamonds had but given them a new cause for anxiety since the sailors made greedy by the sight of the gems might prove worse enemies even than the blacks You heard the promise that Gil made which was more than reasonable considerin they re entitled to everything if the matter should go inter a court of law an now hold your tongues Jenkins said angrily We re standin here fightin when at least one of us should be in the shaft to know if anything is goin on wrong outside an there ll be plenty of time to settle the division part when we ve found all that s below You are takin up more time chinnin than we did the older of the men replied insolently and Gil began to regret having made the discovery so soon Jenkins remained silent a moment as if trying to decide what should be done to check the apparent mutiny before it assumed dangerous proportions and Gil whispered Don t pay any attention to what they say Neither of them will be dissatisfied after father comes no matter how much we may find I was wonderin whether we hadn t better stop the whole thing right here an let the captain He ceased speaking very suddenly for at that instant a shrill cry was heard from the direction of the shaft and Nelse said as he ran forward That was Andy The blacks have got hold of him CHAPTER XXV TO THE RESCUE As the boys started down the tunnel in response to the continued cries for help Jenkins extinguished the torch and caught up the rope He understood that the old cook must have been very near the shaft when he made the frenzied appeal otherwise his voice could not have been heard so distinctly and there was no necessity of letting it be known any one else was in the vicinity Even the sailors eager though they were to share the treasure did not hesitate at first to rush to the rescue and for the time being everything save Andy s danger was forgotten On arriving at the shaft Nelse prudently halted until his companions could join him and Jenkins who arrived a second later whispered Don t even breathe loud There s no tellin where some of them imps may be an as likely as not half a dozen are above there waiting to find out if we are here This injunction was obeyed implicitly until a few moments later when another scream was heard and this time the listeners could hear distinctly the words Gil Nelse Fur de lub ob heaben help de ole man De debbils has done cotched me an I se boun ter be sarved like you se This prayer for aid ended in a smothered groan or shriek as if the speaker s mouth had suddenly been closed against his will and Gil whispered to the mate We mustn t stand still here and let them kill him There s nothin we can do in the darkness an while the whole crowd are most likely layin low in the hope that we ll rush out But remember what he did for us If he hadn t taken some chances then we should have been murdered and it is better for us to run every risk now rather than stay here idle at such a time Jenkins remained silent and motionless for several moments as if studying the situation and then he said speaking slowly and thoughtfully I ll try my hand at helpin the old man providin you boys agree not to leave this place if the blacks succeed in getting hold of me We ll do nothing of the kind Gil replied indignantly It s not likely you ll be able to accomplish very much alone but with all hands we may manage to get the old fellow out of their clutches Surely with the weapons we can make a rush they can t stand That might work if it was daylight but in the night we have no means of knowin where to find the scoundrels But we can t wait until morning Nelse nodded They ll kill him before that time An we shall share the same fate I m afraid Jenkins replied in hopeless tone The sailors had not joined in the conversation but stood a short distance inside the tunnel discussing as the boys believed the situation in cautious whispers Neither Gil nor Nelse proposed to remain idle while one member of the party was in peril even though he had brought the trouble on himself by refusing to remain with the others and the former insisted most peremptorily that the mate decide upon some plan of action in which all could join If you don t we shall go alone for we won t have it to think of that the poor fellow was killed because we refused to help him It ll take half an hour to get out of here now the rope has been pulled down Jenkins said as if on the point of yielding to their demands Then so much the more reason why we should begin without delay Come on Nelse we ll do all that is possible and let the others join us or stay here as they choose As he spoke Gil began to grope around the sides of the shaft in order to select that portion where the earth was packed solidly for the task of cutting his way upward and had dug with his knife a hole for one of his feet when Jenkins approached Now see here boys I m willin to do all I can so there s no use in startin off before you re ready Besides you ll never get out by working in that way Go ahead then show us how and we ll do our share Calling the sailors to him Jenkins mounted on their shoulders which brought his hands within a short distance of the surface and there he stood some moments listening No sound betokened the presence of any of the enemy although there was every reason to suppose one or more might be waiting for just such a move on the part of the white men and then digging his hands and feet into the loose earth the agile mate succeeded in clambering to the top Pass up the rope he whispered and when this was done he directed the boys to tie one end under their arms I ll pull you two up an the others can look out for themselves Bring the revolvers knives an hatchets for I reckon we shall need everything we ve got in the way of weapons The sailors helped the boys secure the rope under their arms and assisted in gathering the articles of defense but when the two had been drawn to the surface the men made no move toward joining them Why don t you come up Jenkins whispered impatiently Cause we ve concluded to stay here This ain t no scrape of ours an seein s we re only foremast hands it s better manners to stay where we are They intend to hunt for the treasure Nelse whispered and Gil replied in the same cautious tone That s a fact but I don t see how we can help ourselves It s better to let them get away with everything than for us to stop here guarding whatever may be in the underground chamber while poor old Andy is being murdered I reckon they won t get very far off if they should try to play us a scurvy trick Jenkins said thus showing that he also was thinking the sailors meditated treachery We ll pass back the rope an make it a reasonably hard job for em to crawl out Then you think they stayed behind to have a look at the place I found Gil said interrogatively Of course why else would they refuse to go with us I knowed trouble was brewin from the way they talked about dividin the stuff an perhaps we ll be gettin out cheap if they take all that s left Have you got the diamonds They are in my breastpocket Then let em go ahead an it ain t no dead certain thing that we won t overhaul em before your father comes back We ve got all the weapons an they ll be in a tight place if the blacks want to make a rush through the tunnel Now that s enough for them an we ll turn our attention to huntin for Andy Foller me an I ll guarantee to find him but whether it ll be possible to do the poor fellow any good is another matter Each of the little party had a revolver and the total number of cartridges was sixteen therefore they could make quite a spirited fight provided it was not prolonged This fact served to give the boys no slight degree of courage and as Jenkins led the way through the underbrush where it was so dark that one could not see objects twenty inches in advance both felt positive the cook would be rescued in time Although Jenkins appeared to be walking at random he was in reality pursuing the most direct course possible for the cave since it was more than probable the prisoner had been taken to that stronghold After half an hour s rapid traveling the mate halted and parting the branches in front of him pointed to the reflection of a fire about fifty yards away That s where we ll find cookee or I m a Dutchman These cattle don t seem to be able to do anything without havin a big blaze to work by an we ve only got to crawl up there in order to see him Go ahead quickly or we may be too late I reckon they ll take plenty of time to carve him up It seems they re countin on catchin the whole of us without much trouble or else some of em would have been hangin around the entrance to the shaft waitin for us to come out Perhaps they didn t know we were there It isn t safe to trust to chances and we ought to end matters as soon as possible Jenkins did not wait to argue further but continued the advance cautiously his companions remaining close behind him until they were where it was possible to see the main body of the enemy The number of the blacks had at least been doubled since the boys saw them last and that they felt perfectly secure from an attack could be told by the fact that all were gathered around an enormous fire without having taken the precaution to post sentinels At the mouth of the big cave tied hand and foot was poor old Andy On either side stood a burly black man whose body was covered with grotesque ornaments and the entire party were waiting in silence for the coming of the old mummers or at least so the boys judged from the expectant manner in which all gazed toward the entrance If we had a hundred rounds of ammunition I wouldn t be afraid to open fire on the crowd this minute an it s ten to one that they d be cleaned out in twenty minutes or made to take to their boats But we haven t got that number of cartridges and it seems to me we had better begin operations mighty soon for it ll be harder after the old fellows are there to urge the rest on Gil suggested and Nelse expressed the same opinion by saying Suppose we make a rush We can fire half a dozen shots at short range and jump in on them while they are in confusion It s takin a big risk Jenkins replied thoughtfully Of course it is but we ve got to run the chances or give up all hopes of doing anything It was only natural for Jenkins to hesitate knowing as he did that Captain Mansfield would hold him responsible if anything happened to the boys while they were thus virtually under his charge but both were so persistent and impatient that he was forced to act upon their suggestion or see them start off alone We ll try it he said with a long drawn breath but remember if anything goes wrong that I advised ag in a battle where we re outnumbered at least ten to one I ll take it on myself to say you shan t be blamed no matter how badly we are beaten Gil replied Now are you ready Yes have your revolvers in hand We ll creep up as near as we can an when I give the signal each must shoot as fast as he can till we ve given em three shots apiece then make a rush for Andy an if we get hold of him make the best time for the shaft That ll draw the whole crowd down on us an we haven t any water but he ll be safe for a while Go ahead we ll follow Move quick for it don t improve a fellow s courage to stand here thinking about what s to be done CHAPTER XXVI A PITCHED BATTLE It was not necessary for the boys to advise Jenkins to move quickly since he was quite as eager as they to have the desperate affair settled That he should feel nervous was not to be wondered at for he realized fully how many chances there were against success and in case of a triumph bought at the expense of a dangerous wound to one or the other of the boys the mate knew only too well that Captain Mansfield would bring him to a rigid accounting This is where I m bound to get the worst of it anyhow he muttered to himself as he crept forward to a cleared spot where it would be possible to use the revolver to advantage an I don t know as it makes much difference how the thing turns out If we get the best of it here we ve got to settle with the sailors who if any amount of treasure has been found will be ripe for mischief Then as if in desperation he leveled his weapon gave the signal for all to be ready and fired three shots in rapid succession The boys followed his example except perhaps that they did not take as careful aim for the idea of shooting with intent to kill at a human being was despite the gravity of the situation something at which their better nature revolted The reports of the weapons rang out in a scattering fashion causing it to sound as if ten instead of three men were firing and as the smoke arose preventing any view of the enemy Jenkins shouted Now for it boys The little party dashed across the cleared space without knowing what effect the bullets had had A cheer went up from Gil as the greater number of the enemy were seen fleeing into the cave each man so determined to gain a place of safety first that the entrance was literally choked and those who were prevented from entering could do no less than turn at bay We ve frightened em too much Jenkins cried as he dashed toward Andy hoping to sever his bonds while the blacks were yet panic stricken and the words were hardly spoken when he found his progress barred by two burly fellows who had come to a halt at the mouth of the cavern where their companions were packed so closely that it was impossible for them to take another step forward Look out for Andy Jenkins cried as he raised his hatchet to ward off a blow aimed at him by a heavy ax I can hold my own here if you ll attend to him The boys were so excited that they hardly heard the words but since both were aiming for the same object the command was involuntarily obeyed Lying prostrate on the ground where he had been overturned by the first frenzied rush the old man was holding up his hands that the bonds might be severed and with one slash of his knife Gil succeeded in cutting the ropes of grass Nelse had fallen over a wounded black as he reached the prisoner s side but he managed to scramble to his feet and sever the remaining bonds before Gil could do anything more and the cook leaped up and seized a huge club from a pile of wood near the fire thus adding one more to the small numbers of the attacking party The boys first impulse was to escape with the rescued man but a glance toward Jenkins told that he was in sore need of assistance and both darted to his side The enemy were so active that the mate had not been able to deal a single blow with any effect and pressed him so hotly that he did not have an opportunity to draw his revolver Shoot that biggest imp he shouted as his friends gained his side I ll attend to the other Gil aimed directly at the fellow s head for it was no time to hesitate about shedding blood but before he could discharge the weapon Andy came to the rescue With one swinging blow of his huge club he sent both the blacks sprawling on the ground and Jenkins shouted as he leaped back Save all your cartridges now an make a dash for the bushes It was quite time the white party beat a retreat for the panic stricken ones had been turned probably by the old men in the cave and were now returning to the fight When they should realize how few were those who made the attack it would hardly be possible to check them and Jenkins only hope was to gain a shelter before this fact was known So far as could be ascertained in this brief interval of time none of the blacks had been killed but several were wounded and these lay on the ground where unless their fear was too great they could see the whites as they ran toward the bushes One of the boldest of those who were returning to the fray ran after the retreating party with an uplifted ax but Jenkins put a bullet through his arm and he fled once more screaming as if in mortal agony toward the cave thus checking the pursuit momentarily It was hardly more than three minutes from the time the first shot was fired before those who had made the brave charge were within shelter of the foliage waiting to regain their breath and the mate said in a tone of deepest relief We ve come out of that mighty lucky and now if we can get to the shaft before they gather their wits there s a chance of pullin through all right but I allow Andy that you re willin to stay with us after this I se boun to do dat but I se gwine ter hol to it dat dere s no use in stoppin whar de hoodoo is mighty strong It wasn t strong enough to prevent us from getting you clear after they had you trussed up like a chicken ready for roasting Gil said grimly panting so hard that he could speak only with difficulty Dat s a fac honey but de charm was wha did de mos ob it You was left alone with your charm and would have been killed if we hadn t followed at risk of our own lives so I don t want to hear any more about that thing Nelse replied sharply If it were of the same power you seem to think there would have been no need of us Dere s some tings it carn t do ob course but when you sees it I se suah you se gwine ter fall right down in sprise Then why didn t you show it to those fellows when they caught you an saved us all this trouble I hadn t de time honey Dey done cum so quick I couldn t mo n wink afore de ropes was woun all ober me You managed to make considerable noise just the same Dat s wha I se boun ter do so s you se would hyar me There s no use arguin with the old fool Jenkins said impatiently We ve got to get back to the shaft an if we don t move mighty lively the whole crowd will be down on us Even in the face of their danger the boys had allowed their thoughts to be occupied with the cook to the exclusion of everything else and now as they gazed toward the fire it could be seen that the blacks were making ready for a regular battle The repulsive looking old men had come from the cave and were now addressing their followers probably for the purpose of inciting them to fight and the more courageous had already advanced toward the thicket as if ready to wreak vengeance Four were receiving considerable attention as their companions bound up the wounds inflicted by the revolvers but none were in such a dangerous condition but that they could give a good account of themselves in the chase which would probably ensue and Jenkins said regretfully We oughter been more careful What they want is a good lesson an if we d succeeded in killin half a dozen the rest wouldn t be so bold We ve done mischief enough Gil said with a shudder and if we can get back to the tunnel it is to be hoped they ll leave us alone That s exactly what they don t intend to do my boy See they are after us hot foot already It was as Jenkins had said The entire crowd were beginning to move down the slope from the cave and there was no longer any hope of being allowed to retire peacefully It has turned into a runnin fight the mate said as he examined his revolver You fellows must start an I ll try to hold em in check a little Then I ll join you an we ll work the same game over again Andy can you lead the way to the shaft I se able ter do dat much Then go and don t wait for me until I ve fired three times After that I shall come on the best I know how The old man started through the underbrush after assuring himself that the boys were close behind and during the next five minutes the three traveled at a rapid pace without hearing the slightest sound from the rear Then came two shots in succession and Gil would have stopped but that the old darky reminded him they should hear another before coming to a halt and in less than a minute the third rang out so near at hand that it seemed as if Jenkins must have been standing close beside them when he fired Where are you Nelse cried and the mate replied Don t speak so loud They are right behind and our only hope is to throw them off the scent or we may not be able to get under cover Even if we gain the shaft it is only a question of being starved out Very true but we can stand considerable hunger an thirst before we ll come out to be killed Now it was Jenkins who led the way and he traveled at full speed until the footsteps of the pursuers could be heard close in the rear when he halted Go on boys I ll try to stop em once more an on the next tack we must sight the shaft or give up all hope of gettin back there Come on chillun Don t stop now when dem debbils are so nigh Andy shouted and in another instant a cry of terror burst from his lips as he ran almost into the arms of a black man The devotees of voudooism were not so dumb as the mate had fancied and instead of following behind a portion had circled around the party thus cutting off the line of the proposed retreat Why don t you go on Jenkins cried angrily Because they have succeeded in surrounding us Gil replied but by no means calmly It s a question of fighting now whether we want to or not Then be careful that every shot tells the mate cried taking no heed of the fact that in the intense darkness it was impossible to do more than fire at random CHAPTER XXVII UNDER COVER In an instant every one of the fugitives realized that perfect silence was of the utmost importance in aiding them to ascertain the location of the enemy and not one moved or spoke during the minute which followed the alarming discovery Then could be heard the stealthy footsteps of those who were tracking them to the death and Jenkins fancied he saw a way out of the dangerous situation Pressing the hand of Nelse who was nearest he intimated that the boy was to follow him and the latter in turn communicated the command by the same means to Gil and Andy The mate s purpose was to steal off at an angle and thus avoid the enemy who was steadily closing in on them for a hand to hand conflict was not to be thought of for a single instant and that was what must come in a very short time unless the pursued could escape the net which was being drawn tighter each moment Stealthily the four crept toward the left advancing slowly but surely each instant until just when all began to fancy the plan might be a success it was Jenkins turn to run plump into the arms of one of the enemy During a few seconds neither of his companions understood why he halted so suddenly nor what caused the unusual rustling among the foliage and then Gil realized more by the sense of touch than of sight that the mate was putting forth all his strength in a struggle for the mastery the loser of which might expect only death For an instant it seemed singular that the black did not summon others to his aid and then Gil learned that the sailor had grasped his adversary by the throat thus preventing him from making any outcry Once this discovery had been made the only question was as to how the mate might be assisted and Gil could think of no way except to seize the man by the legs which he did with such suddenness and strength that the fellow was hurled to the ground his head striking an uncovered root a resounding thump that deprived him of consciousness Now was the time to continue the flight for every second was precious and the little party pushed on through the underbrush at a rate of speed that promised to give them a decided advantage over possible pursuers At the best pace each ran Jenkins leading the way the others following in single file each grasping the clothing of the one in advance that they might not be separated The blows received by coming in contact with the low hanging branches were not noticed in this race for life nor did any heed the dangers that might be encountered by a misstep or a mistake as to the course but all pressed on literally for dear life and when twenty minutes had passed Jenkins paused at the mouth of the shaft Not a sound could be heard to betoken that the enemy were in pursuit and the mate was on the point of whispering to the sailors to pass up the rope when Gil said Here it is made fast to the tree as when we left And they were so crazy about the treasure that it wasn t thought worth while to look out for safety It would have been a nice mess if those imps had come here ahead of us an taken a notion to find the meaning of such a ladder Never mind that now Gil said soothingly as he saw that the mate was likely to linger too long over this neglect of duty Let s get below first and talk about what should have been done afterward Go down I ll wait until you are at the bottom so s to make sure the black villains haven t yet discovered our hiding place Gil swung himself over the edge and allowed the rope to slip slowly through his hands until he reached the bottom Neither of the two men came to ask the result of the foray and he thought with surprise that they must be sleeping It was necessary every member of the party should be on the alert and he went into the tunnel to awaken them feeling around with his hands Nothing could be found It was as if the place had been abandoned Pressing farther in he continued the blind search but without success and finally the truth of the matter flashed upon him Running to the shaft arriving there just as Jenkins descended the others having reached the bottom in safety he said excitedly The sailors have gone to help us and now I suppose we ought to start out to find them though it seems like advertising our whereabouts to the enemy Do you mean that neither of the fellows are here Jenkins asked in surprise Not unless they are in the treasure chamber I went up the tunnel as far as I dared without a light and found it empty I suppose they thought we were getting the worst of it when the firing was heard and wanted to help Not a bit of it the mate said angrily They ve been overhaulin the treasure taken all they could find an now propose to give us the slip It doesn t seem reasonable they would run so many risks just for a little money The chances are that they ve found a good deal and rather than divide or be contented with what the captain might choose to give them have parted company with us That seems like suicide for they can t show themselves when father arrives without giving up what has been carried away Most likely they count on stealin a boat from the blacks an gettin to the mainland but they ll find that a mighty slim chance I wish I had hold of the sneaks for a minute I d show them what it means to play such a trick Don t bother your head about it We are well rid of men who will act like that But they ve made way with all the treasure you discovered most likely and in his anger Jenkins spoke incautiously loud What of it The chances are neither they nor we can leave the island with it and our lives are more precious than all the pirates hoards that were ever buried The mate failed to look at the matter in such a philosophical light and he would have continued to give way to his anger in unmeasured terms if a noise from the entrance had not warned him to be silent Animated by the same thought each member of the party crept to the edge of the shaft and there the hum of voices proclaimed that the secret of their hiding place had been discovered We re under cover now for a fact Jenkins said grimly as the sound of footsteps told that the enemy were moving to and fro evidently for the purpose of examining the surroundings and the worst of it is that we re reg larly shut in till the captain comes back for I ll guarantee that crowd don t leave while we are down here alive Then the sailors are better off than we and have a good chance to get hold of the boats It ain t likely these imps are so careless as to leave the crafts where anybody can get them an we shall have to wait till mornin before knowin who s in the best condition We ll have a few oysters an then try to get a little sleep for there s no danger of an attack between now an daylight I couldn t close my eyes a single minute while that crowd is waiting around to kill us Nelse said with a shudder Don t be so sure lad you ll get used to it in a little while an the need for sleep will come mighty strong before morning Nelse was positive Jenkins spoke at random and he also thought he couldn t eat anything under the circumstances but when his companions attacked the oysters he succeeded in swallowing quite as many as did Gil and even Andy made a hearty supper It was no longer possible to hear any noise from around the mouth of the shaft but the besieged knew beyond a doubt that the enemy were still there and acting upon the mate s suggestion all hands moved a short distance inside the tunnel where they could talk without danger of being overheard As a matter of course every one was anxious to hear the story of Andy s adventures and he was able to tell it in a very few words After refusing to enter the tunnel with the remainder of the party the old man had made his way toward the interior of the island hoping to find a hiding place in some of the trees and succeeded only in losing his way After walking nearly an hour he found himself in sight of the big cave where the blacks were assembled in full force and this so frightened him that he thought only of trying to find his comrades To that end he struck out in the direction where he supposed the shaft to be located and was within a few yards of the desired spot when he was seized by five men From that moment until the revolvers were discharged Andy had no hope anything could be done to aid him and losing faith for the first time in his mysterious charm prepared for death It was evident from the manner of telling the story that he did not care to go into the details after having brought the trouble all on himself and a remark made by Gil relative to the treasure chamber gave him a good excuse for changing the topic of conversation Am it sure dem men took all de gol dere was in de hole he asked and Nelse said with some slight show of enthusiasm What s to prevent us from finding out exactly the condition of affairs We ve got to stay here and an examination of the place will serve to make the time pass more quickly Perhaps we might be needed here suddenly Gil suggested but Jenkins said decidedly I ll guarantee there ll be nothin goin on in this part of the island till sunrise so if you feel disposed to have a look at the place after them scoundrels have got away with the treasure there s nothing to prevent Somebody will have to help us down I wouldn t want to try to lower Nelse alone Andy can attend to that part of the business Let him stand by the rope an in case anything should happen which ain t probable I can pass the word to him Is yer gwine ter keep right on lookin fur de pirates gol the old man asked in evident alarm Yes we want to see if the men have left any Den I stays right hyar We se done had trubble enuff bout dat ar money an I wants ter keep way frum it It was in vain that the boys and Jenkins alternately coaxed and scolded the old fellow positively refused to so much as take a single step into the tunnel and it seemed as if the investigations would necessarily be postponed until a more convenient season CHAPTER XXVIII A SECOND ALARM The old darky s superstitious fears sometimes resembled stubbornness as in this particular case and Gil after exhausting his powers of persuasion without effect said impatiently It s mighty strange that you re always afraid when there s something on hand in the shape of work Cummin to dis yere islan wasn none ob my fixin an ef de captin would er lef me I d done been gone outer de yacht afore she got pas New York Harbor kase I knowed wha was goin ter happen and then Andy relapsed into moody silence The fact that they could not examine the treasure chamber caused the boys the most intense desire to do so and finally Nelse suggested that they try it alone I ll contrive to lower you down Gil an Mr Jenkins can come into the tunnel long enough to help pull you out I ve got a better plan than that the mate said suddenly as a happy thought occurred to him Andy shall stay here to listen for the blacks an I ll bear a hand After you ve been there long enough I can come after you I se willin to stan watch ef all hands wants ter go Andy added gruffly and thus the matter was settled although it would be necessary for Jenkins to remain in the tunnel The old darky seated himself with his back against the side of the shaft a very dangerous position if any of the enemy should descend quickly and the others commenced operations The torches were found in the tunnel where they had been dropped when Andy s cry for help was heard and as he ignited one Jenkins said Now have a good look around boys an make sure them thieves didn t leave anything behind Perhaps there was nothing but the diamonds in the hole Nelse suggested I don t allow pirates would go to the trouble of diggin sich a place for the sake of hidin a little thing like that Have you still got them safe Gil Trust me for that Even while we were stealing up on the enemy I kept feeling in my pocket to make sure they couldn t get lost I allow there s more than enough in them ere stones to pay for the Day Dream an leave some over to tassel our handkerchiefs with Now are you ready While they were speaking Jenkins had been uncoiling the rope and began to fasten one end under Gil s arms as he spoke Then lifting the boy clear from the ground he let him drop slowly to the bottom with the torch in his hand The same operation was repeated with Nelse and the two had ample opportunity to examine the subterranean chamber It had been built with exceeding care The sides which were cut in a coral ledge as was the entire excavation had been chiseled smooth an operation which must have required no slight amount of time and in the roof were what appeared to be two small apertures for the escape of air These details however were not noted by the boys until they had been in the cavern some time Their first and in fact only thought was of the supposed treasure The large amount of earth which had fallen when Gil was precipitated into the chamber covered one end of the apartment entirely and the fact of this having been thrown around considerably told that it had been overhauled to a considerable extent since Gil was drawn up while the fragments of what he believed to be a box were scattered in every direction There s no question but that the men have been here Nelse said sufficiently loud for Jenkins who was lying over the aperture in such a manner that he could both hear and see to distinguish the words Of course they have the mate replied angrily an that s why they wouldn t come with us to help Andy Do you see anything Nothing more than this pile of dirt Gil replied If the spade is in the shaft we might throw it all over an make sure they got everything That s a good idea Wait a minute an I ll fetch it Jenkins face disappeared from the aperture and while he was absent the boys had a good opportunity to survey the singular place In addition to what has already been spoken of they noted with no small degree of surprise that the remains of a stone stairway occupied one corner of the chamber and immediately above it was a portion of a wooden hatch or trapdoor set in the earth by iron bands It was directly in the center of this where the wood had decayed that Gil fell and the wonder was that he did not strike on the steps in which case the mishap might have had a more unpleasant ending All I can say is that the pirates must have had a lot of spare time on their hands if they went to all the trouble necessary to make a place like this just to bury their treasure when it would have been safer buried in the earth where a fellow couldn t fall through by mistake as you did Nelse said laughingly It looks as if some one had the idea of living here Before Gil could reply Jenkins arrived with the spade and he said as the implement was dropped on the loose earth Better make a thorough search boys an if you think the work is likely to be too hard come back an I ll go down We ll attend to it It can t take such a very long time to get at the bottom Gil replied as he began the task During five minutes of rapid work nothing was disclosed but at the end of that time Gil unearthed a bench which had been crushed by the falling earth and after that the discoveries came thick and fast Fragments of chairs a mass of decaying matter which appeared to have been wearing apparel rusty cooking implements and finally in one corner a low writing desk was found As the last mentioned article was unearthed the boys gave vent to a cry of triumph and Gil shouted excitedly Here s where we shall find the gold that the sailors overlooked I reckon you re makin a mistake about that my boy Jenkins replied in a thoughtful tone It looks to me as if this place was used to live in an most likely what treasure the people had who built the place was in the chest you fell on If there were diamonds in it the gold was there to a dead certainty an we shan t see anything more in the way of valuables It won t take long to find out what is in here and Gil struck the ancient desk a heavy blow with the spade causing it to fall in fragments At this instant the torch was extinguished the wood having been consumed and the eager explorers were forced to wait until Jenkins could make and send down another Now they searched carefully among the fragments and the first article found was a metal casket covered with rust and securely locked Here s what we want Gil cried triumphantly as he held it above his head that the mate might have a full view When this is opened we shall see a pile of gold It doesn t appear to be very heavy You re right I never thought of that was the reply in a tone of disappointment and Gil tried in vain to open the box by striking it with the spade Use this and Jenkins threw down one of the hatchets Even with such an effective implement it was not an easy matter to break the casket but the metal finally yielded after repeated blows and the boys gazed at the exposed contents in dismay Instead of treasure they had unearthed nothing more than a lot of time stained documents and Gil was about to throw them away when Jenkins called sharply Pass them up here We ll have a look at the writin first an then ll be plenty of time to say they are worth nothing What else was there in the desk Again the boys resumed the search but it seemed as if all the important contents of the chamber had been exposed to view Several tiny vials some curious instruments which might once have belonged to a surgeon and a package of quills for pens comprised the entire list of articles The loose earth had been examined thoroughly and Gil said with a sigh of disappointment There s no reason why we should stay here any longer It s too hot down here for comfort and we can look at the papers up above where there s more air All right here s the rope Send the iron box first an then I ll pull you out Five minutes later the boys were in the tunnel and since there could be no question but that the sailors had succeeded in getting the greater portion of the treasure the contents of the casket attracted considerable attention Let s go up a long bit where there s no danger the light of the torch can be noticed from the shaft an see what s written on all that paper Gil suggested and Jenkins ran back to tell Andy of the change of position before following the boys to a point within twenty or thirty feet from the stone door which had been discovered some time previous Here the three seated themselves on the ground and the mate was about to take the yellow documents from their long resting place when the torch was suddenly extinguished without apparent cause Nelse was on the point of making some laughing remark when he felt the mate s hand pressed firmly over his mouth and at the same instant a draught of air swept down the passage as if a vent had suddenly been opened Motioning for the boys to follow his example Jenkins rose to his feet and as he did so it was possible to see a tiny thread of light from the end of the tunnel where a moment previous had been only the most profound darkness There was no need now to speculate as to why the torch had been extinguished The blacks had discovered even if they did not know it before that the cave communicated with the tunnel and were about to creep upon the white party hoping to take them by surprise The supreme moment had come and the three who stood in that gloomy place listening for the sounds which should tell that the enemy was advancing knew it was to be a struggle to the finish CHAPTER XXIX IN THE TUNNEL During several moments Jenkins remained motionless as if trying to decide what course to pursue and the boys bent forward in their efforts to hear the first sound which should come from the direction of that ray of light but nothing broke the almost profound silence save their own labored breathing They are goin to take plenty of time about it an we ll do the same Jenkins whispered cautiously with his mouth close to Gil s ear The idiots think the light don t show through an are tryin to find out if we re in the tunnel Well what s to be done We can t stand here till they come Take off your shoes an we ll steal down to the shaft We mustn t make a stand here for it ain t certain a lot of em won t come in from the outside at the same time In their stockinged feet the three crept softly down the passage hugging the left side to avoid being precipitated into the excavation until they arrived at the point where Andy clutching firmly the charm on his bosom was keeping watch In reply to Jenkins whispered questions he declared that nothing larger than a night bird had moved in the vicinity and on being told of what was occurring at the opposite end of the tunnel would have leaped to his feet with a cry of alarm but for the firm hold the mate had upon him Sit still an keep your wits about you while I creep back a short distance the latter whispered If you make a noise or try to kick up any bobbery because you don t like our way of managin things I ll shoot you as quick as I would one of them voudoo dancin black men This threat was sufficient to reduce Andy to a state of complete submission but it destroyed his usefulness as a watcher for he was no longer in a frame of mind where he could distinguish between a genuine noise and his own imagination Be ready to shoot the first heathen who shows his head the mate said to Gil and then he disappeared in the tunnel It was useless to expect any assistance from Andy and the boys stood at the foot of the shaft listening intently with their revolvers ready for use but nothing save the sighing of the night wind among the foliage came to their ears The mate moved as noiselessly as a shadow and the silence was almost terrifying The minutes passed like hours fearing as the boys did that each instant would come the sounds of conflict proclaiming that they must begin the struggle for life and fully half an hour had passed before Jenkins appeared saying in a low hurried tone as he stood beside Gil and Nelse They have started I counted six before the door was closed an they ll be here in about five minutes Our best plan is to hug the wall of the shaft close by the entrance to the tunnel an wait till they are at close range when every shot will count We ll do whatever you think best Gil replied nervously and the mate continued We can t fight very long with the small number of cartridges so each one must bring down a man If the fellows from the top join in as I reckon they re bound to do keep far enough inside to prevent them from seeing the flash of the powder an take to your hatchets when the last shot has been fired It s better to die here fightin than allow ourselves to be taken prisoners for their pleasure We ll do our share Gil said and now I shan t hesitate to try to kill a human being It s your life or theirs an you d be foolish to have any scruples now I ve brought the iron box here in case there should be a chance of gettin out of this place but I don t s pose we ll have any call for it because there are too many blacks for us to get the best of in a fair fight Jenkins ceased speaking very suddenly for at that moment a rustling of the leaves was heard from the top of the shaft and all expected the onslaught would be made at once Even Andy understood it was a question of fighting and that his charm would not avail him at such a time therefore he joined the defenders although he had no weapon One two three minutes passed and to the boys it seemed as if every drop of blood in their bodies was literally boiling with excitement Their mouths became parched and each tried in vain to moisten his burning lips as he mentally braced himself for the coming struggle The suspense was worse than reality and only with the greatest difficulty could Gil prevent himself from shrieking to break the awful silence Five minutes more passed and it seemed as if fully half an hour must have elapsed when the little party were absolutely electrified by hearing a blood curdling cry from the forest which was echoed and re echoed by the trees until one could have sworn a hundred men were in their last agonies Almost at the same instant the sound of footsteps came from the tunnel and before the boys could draw their weapons it was succeeded by a cry of distress from a dozen throats Then all was still once more Nelse turned toward Jenkins as if to ask whether this had simply been a trick of the imagination and then came a cry of terror from the tunnel repeated again and again until the air was filled with the hideous noise What it could mean no one knew and as Andy cowered in mortal terror against the side of the shaft Jenkins saw a human form outlined upon the lighter darkness of the opening Raising his revolver he fired and a heavy body fell to the ground almost at their feet What is the matter Gil asked unable longer to remain silent I m blest if I know Anyhow here s one of the villains an what s worse he ain t dead Again a tumult in the tunnel was heard and Nelse cried The fellows who were trying to surprise us have fallen into the underground chamber So much is certain but what s the meaning of that and he stopped for an instant as the shrieks from the forest rang out again in such a tone of agony there could no longer be any question that a human soul was being sent to its final account The terrifying cries died away in the distance even as the little party listened and once more silence reigned save when the wounded mass of humanity gave vent to a groan Unless one believed in voudooism as did Andy everything was incomprehensible and even the old darky could think of no satisfactory explanation just at this moment for he cowered close to the others shaking like one in an ague fit and clutching with the strength of despair at the mysterious something concealed beneath his shirt One two three minutes more passed and then Jenkins said with a long drawn breath I can t stand this sort of thing any longer boys We re bound to find out what s been goin on an the facts can t be any worse than a fellow s imagination as he stands here shiverin The boys would have followed him as he went into the tunnel but he prevented them by saying Stay here an keep a mighty sharp watch Nobody knows but that all this yellin was done to throw us off our guard I m certain those noises couldn t have been made for effect an you ll find a whole crowd in the place where the diamonds came from Nelse replied in a decided tone Then all the more reason why some one should be there to prevent them from crawlin out I can take care of a good many if they re in that trap but we are bound to watch out for all the chances Jenkins was so reckless as to light a match before he was more than a dozen feet inside the tunnel and a moment after the boys saw a glow telling that he had ignited one of the torches From the outside not a sound came and in a few seconds the boys heard the mate s cheery cry You were right Nelse The whole boilin of em are in here like rats an believe I m goin to kill em Can you see them Gil asked in surprise Of course I can as well as if the whole lot were on exhibition in a dime museum One of you come here an take a peep for there s no question now but that some of their plans have gone wrong Nelse ran into the tunnel in response to this invitation and on reaching the hole saw seven black forms crouching at the bottom in deepest terror while Jenkins was amusing himself by walking around the edge of the excavation throwing the light on the huddling mass and threatening the poor wretches with what he proposed doing when it should be convenient Do you think it is just safe to stand here while more of the party can jump in on you by the same way these came Nelse asked and this question put a very sudden end to the mate s sport Wait while I have a look around he said as he handed the torch to the boy and disappeared in the darkness Before Nelse could explain the cause of his delay to Gil the mate returned saying in a tone of satisfaction They ve shut the door tight to keep us out in case these fellows failed I reckon an it won t be a bad idea for me to keep watch there while you an Gil divide the work here We must stop any nonsense at the beginnin an then they can t get the upper hands of us Is there a real necessity of watching this crowd Of course otherwise they could soon manage to wriggle out by climbin on each other s shoulders Stand by and shoot the first who rises to his feet Jenkins replied and then he added in a stern tone to the trembling blacks as if believing they could understand him Don t you so much as move or we ll kill the whole boilin the same as we would mosquitoes Lay down an the first one who raises his head shall serve as an example for the rest It was evident that the fellows understood the purport of his words for they crouched yet lower and he added to Nelse Don t hesitate to shoot if they make any show of tryin to get out for our lives depend upon holdin the whole crowd You ought to tell Gil where I am He s got sense enough to know that at such a time as this he must remain at his post so do as I tell you an don t take your eyes off the gang for a single minute CHAPTER XXX THE STORY Nelse did as he was bidden but while standing at the edge of the excavation holding the torch in one hand and his revolver in the other he could not fail to realize how quickly the tables might be turned if the blacks should make a combined dash That which held them in subjection was the fact that the walls of the underground chamber were so high they could not gain the floor of the tunnel without climbing on each other s shoulders and while this was being done the sentinel would have ample opportunity to shoot with reasonable accuracy of aim Meanwhile Gil was straining his ears for the repetition of that fearful noise which had literally caused the blood to chill in his veins and Andy remained crouching within the shadow of the tunnel busily engaged in executing a series of wonderful contortions evidently intended as an incantation to weaken the power of the voudoo worshipers During fully half an hour matters remained in this condition not a sound save the usual night noises of the forest breaking the silence and then the old darky his alleged spell having been wrought came toward Gil as he said I se gwine ter take my trick at standin watch an you se kin fin de odders It won t take much hunting to do that for I reckon they are guarding the other end of the tunnel but if you can attend to matters here for a while I ll be glad to see how things are getting on I se done gone fixed myself was the grave reply and Gil naturally came to the conclusion that the fixing was neither more nor less than those wonderful contortions in which the old darky had been indulging Nelse was more than pleased at seeing his friend for the mental strain of watching over so many of the enemy was beginning to tell upon him and what seemed more important the torch was nearly consumed Stand here a while and I ll make another he said glad of any excuse which should take him from the chamber with its frightened cowering occupants and Gil readily agreed to shoulder the responsibility To recount all that took place on this eventful night would be tedious It suffices to say that a strict watch was kept at each point from which danger might be anticipated and when morning came every member of the party felt thoroughly worn out and exhausted Jenkins had but little fear an attack would be made during the day except it might be from the farther end of the tunnel and proposed to run the risk of this by withdrawing the sentinel from that point and stationing him at the underground chamber where his duty would be to stand watch over the entire tunnel In that way we shall all get a chance to sleep which is what we re needin mighty bad an I ll take the first trick Andy shall stay near the shaft an you boys are to have a good two hour snooze It strikes me that the torches won t hold out a great while longer Nelse said as he looked ruefully at the small supply of wood which had diminished rapidly since the blacks were caught in the trap We won t worry about that Time enough when we ve used the last one The important thing is to get some rest an I want you boys to begin without delay so s Andy an I can have our turn Despite the fact that they had thought it would be impossible to close their eyes in slumber while in a situation of such peril the boys had hardly stretched themselves out on the floor of the tunnel before they were sleeping soundly Not until three hours later did either awaken and then the mate aroused them with a cheery cry of All hands on deck To their great surprise they saw the shaft comfortably full of black men and Jenkins said in reply to their questions Andy an I did that while you were snoring We found out that the fellows in the treasure chamber could understand a kind of lingo he talks an then we made em know what was wanted We brought em up here one by one after tyin the hands of each with that string piece he wore around his waist an now they re quiet an harmless as lambs None of em dares to wink very hard an we can do all the watchin at this place Ain t you afraid they will make a sudden rush Nelse asked thinking it anything rather than safe to allow the fellows so near Not while their hands are tied an one of us manages to keep awake They know what the result will be if any of em so much as moves his head the wrong way an I reckon they ll stay quiet enough But what about the door at the other end of the tunnel I m takin my chances on that cause we ve dug away the earth at the top of the treasure chamber an it ll be a mighty smart darky who can crawl along there without tumblin in seein s they can t afford to bring a light with em You see this does away with the trouble about torches an I ll admit that I don t know how we could a got more when these were used up Now I m goin to take about forty winks Andy has been right there for the last hour so you can turn him out for the next trick As he lay down Jenkins motioned toward the mouth of the tunnel where the cook was sleeping with his huge mouth opened to its widest extent and it seemed to the boys as if the former had but just stretched himself out when he was aiding Andy in the snoring concert Some of the prisoners had so far recovered from their fears as to be able to indulge in slumber and those who remained awake were doing their best to convince the watchers that their intentions were peaceable Although the situation was decidedly improved from what it had been when the boys lay down it was yet far from being reassuring and not until ten minutes or more had passed did they feel at all comfortable in mind Then Gil said as he saw the iron casket lying near the entrance where Jenkins had placed it for safe keeping I think it s about time we examined those documents You keep your eyes on the fellows an I ll find out what s written there Go ahead but I don t believe you ll have much luck for most likely it s in French or Spanish an we ain t very well posted in those languages although we might have been by studying a little harder It s English Gil exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction as he drew the stained documents from their long resting place and forced to use the greatest caution in opening them lest the paper brittle with age should be destroyed If you read it go on an I ll keep my eyes on this crowd of very interesting young gentlemen Nelse said as he settled himself into a more comfortable position for listening and displayed his revolver ostentatiously The writing is plain enough except in places where the ink has faded and I reckon I can get through with it so here goes for the first sheet How many are there Seven or eight but the most of them appear to be memoranda of business transactions for all except the first are covered with figures It starts off like a will I Nissage Boyer native of France and adopted citizen of the United States owner of the finest plantation on the island of Hayti and lessee of the government forest containing the most valuable dye wood deposit here a memoranda of my possessions in case I should never succeed in leaving this place alive hoping it may fall into the hands of my family who fortunately are now safe in New York During the past year I have done my best to keep out of political entanglements but Soulouque who capers like a crowned monkey under his borrowed name of Faustin I has laid many traps some of which I have fallen into and in order to retain possession of my property and at the same time send my family to a place of safety I bound myself to his falling fortunes Now in the year I find myself threatened both by the emperor and insurgents Trying to serve two masters I have fallen to the ground and am a fugitive trusting to the fidelity of my slaves and seeking an opportunity to set sail for the United States Condemned to death by both parties I should have been executed several days ago but for some of my negroes who aided me to reach this island where I fitted up a place of refuge in the year Soulouque declared himself emperor knowing full well that the evil times would soon come and hoping this might serve as a hiding place for my dear ones The shaft the tunnel and the main cave were probably built by the buccaneers who settled here in but the voudoo worshipers have made the island their abiding place so long that none of the negroes and few white men care to visit it Protected by these same voudoo priests who have always done all in their power to frighten their countrymen away from this place I am awaiting the arrival of a fisherman s vessel which should be here in a week at the outside unless the situation at the capital becomes so grave that all the sailing crafts will be seized by the alleged emperor or the so called insurgents I have succeeded in bringing away the most valuable of my personal property and in addition a necklace of diamonds for which I sold the contents of a warehouse taking them in exchange since gold is not readily gotten hold of without exciting suspicion that the owner wishes to leave the island The stones together with as much money as I have been able to secrete will remain in this subterranean chamber Look here Nelse cried interrupting Gil according to what you ve been reading we haven t found any pirates treasure but something for which an owner may appear at any moment That s just the size of it and when we give up the diamonds we sha n t be able to account very satisfactorily for what the sailors stole Our story will seem rather fishy I m afraid but let s find out the balance of this communication and then we shall know better what must be done Are we to give up all hope of coming at the gold which is described by the chart I think we may as well own up that it is a failure but we can tell after I The conversation was interrupted by a noise from the outside and springing to his feet Gil went toward the edge of the shaft arriving there just as a shower of missiles descended Standing near the edge of the shaft as he did Gil escaped a blow but the prisoners were hit freely and they set up such an outcry as caused Jenkins and Andy to spring to their feet very suddenly CHAPTER XXXI AN OPPORTUNE ARRIVAL It was several seconds before the mate understood what had happened and then realizing that the enemy was making an attack he shouted as he darted into the tunnel Keep your eyes open boys for it s certain they ll try to take us from both sides at the same time I reckon you and I had better hold on here Gil said to Nelse There s mighty little use rushing into a place where you can t see a thing and unless we look sharp the whole crowd will be in from this end Andy remained motionless and for this he could not be blamed very severely since he had no weapons with which to defend himself therefore he would only be in the way of the others in case a hand to hand fight ensued Stones fragments of trees and even earth were thrown in from the top of the shaft the enemy remaining concealed from the view of those at the bottom meanwhile until the prisoners succeeded in making their friends understand that no damage was being done to the white party and then the attack ceased at this point From the tunnel the boys could hear a medley of sounds but since there was no report of firearms they rightly concluded that the danger was not sufficiently great to warrant Jenkins in making his presence known What is going on in there Gil shouted after five minutes passed and the din had not subsided The whole boilin of em have struck the trap an are flounderin around in great style the mate replied Are you all right out there The blacks can t do anything without inflicting the most damage on their friends and since understanding that fact have been quiet There s nothing to fear here for a while so if you need one of us I ll come I reckon this end of the fight is takin care of itself but we re shut in now an can count on starvin or surrender Up to this moment the boys had been so interested in the manuscript found in the so called treasure chamber that they had forgotten both thirst and hunger but now they began to realize there was nothing in the way of provisions and what was worse yet not a drop of water had been procured I wish he hadn t said anything about it Nelse whispered for now I begin to feel as if I must have a drink You ll have to take it out in feeling for a while because it would be the height of folly to venture away from this place until father comes And that may not be for a week It can t be helped unless Unless what Nelse asked eagerly as Gil hesitated I fancied for a minute that we might possibly make a trade with these fellows How would it do to tell them they might go if their friends would bring us water and food It isn t probable they d agree to it I reckon they are like almost everybody else and would do a good deal to save their own lives That is true and it couldn t do any harm to try the scheme although I don t believe it will amount to anything but it s only fair Jenkins should know what we intend to do Go up the tunnel and ask him what he thinks of the plan I ll stay here on watch and if he agrees we can make Andy do the talking Nelse ran into the passage returning a few moments later as he said Mr Jenkins is willing we should try to make the trade but he don t believe it can be done How are things in there The fellows tumbled into the hole but there were so many that all but two managed to get out and the chances are they ll be more careful in the future Does Jenkins think there will be another attack He says they re bound to starve us out for it must be known how easily that can be done Is he holding the two who are in the hole There s no need for him to do anything since the fellows can t get out an we ve got such a small number of cartridges that it would be foolish to shoot at men who are unable to do any mischief Then there s no reason why we shouldn t try my plan Here Andy talk to these fellows The old darky came forward very unwillingly and Gil explained the offer he wanted to make I se boun to tell em honey but it won t do the leastest mite ob good Go ahead and we ll soon find out what they think of it At all events there ll be no great amount of harm done Andy did as he was bidden and after a long conversation during which it seemed as if both the interpreter and the prisoners had considerable difficulty in understanding what was said the blacks hailed those on the outside Then no slight amount of talking ensued the men on the surface keeping themselves securely hidden and at the close Andy was called upon once more to learn the result of the interview Dey say how dey ain got anything to do dis yere bizziness the old man replied after a painful effort to understand the prisoners but some ob de gang am gone to fin out ef it kin be fixed You won t get any water that I ll guarantee Jenkins said as he emerged from the tunnel They have gone to talk with the old men an them fellers ain t sich fools as not to know it ll only be necessary to wait twenty four hours before our jig is up Why did you leave the tunnel Gil asked in surprise Because there s no use in staying there any longer They ve given up tryin to come in by that way an in a few minutes the bosses of this ere fun will know jest how we re situated Then you believe I did wrong in proposing to make the trade No I don t It can make mighty little difference to us just now an there was no harm to try During the next five minutes the little party remained in almost perfect silence each one thinking over the situation until all understood how futile would be their struggles unless Captain Mansfield returned very shortly and then came a hail from the outside which was answered by one of the prisoners A short conversation ensued and when it was ended Andy stepped forward to act as interpreter One of the prisoners spoke at some length and then the old darky said hesitatingly Dey says ef we se willin for to come out as prisoners dey ll gib us all we se wants but dere won t be any water sent down hyar Ef you se gwine ter make any bargain Marse Jenkins don koun me in kase I knows wha dese fellers am boun ter do ef dey gits de chance Don t you worry Andy we haven t the slightest idea of acceptin any such temptin offer Tell that feller to say to the others we re goin to stay right where we are an some of this crowd will be sorry before the row is ended Say that if any attack is made on us we shall feel obliged to defend ourselves by shooting the prisoners Gil added hoping the threat might frighten the leaders but by no means intending to carry it into execution The old darky did as he was bidden and during the next five minutes a most exciting conversation followed between those above and the ones below but it finally ceased and Andy seated himself in the tunnel once more this time taking good care to keep well out of range as he said Dat ends de tork an now dey s countin on windin dis yere bizziness up mighty quick Do you know what they mean to do Jenkins asked Nebber a word but one ob de rascals said dey d hab us outer hyar right soon They had better begin now for we shall need a pile of drivin before agreein to give ourselves up to sich a gang Jenkins said as he flourished his revolver but the look on his face belied the words for he understood only too well how soon the struggle must be ended and had no hope Captain Mansfield could return in time to aid them The hour which followed was passed almost in perfect silence Each member of the party had bitter food for reflection and all knew how soon they would be overpowered in case the enemy made a vigorous attack The one question which troubled them all was as to which quarter the next move might be expected from and the boys were quite certain the blacks would confine themselves to the tunnel since there they could at least enter without exposing themselves to the fire from the revolvers I believe they ll do Gil ceased speaking very suddenly as a thin thread of blue smoke came curling down the passage and his eyes involuntarily sought Jenkins That s the size of it the mate exclaimed as he leaped to his feet They ve hit on a plan that ll do us up in a little while without our bein able to stop it You mean they re going to smoke us out Of course can t you see the plan has already been begun We shall have to stay in the shaft an from the top they ll accomplish their work regardless of what we may do to the prisoners Even while Jenkins was speaking the smoke increased in volume and before five minutes passed all the party were standing at the entrance of the tunnel trying to free their eyes and lungs from the stifling vapor There they come Nelse cried and at that instant half a dozen spearlike clubs were thrown two of them striking so near Jenkins that the sleeve of his coat was torn into shreds Without stopping to think that they might need the cartridges more at some future time Gil discharged two barrels of his revolver at random and in reply came more missiles one of which knocked Andy senseless Both the boys would have sprung to his side but that the mate restrained them as he said sharply There s no time to attend to him we ve got to look out for ourselves an it s time something At that instant a loud cheer unmistakably from the throats of white people was heard and Jenkins cried excitedly Here comes the captain I know that shout but I m blest if I understand how he could have got here so quick Now we shall see the imps take to their heels an I d like to have a chance to help them along Before he could say anything more Gil saw his father s face peering over the edge of the shaft and the revulsion of feeling from such a depth of despair to that of certainty his troubles were at an end caused him to reel and relapse into a state of semi unconsciousness which was not very far removed from a veritable fainting spell CHAPTER XXXII THE DEPARTURE In the shortest possible space of time the entire situation was changed Captain Mansfield was accompanied by half a dozen men all fully armed and they at once proceeded to help the little party out of the shaft Andy being the first who was sent to the surface The old darky revived before he was fairly drawn up and the fact that he was no longer in any danger caused him to forget his injuries in the joyful knowledge How did you get here so soon Jenkins asked after the captain had welcomed the boys We fell in with a trading schooner and came directly back for somehow I had an idea that you might be in trouble But where are the rest of the party Gil told in the fewest words possible of what had happened and showed the diamonds in proof Jenkins adding to the story They re hangin round here somewhere an all I ask is the chance to have it out with them before we leave You shall have the opportunity if we fall in with them but I don t propose to stay here any longer than is absolutely necessary After you have had something to eat we ll go on board the schooner and read the remainder of the story Gil insisted on releasing the prisoners before starting for the beach and the poor wretches manifested the greatest surprise at being allowed to go free when they had fully expected to be killed They stopped not on the order of their going but rushed through the tunnel regardless of the smoke and a few seconds later their outcries told that they had fallen into the underground chamber for the second time Let them alone Jenkins said with a laugh I ll guarantee they manage to get out after we leave an it won t do em any harm to flounder round a little while Captain Mansfield was in too much of a hurry to allow the rescued party to linger very long near the scene of their misadventures but hurried them away after the broken casket had been brought from the shaft much to the delight of Andy who said gleefully as he clutched firmly the mysterious something beneath his shirt De cham hab done gone worked hissef out at las jes as I knowed it would but dem debbils don ketch dis yere nigger ergin kase I se gwine ter stick mighty clus to de vessel arter dis What a relief it was to find themselves in a stanch boat manned by a full crew and heading for a trim looking schooner It seemed to the boys as if the sky had never been so blue the water so sparkling nor the air so balmy as on this day while they were being rowed to the vessel Captain Mansfield had chartered Then how good the water tasted At another time they might have found fault with the flavor but now it seemed simply delicious and the boys devoured the hard ship s biscuit as if they were the lightest and sweetest of Andy s productions When the little party had refreshed themselves and were able to realize that they had really been saved from a horrible death Captain Mansfield said as he took the manuscript from the shattered casket I will see if there is anything here which should be attended to before we leave and if not the schooner shall be gotten under way at once You promised to give me a chance at them thieves Jenkins said quickly You shall have it never fear providing the business can be settled before dark Then the captain turned his attention to the manuscript and read in a low tone after glancing over that portion which has already been given The stones together with as much money as I have been able to secrete will remain in this subterranean chamber in case anything should happen to me and I have no fear the blacks will betray the whereabouts of the hiding place since they are only too eager to invest every portion of the island with mystery Whether this story will ever be read I know not but in case it is found I implore whoever peruses it to cause search to be made for my family The gold and plate will be sufficient to pay all necessary expenses and I pray the diamonds may be given to my wife together with the accompanying memoranda of the property I own in or near the capital That completed the story There was no name signed to it neither were there any hints as to how the members of his family might be found but Captain Mansfield said as he assured himself there was nothing more connected with the unfortunate man s history in the casket If his wife or children are yet alive we should be able to trace them by giving the outlines of this story to the different newspapers And we shall have no treasure after finding one Gil added mournfully It should be sufficient to pay you for all the labor and pain that you will be able to relieve the wants of those who own the jewels providing they are in distress It is now quite important those sailors should be overhauled for they must have carried away a reasonably large amount of gold which must be recovered Shall I go ashore sir Jenkins asked Yes but come back as soon as possible for we want to sail while this wind holds Neither the boys nor Andy cared to accompany the mate but he had quite a large following in the crew of the schooner all of whom were eager to join in the search It had been expected Jenkins would be absent a long while but to the surprise of all he returned in less than an hour bringing two packages in baskets of grass Did you find the men Gil cried impatient to learn the news and not willing to wait until the boat came alongside We found where they had been The screams you heard last night while the blacks were coming through the tunnel were their death cries Have they been killed Nelse asked in tones of horror We discovered their bodies not a hundred yards from the mouth of the shaft and in the thicket near by was the stuff they had stolen By this time the boat was alongside and Jenkins passed over the rail the remainder of the treasure consisting of silver plate and gold coin of considerable value Did you meet any of the blacks Captain Mansfield asked No sir I wanted to have one more brush with em but you spoke about bein in a hurry so I thought it wouldn t pay And you did quite right Swing the boat inboard boys and we will be off Half an hour later the island looked to Gil and Nelse like nothing more than a small cloud on the surface of the water and the venturesome cruise was really at an end for before the sun rose again the schooner arrived at a Cuban port from which a freight steamer was on the eve of sailing for New York The journey home was decidedly uneventful after the many stirring adventures through which Gil and Nelse had passed and it is well to bid them adieu as they greet the loved ones once more To day if they are reading this story imperfectly told though it is they will be able to verify all which is here set down and can add for the information of those who may be interested that the Day Dream is afloat Not the one which was sunk off Pearl Point but a new and even more speedy yacht and she is commanded as may be imagined by Job Jenkins while the captain of the galley is the same Andrew Jackson Washington Storts who wore the mysterious charm which the boys were so eager to see and which he still cherishes as something of the utmost value and power Was the real owner of the treasure ever found Indeed she was and never was money more needed than by the unhappy man s wife who was in deepest distress when she chanced to see the advertisements Captain Mansfield had caused to be inserted in the daily papers The value of the diamonds was sufficient to place her beyond want in a pecuniary sense and both Gil and Nelse are more proud of the gold watches presented by the old lady in token of her gratitude than they could possibly have been if the venturesome cruise had ended with the discovery of the buccaneers treasure THE BOYS OWN LIBRARY Handsomely Bound in Cloth Price cents per Volume

Frederick Watts was born on rd February His whole rise and career synchronizes roughly with the rise and career of the nineteenth century As a rule no doubt such chronological parallels are peculiarly fanciful and unmeaning Nothing can be imagined more idle in a general way than talking about a century as if it were some kind of animal with a head and tail instead of an arbitrary length cut from an unending scroll Nor is it less erroneous to assume that even if a period be definitely vital or disturbing art must be a mirror of it the greatest political storm flutters only a fringe of humanity poets like bricklayers work on through a century of wars and Bewick s birds to take an instance have the air of persons unaffected by the French Revolution But in the case of Watts there are two circumstances which render the dates relevant The first is that the nineteenth century was self conscious believed itself to be an idea and an atmosphere and changed its name from a chronological almost to a philosophical term I do not know whether all centuries do this or whether an advanced and progressive organ called The Eleventh Century was ever in contemplation in the dawn of the Middle Ages But with us it is clear that a certain spirit was rightly or wrongly associated with the late century and that it called up images and thoughts like any historic or ritual date like the Fourth of July or the First of April What these images and thoughts were we shall be obliged in a few minutes and in the interests of the subject to inquire But this is the first circumstance which renders the period important and the second is that it has always been so regarded by Watts himself He more than any other modern man more than politicians who thundered on platforms or financiers who captured continents has sought in the midst of his quiet and hidden life to mirror his age He was born in the white and austere dawn of that great reforming century and he has lingered after its grey and doubtful close He is above all things a typical figure a survival of the nineteenth century It will appear to many a somewhat grotesque matter to talk about a period in which most of us were born and which has only been dead a year or two as if it were a primal Babylonian empire of which only a few columns are left crumbling in the desert And yet such is in spirit the fact There is no more remarkable psychological element in history than the way in which a period can suddenly become unintelligible To the early Victorian period we have in a moment lost the key the Crystal Palace is the temple of a forgotten creed The thing always happens sharply a whisper runs through the salons Mr Max Beerbohm waves a wand and a whole generation of great men and great achievement suddenly looks mildewed and unmeaning We see precisely the same thing in that other great reaction towards art and the vanities the Restoration of Charles II In that hour both the great schools of faith and valour which had seemed either angels or devils to all men the dreams of Strafford and the great High Churchmen on the one hand the Moslem frenzy of the English Commons the worship of the English law upon the Illustration THE RIDER ON THE WHITE HORSE other both seemed distant and ridiculous The new Cavalier despised the old Cavalier even more than he despised the Roundhead The last stand of English chivalry dwindled sharply to the solitary figure of the absurd old country gentleman drinking wine out of an absurd old flagon The great roar of Roundhead psalms which cried out that the God of Battles was loose in English meadows shrank to a single snuffle The new and polite age saw the old and serious one exactly as we see the early Victorian era they saw it that is to say not as splendid not as disastrous not as fruitful not as infamous not as good or bad but simply as ugly Just as we can see nothing about Lord Shaftesbury but his hat they could see nothing about Cromwell but his nose There is no doubt of the shock and sharpness of the silent transition The only difference is that accordingly as we think of man and his nature according to our deepest intuitions about things we shall see in the Restoration and the fin de si cle philosophy a man waking from a turbid and pompous dream or a man hurled from heaven and the wars of the angels G F Watts is so deeply committed to and so unalterably steeped in this early Victorian seriousness and air of dealing with great matters that unless we sharply apprehend that spirit and its difference from our own we shall misunderstand his work from the outset Splendid as is the art of Watts technically or obviously considered we shall yet find much in it to perplex and betray us unless we understand his original theory and intention a theory and intention dyed deeply with the colours of a great period which is gone The great technical inequalities of his work its bursts of stupendous simplicity in colour and design its daring failures its strange symbolical portraits all will mislead or bewilder if we have not the thread of intention In order to hold that we must hold something which runs through and supports as a string supports jewels all the wars and treaties and reforms of the nineteenth century There are at least three essential and preliminary points on which Watts is so completely at one with the nineteenth century and so completely out of accord with the twentieth that it may be advisable to state them briefly before we proceed to the narrower but not more cogent facts of his life and growth The first of these is a nineteenth century atmosphere which is so difficult to describe that we can only convey it by a sort of paradox It is difficult to know whether it should be called doubt or faith For if on the one hand real faith would have been more confident real doubt on the other hand would have been more indifferent The attitude of that age of which the middle and best parts of Watts work is most typical was an attitude of devouring and concentrated interest in things which were by their own system impossible or unknowable Men were in the main agnostics they said We do not know but not one of them ever ventured to say We do not care In most eras of revolt and question the sceptics reap something from their scepticism if a man were a believer in the eighteenth century there was Heaven if he were an unbeliever there was the Hell Fire Club But these men restrained themselves more than hermits for a hope that was more than half hopeless and sacrificed hope itself for a liberty which they would not enjoy they were rebels without deliverance and saints without reward There may have been and there was something arid and over pompous about them a newer and gayer philosophy may be passing before us and changing many things for the better but we shall not easily see any nobler race of men and of them all most assuredly there was none nobler than Watts If anyone wishes to see that spirit he will see it in pictures painted by Watts in a form beyond expression sad and splendid Hope that is dim and delicate and yet immortal the indestructible minimum of the spirit Love and Death that is awful and yet the reverse of horrible The Court of Death that is like a page of Epictetus and might have been dreamt by a dead Stoic these are the visions of that spirit and the incarnations of that time Its faith was doubtful but its doubt was faithful And its supreme and acute difference from most periods of scepticism from the later Renaissance from the Restoration and from the hedonism of our own time was this that when the creeds crumbled and the gods seemed to break up and vanish it did not fall back as we do on things yet more solid and definite upon art and wine and high finance and industrial efficiency and vices It fell in love with abstractions and became enamoured of great and desolate words The second point of rapport between Watts and his time was a more personal matter a matter more concerned with the man or at least the type but it throws so much light upon almost every step of his career that it may with advantage be suggested here Those who know the man himself the quaint and courtly old man down at Limnerslease know that if he has one trait more arresting than another it is his almost absurd humility He even disparages his own talent that he may insist rather upon his aims His speech and gesture are simple his manner polite to the point of being deprecating his soul to all appearance of an almost confounding clarity and innocence But although these appearances accurately represent the truth about him though he is in reality modest and even fantastically modest there is another element in him an element which was in almost all the great men of his time and it is something which many in these days would call a kind of splendid and inspired impudence It is that wonderful if simple power of preaching of claiming to be heard of believing in an internal message and destiny it is the audacious faculty of mounting a pulpit Those would be very greatly mistaken who misled by the childlike and humble manner of this monk of art expected to find in him any sort of doubt or any sort of fear or any sort of modesty about the aims he follows or the cause he loves He has the one great certainty which marks off all the great Victorians from those who have come after them he may not be certain that he is successful or certain that he is great or certain that he is good or certain that he is capable but he is certain that he is right It is of course the very element of confidence which has in our day become least common and least possible We know we are brilliant and distinguished but we do not know we are right We swagger in fantastic artistic costumes we praise ourselves we fling epigrams right and left we have the courage to play the egoist and the courage to play the fool but we have not the courage to preach If we are to deliver a philosophy it must be in the manner of the late Mr Whistler and the ridentem dicere verum If our heart is to be aimed at it must be with the rapier of Stevenson which runs us through without either pain or puncture It is only just to say that good elements as well as bad ones have joined in making this old Victorian preaching difficult or alien to us Illustration LESLIE STEPHEN Humility as well as fear camaraderie as well as cynicism a sense of complexity and a kind of gay and worldly charity have led us to avoid the pose of the preacher to be moral by ironies to whisper a word and glide away But whatever may be the accidental advantage of this recoil from the didactic it certainly does mean some loss of courage and of the old and athletic simplicity Nay in some sense it is really a loss of a fine pride and self regard Mr Whistler coquetted and bargained about the position and sale of his pictures he praised them he set huge prices on them but still under all disguise he treated them as trifles Watts when scarcely more than a boy and comparatively unknown started his great custom of offering his pictures as gifts worthy of a great nation Thus we came to the conclusion a conclusion which may seem to some to contain a faint element of paradox that Mr Whistler suffered from an excessive and exaggerated modesty And this unnatural modesty of Mr Whistler can scarcely be more typically symbolized than in his horror of preaching The new school of art and thought does indeed wear an air of audacity and breaks out everywhere into blasphemies as if it required any courage to say a blasphemy There is only one thing that it requires real courage to say and that is a truism Lastly it would be quite impossible to complete this prefatory suggestion of the atmosphere in which the mind of Watts grew and prevailed without saying something about that weary and weather beaten question of the relation of art to ethics on which so much has been said in connexion with him and his contemporaries About the real aim and the real value of Watts allegorical pictures I shall speak later but for the moment it is only desirable to point out what the early and middle Victorian view of the matter really was According to the later sthetic creed which Mr Whistler and others did so much to preach the state of the arts under the reign of that Victorian view was a chaos of everyone minding everyone else s business It was a world in which painters were trying to be novelists and novelists trying to be historians and musicians doing the work of schoolmasters and sculptors doing the work of curates That is a view which has some truth in it both as a description of the actual state of things and as involving an interesting and suggestive philosophy of the arts But a good deal of harm may be done by ceaselessly repeating to ourselves even a true and fascinating fashionable theory and a great deal of good by endeavouring to realize the real truth about an older one The thing from which England suffers just now more than from any other evil is not the assertion of falsehoods but the endless and irrepressible repetition of half truths There is another side to every historic situation and that often a startling one and the other side of the Victorian view of art now so out of mode is too little considered The salient and essential characteristic of Watts and men of his school was that they regarded life as a whole They had in their heads as it were a synthetic philosophy which put everything into a certain relation with God and the wheel of things Thus psychologically speaking they were incapable not merely of holding such an opinion but actually of thinking such a thought as that of art for art s sake it was to them like talking about voting for voting s sake or amputating for amputating s sake To them as to the ancient Jews the Spirit of the unity of existence declared in thunder that they should not make any graven image or have any gods but Him Doubtless they did not give art a Illustration WALTER CRANE relation of unimpeachable correctness in their scheme of things it may be true or rather it is true that the sthetic was confused with the utilitarian that good gardens were turned so to speak into bad cornfields and a valuable temple into a useless post office But in so far as they had this fundamental idea that art must be linked to life and to the strength and honour of nations they were a hundred times more broad minded and more right than the new ultra technical school The idea of following art through everything for itself alone through extravagance through cruelty through morbidity is just exactly as superstitious as the idea of following theology for itself alone through extravagance and cruelty and morbidity To deny that Baudelaire is loathsome or Nietzsche inhuman because we stand in awe of beauty is just the same thing as denying that the Court of Pope Julius was loathsome or the rack inhuman because we stand in awe of religion It is not necessary and it is not honest The young critics of the Green Carnation with their nuances and technical mysteries would doubtless be surprised to learn that as a class they resemble ecstatic nuns but their principle is in reality the same There is a great deal to be said for them and a great deal for that matter to be said for nuns But there is nothing to be surprised at nothing to call for any charge of inconsistency or lack of enlightenment about the conduct of Watts and the great men of his age in being unable to separate art from ethics They were nationalists and universalists they thought that the ecstatic isolation of the religious sense had done incalculable harm to religion It is not remarkable or unreasonable that they should think that the ecstatic isolation of the artistic sense would do incalculable harm to art This then was the atmosphere of Watts and Victorian idealism an atmosphere so completely vanished from the world of art in which we now live that the above somewhat long introduction is really needed to make it vivid or human to us These three elements may legitimately as I have said be predicated of it as its main characteristics first the sceptical idealism the belief that abstract verities remained the chief affairs of men when theology left them second the didactic simplicity the claim to teach other men and to assume one s own value and rectitude third the cosmic utilitarianism the consideration of any such thing as art or philosophy perpetually with reference to a general good They may be right or wrong they may be returning or gone for ever theories and fashions may change the face of humanity again and yet again but at least in that one old man at Limnerslease burned and burned until death these convictions like three lamps in an old pagan temple of stoicism Of the ancestry of Watts so little is known that it resolves itself into one hypothesis a hypothesis which brings with it a suggestion a suggestion employed by almost all his existing biographers but a suggestion which cannot I think pass unchallenged although the matter may appear somewhat theoretic and remote Watts was born in London but his family had in the previous generation come from Hereford The vast amount of Welsh blood which is by the nature of the case to be found in Herefordshire has led to the statement that Watts is racially a Celt which is very probably true But it is also said in almost every notice of his life and work that the Celtic spirit can be detected in his painting that the Celtic principle of mysticism is a characteristic of his artistic conceptions It is in no idly antagonistic spirit that I venture to doubt this most profoundly Illustration THE SLUMBER OF THE AGES Watts may or may not be racially a Celt but there is nothing Celtic about his mysticism The essential Celtic spirit in letters and art may I think be defined as a sense of the unbearable beauty of things The essential spirit of Watts may I think be much better expressed as a sense of the joyful austerity of things The dominant passion of the artistic Celt of Mr W B Yeats or Sir Edward Burne Jones is in the word escape escape into a land where oranges grow on plum trees and men can sow what they like and reap what they enjoy To Watts the very word escape would be horrible like an obscene word his ideal is altogether duty and the great wheel To the Celt frivolity is most truly the most serious of things since in the tangle of roses is always the old serpent who is wiser than the world To Watts seriousness is most truly the most joyful of things since in it we come nearest to that ultimate equilibrium and reconciliation of things whereby alone they live and endure life and each other It is difficult to imagine that amid all the varieties of noble temper and elemental desire there could possibly be two exhibiting a more total divergence than that between a kindly severity and an almost cruel love of sweetness than that between a laborious and open air charity and a kind of Bacchic asceticism between a joy in peace and a joy in disorder between a reduction of existence to its simplest formula and an extension of it to its most frantic corollary between a lover of justice who accepts the real world more submissively than a slave and a lover of pleasure who despises the real world more bitterly than a hermit between a king in battle harness and a vagabond in elf land between Watts and Sir Edward Burne Jones It is remarkable that even the technical style of Watts gives a contradiction to this Celtic theory Watts is strong precisely where the Celt is weak and weak precisely where the Celt is strong The only thing that the Celt has lacked in art is that hard mass that naked outline that which makes Watts a sort of sculptor of draughtsmanship It is as well for us that the Celt has not had this if he had he would rule the world with a rod of iron for he has everything else There are no hard black lines in Burke s orations or Tom Moore s songs or the plays of Mr W B Yeats Burke is the greatest of political philosophers because in him only are there distances and perspectives as there are on the real earth with its mists of morning and evening and its blue horizons and broken skies Moore s songs have neither a pure style nor deep realization nor originality of form nor thought nor wit nor vigour but they have something else which is none of these things which is nameless and the one thing needful In Mr Yeats plays there is only one character the hero who rules and kills all the others and his name is Atmosphere Atmosphere and the gleaming distances are the soul of Celtic greatness as they were of Burne Jones who was as I have said weak precisely where Watts is strong in the statuesque quality in drawing in the love of heavy hands like those of Mammon of a strong back like that of Eve Repentant in a single fearless and austere outline like that of the angel in The Court of Death in the frame filling violence of Jonah in the half witted brutality of The Minotaur He is deficient that is to say in what can only be called the god like materialism of art Watts on the other hand is peculiarly strong in it Idealist as he is there is nothing frail or phantasmal about the things or the figures he loves Though not himself a robust man he loves robustness he loves a great bulk of shoulder an abrupt bend of neck a gigantic stride Illustration CARDINAL MANNING a large and swinging limb a breast bound as with bands of brass Of course the deficiency in such a case is very far from being altogether on one side There are abysses in Burne Jones which Watts could not understand the Celtic madness older than any sanity the hunger that will remain after the longest feast the sorrow that is built up of stratified delights From the point of view of the true Celt Watts the Watts who painted the great stoical pictures Love and Death Time Death and Judgment The Court of Death Mammon and Cain this pictorial Watts would probably be must almost certainly be simply a sad sane strong stupid Englishman He may or may not be Welsh by extraction or by part of his extraction but in spirit he is an Englishman with all the faults and all the disadvantages of an Englishman He is a great Englishman like Milton or Gladstone of the type that is to say that were too much alive for anything but gravity and who enjoyed themselves far too much to trouble to enjoy a joke Matthew Arnold has come near to defining that kind of idealism so utterly different from the Celtic kind which is to be found in Milton and again in Watts He has called it in one of his finest and most accurate phrases the imaginative reason This racial legend about the Watts family does not seem to rest upon any certain foundations and as I have said the deduction drawn from it is quite loose and misleading The whole is only another example of that unfortunate if not infamous modern habit of talking about such things as heredity with a vague notion that science has closed the question when she has only just opened it Nobody knows as a matter of fact whether a Celtic mysticism can be inherited any more than a theory on the Education Bill But the eagerness of the popular mind to snatch at a certainty is too impatient for the tardy processes of real hypothesis and research Long before heredity has become a science it has become a superstition And this curious though incidental case of the origin of the Watts genius is just one of those cases which make us wonder what has been the real result of the great rise of science So far the result would painfully appear to be that whereas men in the earlier times said unscientific things with the vagueness of gossip and legend they now say unscientific things with the plainness and the certainty of science The actual artistic education of Watts though thorough indeed in its way had a somewhat peculiar character the air of something detached and private and to the external eye something even at random He works hard but in an elusive and personal manner He does not remember the time when he did not draw he was an artist in his babyhood as he is an artist still in his old age Like Ruskin and many other of the great and serious men of the century he would seem to have been brought up chiefly on what may be called the large legendary literature on such as Homer and Scott Among his earliest recorded works was a set of coloured illustrations to the Waverley Novels and a sketch of the struggle for the body of Patroclus He went to the Academy schools but only stayed there about a month never caring for or absorbing the teaching such as it was of the place He wandered perpetually in the Greek galleries of the British Museum staring at the Elgin marbles from which he always declared he learnt all the art he knew There he said stretching out his hand towards the Ilyssus in his studio there is my master We hear of a friendship between him and the sculptor William Behnes of Watts lounging about that artist s studio playing with clay modelling busts and staring Illustration CHAOS at the work of sculpture His eyes seemed to have been at this time the largest and hungriest part of him Even when the great chance and first triumph of his life arrived a year or two later even when he gained the great scholarship which sent him abroad to work amid the marbles of Italy when a famous ambassador was his patron and a brilliant circle his encouragement we do not find anything of the conventional student about him He never painted in the galleries he only dreamed in them This must not of course be held to mean that he did not work though one or two people who have written memoirs of Watts have used a phraseology probably without noticing it which might be held to imply this Not only is the thing ludicrously incongruous with his exact character and morals but anyone who knows anything whatever about the nature of pictorial art will know quite well that a man could not paint like that without having worked just as he would know that a man could not be the Living Serpent without any previous practice with his joints To say that he could really learn to paint and draw with the technical merit of Watts or with any technical merit at all by simply looking at other people s pictures and statues will seem to anyone with a small technical sense like saying that a man learnt to be a sublime violinist by staring at fiddles in a shop window It is as near a physical impossibility as can exist in these matters Work Watts must have done and did do it is the only conclusion possible which is consistent either with the nature of Watts or the nature of painting and it is fully supported by the facts But what the facts do reveal is that he worked in this curiously individual this curiously invisible way He had his own notion of when to dream and when to draw as he shrank from no toil so he shrank from no idleness He was something which is one of the most powerful and successful things in the world something which is far more powerful and successful than a legion of students and prizemen he was a serious and industrious truant It is worth while to note this in his boyhood partly of course because from one end of his life to the other there is this queer note of loneliness and liberty But it is also more immediately and practically important because it throws some light on the development and character of his art and even especially of his technique The great singularity of Watts considered as a mere artist is that he stands alone He is not connected with any of the groups of the nineteenth century he has neither followed a school nor founded one He is not medi val but no one could exactly call him classical we have only to compare him to Leighton to feel the difference at once His artistic style is rather a thing more primitive than paganism a thing to which paganism and medi valism are alike upstart sects a style of painting there might have been upon the tower of Babel He is mystical but he is not medi val we have only to compare him to Rossetti to feel the difference When he emerged into the artistic world that world was occupied by the pompous and historical school that school which was so exquisitely caricatured by Thackeray in Gandish and his Boadishia but Watts was not pompous or historical he painted one historical picture which brought him a youthful success and he has scarcely painted another He lived on through the great Pre Raphaelite time that very noble and very much undervalued time when men found again what had been hidden since the thirteenth century under loads of idle civilization the truth that simplicity and a monastic laboriousness is the happiest of all things the great truth that purity is the only atmosphere for passion the great truth that silver is more beautiful than gold But though there is any quantity of this sentiment in Watts himself Watts never has been a Pre Raphaelite He has seen other fashions come and go he has seen the Pre Raphaelites overwhelmed by a heavy restoration of the conventional headed by Millais with his Scotch moors and his English countesses but he has not heeded it He has seen these again overturned by the wild lancers of Whistler he has seen the mists of Impressionism settle down over the world making it weird and delicate and noncommittal but he thinks no more of the wet mist of the Impressionist than he thought of the dry glare of the Pre Raphaelite He the most mild of men has yet never been anything but Watts He has followed the gleam like some odd modern Merlin He has escaped all the great atmospheres the divine if deluding intoxications which have whirled one man one way and one another which flew to the head of a perfect stylist like Ruskin and made him an insane scientist which flew to the head of a great artist like Whistler and made him a pessimistic dandy He has passed them with a curious immunity an immunity which if it were not so nakedly innocent might almost be called egotism but which is in fact rather the single eye He said once that he had not even consented to illustrate a book his limitation was that he could express no ideas but his own He admired Tennyson he thought him the greatest of poets he thought him a far greater man than himself he read him he adored him but he could not illustrate him This is the curious secret strength which kept him independent in his youth and kept him independent through the great roaring triumph of the Pre Raphaelite and the great roaring triumph of the Impressionist He stands in the world of art as he stood in the studio of Behnes and in the Uffizi Gallery He stands gazing but not copying Of Watts as he was at this time there remains a very interesting portrait painted by himself It represents him at the age of nineteen a dark slim and very boyish looking creature Something in changed conditions may no doubt account for the flowing and voluminous dark hair we see such a mane in many of the portraits of the most distinguished men of that time but if a man appeared now and walked down Fleet Street with so neglected a hure he would be mistaken for an advertisement of a hair dresser or by the more malicious for a minor poet But there is about this picture not a trace of affectation or the artistic immunity in these matters the boy s dress is rough and ordinary his expression is simple and unconscious From a modern standpoint we should say without hesitation that if his hair is long it is because he has forgotten to have it cut And there is something about this contrast between the unconsciously leonine hair and the innocent and almost bashful face there is something like a parable of Watts His air is artistic if you will His famous skull cap which makes him look like a Venetian senator is as pictorial and effective as the boyish mane in the picture But he belongs to that older race of Bohemians of which even Thackeray only saw the sunset the great old race of art and literature who were ragged because they were really poor frank because they were really free and untidy because they were really forgetful It will not do to confuse Watts with these men there is Illustration FOR HE HAD GREAT POSSESSIONS much about him that is precise and courtly and which as I shall have occasion to remark belongs really to a yet older period But it is more right to reckon Watts along with them in their genuine raggedness than to suppose that the unquestionable picturesqueness with which he fronts the world has any relation with that new Bohemianism which is untidy because it is conventional frank because it follows a fashion careless because it watches for all its effects and ragged and coarse in its tastes because it has too much money The first definite encouragement or at least the first encouragement now ascertainable probably came to the painter from that interesting Greek amateur Mr Constantine Ionides It was under his encouragement that Watts began all his earlier work of the more ambitious kind and it was the portrait of Mrs Constantine Ionides which ranks among the earliest of his definite successes He achieved immediate professional success however at an astonishingly early age judged by modern standards When he was barely twenty he had three pictures in the Royal Academy the first two were portraits and the third a picture called The Wounded Heron There is always a very considerable temptation to fantasticality in dealing with these artistic origins no doubt it does not always follow that a man is destined to be a military conqueror because he beats other little boys at school nor endued with a passionate and clamorous nature because he begins this mortal life with a yell But Watts has to a rather unusual degree a sincere and consistent and homogeneous nature and this first exhibit of his has really a certain amount of symbolism about it Portraiture with which he thus began he was destined to raise to a level never before attained in English art so far as significance and humanity are concerned and there is really something a little fascinating about the fact that along with these pictures went one picture which had for all practical purposes an avowedly humanitarian object The picture of The Wounded Heron scarcely ever attracts attention I imagine in these days but it may of course have been recalled for a moment to the popular mind by that curious incident which occurred in connexion with it and which has often been told Long after the painter who produced that picture in his struggling boyhood had lost sight of it and in all probability forgotten all about its existence a chance traveller with a taste in the arts happened to find it in the dusty curiosity shop of a north country town He bought it and gave it back to the now celebrated painter who hung it among the exhibits at Little Holland House It is as I have said a thing painted clearly with a humanitarian object it depicts the suffering of a stricken creature it depicts the helplessness of life under the cruelty of the inanimate violence it depicts the pathos of dying and the greater pathos of living Since then no doubt Watts has improved his machinery of presentation and found larger and more awful things to tell his tale with than a bleeding bird The wings of the heron have widened till they embrace the world with the terrible wings of Time or Death he has summoned the stars to help him and sent the angels as his ambassadors He has changed the plan of operations until it includes Heaven and Tartarus He has never changed the theme The relations of Watts to Constantine Ionides either arose or became important about this time The painter s fortunes rose quickly and steadily so far as the Academy was concerned He continued to exhibit with a fair amount of regularity chiefly in the form of subjects from the great romantic or Illustration AN IDLE CHILD OF FANCY historic traditions which were then the whole pabulum of the young idealistic artist In the Academy of came a picture on the old romantic subject of Ferdinand and Isabella in the following year but one a picture on the old romantic subject of Cymbeline The portrait of Mrs Constantine Ionides appeared in But Watts mode of thought from the very beginning had very little kinship with the Academy and very little kinship with this kind of private and conventional art An event was shortly to occur the first success of his life but an event far less important when considered as the first success of his life than it is when considered as an essential characteristic of his mind The circumstances are so extremely characteristic of something in the whole spirit of the man s art that it may be permissible to dwell at length on the significance of the fact rather than on the fact itself The great English Parliament the Senate that broke the English kings had just moved its centre of existence The new Houses of Parliament had opened with what seemed to the men of that time an opening world A competition was started for the decoration of the halls and Watts suddenly sprang into importance he won the great prize The cartoon of Caractacus led in triumph through the streets of Rome was accepted from this almost nameless man by the great central power of English history And until we have understood that fact we have not understood Watts it was one may be permitted to fancy the supreme hour of his life For Watts nature is essentially public that is to say it is modest and noble and has nothing to hide His art is an outdoor art like that of the healthy ages of the world like the statuesque art of Greece like the ecclesiastical and external Gothic art of Christianity an art that can look the sun in the face He ought to be employed to paint factory chimneys and railway stations I know that this will sound like an insolence my only answer is that he in accordance with this great conception of his actually offered to paint a railway station With a splendid and truly religious imagination he asked permission to decorate Euston The railway managers not perceiving in their dull classical routine the wild poetry of their own station declined But until we have understood this immense notion of publicity in the soul of Watts we have understood nothing The fundamental modern fallacy is that the public life must be an artificial life It is like saying that the public street must be an artificial air Men like Watts men like all the great heroes only breathe in public What is the use of abusing a man for publicity when he utters in public the true and the enduring things What is the use above all of prying into his secrecy when he has cried his best from the house tops This is the real argument which makes a detailed biography of Watts unnecessary for all practical purposes It is in vain to climb walls and hide in cupboards in order to show whether Watts eats mustard or pepper with his curry or whether Watts takes sugar or salt with his porridge These things may or may not become public it matters little The innermost that the biographer could at last discover after all possible creepings and capers would be what Watts in his inmost soul believes and that Watts has splashed on twenty feet of canvas and given to the nation for nothing Like one of the great orators of the eighteenth century his public virtues his public ecstasies are far more really significant than his private weaknesses The rest of his life is so simple that it is scarcely worth telling He went with the great scholarship he gained with his Caractacus to Italy There he found a new patron the famous Lord Holland with the whole of whose great literary circle he rapidly became acquainted He painted many of his most famous portraits in connexion with this circle both in Italy and afterwards in Paris But this great vision of the public idea had entered his blood He offered his cartoons to Euston Station he painted St George and the Dragon for the House of Lords he presented a fresco to the great hall at Lincoln s Inn Of his life there is scarcely more to say except the splendid fact that he three times refused a title Of his character there is a great deal more to say There is unquestionably about the personal attitude of Watts something that in the vague phraseology of modern times would be called Puritan Puritan however is very far from being really the right word The right word is a word which has been singularly little used in English nomenclature because historical circumstances have separated us from the origin from which it sprang The right word for the spirit of Watts is Stoicism Watts is at one with the Puritans in the actual objects of his attack One of his deepest and most enduring troubles a matter of which he speaks and writes frequently is the prevalence of gambling With the realism of an enthusiast he has detected the essential fact that the problem of gambling is even more of a problem in the case of the poorer classes than in the case of the richer It is as he asserts a far worse danger than drink There are many other instances of his political identity with Puritanism He told Mr W T Stead that he had defended and was prepared to defend the staggering publications of the Maiden Tribute it was the only way he said to stem the evil A picturesque irradiation asserts indeed that it was under the glow of Hebraic anger against these Babylonian cruelties of Piccadilly and the Strand that he painted as a symbol of those cruelties that brutal and magnificent picture The Minotaur The pictures themselves of course bear sufficient attestation to this general character Mammon is what we call a Puritan picture and Jonah and Fata Morgana and For he had Great Possessions It is not difficult to see that Watts has the Puritan vigilance the Puritan realism and the Puritan severity in his attitude towards public affairs Nevertheless as I have said he is to be described rather as a Stoic than a Puritan The essential difference between Christian and Pagan asceticism lies in the fact that Paganism in renouncing pleasure gives up something which it does not think desirable whereas Christianity in giving up pleasure gives up something which it thinks very desirable indeed Thus there is a frenzy in Christian asceticism its follies and renunciations are like those of first love There is a passion and as it were a regret in the Puritanism of Bunyan there is none in the Puritanism of Watts He is not Bunyan he is Cato The difference may be a difficult one to convey but it is one that must not be ignored or great misunderstandings will follow The one self abnegation is more reasonable but less joyful The Stoic casts away pleasure like the parings of his nails the Mystic cuts it off like his right hand that offends him In Watts we have the noble self abnegation of a noble type and school but everything however noble that has shape has limitation and we must not look in Watts with his national self mastery either for the nightmare of Stylites or the gaiety of Francis of Assisi It has already been remarked that the chief note Illustration THE MINOTAUR of the painter s character is a certain mixture of personal delicacy and self effacement with the most immense and audacious aims But it is so essential a trait that it will bear a repetition and the introduction of a curious example of it Watts in his quaint and even shy manner of speech often let fall in conversation words which hint at a certain principle or practice of his a principle and practice which are when properly apprehended beyond expression impressive and daring The spectator who studies his allegorical paintings one after another will be vaguely impressed with something uniquely absent something which is usual and familiar in such pictures conspicuous by its withdrawal a blank or difference which makes them things sundered altogether from the millions of allegorical pictures that throng the great and small galleries of painting At length the nature of this missing thing may suddenly strike him in the whole range of Watts symbolic art there is scarcely a single example of the ordinary and arbitrary current symbol the ecclesiastical symbol the heraldic symbol the national symbol A primeval vagueness and archaism hang over all the canvases and cartoons like frescoes from some prehistoric temple There is nothing there but the eternal things clay and fire and the sea and motherhood and the dead We cannot imagine the rose or the lion of England the keys or the tiara of Rome the red cap of Liberty or the crescent of Islam in a picture by Watts we cannot imagine the Cross itself And in light and broken phrases carelessly and humbly expressed as I have said the painter has admitted that this great omission was observed on principle Its object is that the pictures may be intelligible if they survive the whole modern order Its object is that is to say that if some savage in a dim futurity dug up one of these dark designs on a lonely mountain though he worshipped strange gods and served laws yet unwritten it might strike the same message to his soul that it strikes upon clerks and navvies from the walls of the Tate Gallery It is impossible not to feel a movement of admiration for the magnitude of the thought Here is a man whose self depreciation is internal and vital whose life is cloistered whose character is childlike and he has yet within such an unconscious and colossal sense of greatness that he paints on the assumption that his work may outlast the cross of the Eternal City As a boy he scarcely expected worldly success as an old man he still said that his worldly success had astonished him But in his nameless youth and in his silent old age he paints like one upon a tower looking down the appalling perspective of the centuries towards fantastic temples and inconceivable republics This union of small self esteem with a vast ambition is a paradox in the very soul of the painter and when we look at the symbolic pictures in the light of this theory of his it is interesting and typical to observe how consistently he pursues any intellectual rule that he laid down for himself An sthetic or ethical notion of this kind is not to him as to most men with the artistic temperament a thing to talk about sumptuously to develop in lectures and to observe when it happens to be suitable It is a thing like his early rising or his personal conscience a thing which is either a rule or nothing And we find this insistence on universal symbols this rejection of all symbols that are local or temporary or topical even if the locality be a whole continent the time a stretch of centuries or the topic a vast civilization or an undying church we find this insistence looking out very clearly from the allegories of Watts It would Illustration THE COURT OF DEATH have been easy and effective as he himself often said to make the meaning of a picture clear by the introduction of some popular and immediate image and it must constantly be remembered that Watts does care very much for making the meaning of his pictures clear His work indeed has as I shall suggest shortly a far more subtle and unnamable quality than the merely hard and didactic but it must not be for one moment pretended that Watts does not claim to teach to do so would be to falsify the man s life And it would be easy as is quite obvious to make the pictures clearer to hang a crucifix over the Happy Warrior to give Mammon some imperial crown or typical heraldic symbols to give a theological machinery to The Court of Death But this is put on one side like a temptation of the flesh because it conflicts with this stupendous idea of painting for all peoples and all centuries I am not saying that this extraordinary ambition is necessarily the right view of art or the right view of life I am only reiterating it as an absolute trait of men of the time and type and temper of Watts It may plausibly be maintained I am not sure that it cannot more truly be maintained that man cannot achieve and need not achieve this frantic universality A man I fancy is after all only an animal that has noble preferences It is the very difference between the artistic mind and the mathematical that the former sees things as they are in a picture some nearer and larger some smaller and further away while to the mathematical mind everything every unit in a million every fact in a cosmos must be of equal value That is why mathematicians go mad and poets scarcely ever do A man may have as wide a view of life as he likes the wider the better a distant view a bird s eye view if he will but still a view and not a map The one thing he cannot attempt in his version of the universe is to draw things to scale I have put myself for a moment outside this universalism and doubted its validity because a thing always appears more sharp and personal and picturesque if we do not wholly agree with it And this universalism is an essential and dominant feature of such great men as Watts and of his time as a whole Mr Herbert Spencer is a respectable almost a dapper figure his theory is agnostic and his tone polite and precise And yet he threw himself into a task more insane and gigantic than that of Dante an inventory or plan of the universe itself the awful vision of existence as a single organism like an am ba on the disc of a microscope He claimed by implication to put in their right places the flaming certainty of the martyrs the wild novelties of the modern world to arrange the eternal rock of Peter and the unbroken trance of Buddhism It is only in this age of specialists of cryptic experiences in art and faith like the present that we can see how huge was that enterprise but the spirit of it is the spirit of Watts The man of that aggressive nineteenth century had many wild thoughts but there was one thought that never even for an instant strayed across his burning brain He never once thought Why should I understand the cat any more than the cat understands me He never thought Why should I be just to the merits of a Chinaman any more than a pig studies the mystic virtues of a camel He affronted heaven and the angels but there was one hard arrogant dogma that he never doubted even when he doubted Godhead he never doubted that he himself was as central and as responsible as God This paradox then we call the first element in the artistic and personal claim of Watts that he Illustration MATTHEW ARNOLD Illustration JOHN STUART MILL realizes the great paradox of the Gospel He is meek but he claims to inherit the earth But there is of course a great deal more to be said before this view of the matter can be considered complete The universalism preached by Watts and the other great Victorians was of course subject to certain specialisations it is not necessary to call them limitations Like Matthew Arnold the last and most sceptical of them who expressed their basic idea in its most detached and philosophic form they held that conduct was three fourths of life They were ingrainedly ethical the mere idea of thinking anything more important than ethics would have struck them as profane In this they were certainly right but they were nevertheless partial or partisan they did not really maintain the judicial attitude of the universalist The mere thought of Watts painting a picture called The Victory of Joy over Morality or Nature rebuking Conscience is enough to show the definite limits of that cosmic equality This is not of course to be taken as a fault in the attitude of Watts He simply draws the line somewhere as all men including anarchists draw it somewhere he is dogmatic as all sane men are dogmatic There is another phase of this innocent audacity It may appear to be more fanciful it is certainly more completely a matter of inference but it throws light on yet another side of the character of Watts Watts relation to friends and friendship has something about it very typical He is not a man desirous or capable of a very large or rich or varied circle of acquaintance There is nothing Bohemian about him He belongs both chronologically and psychologically to that period which is earlier even than Thackeray and his Cave of Harmony he belongs to the quiet struggling self created men of the forties with their tradition of self abnegating individualism Much as there is about him of the artist and the poet there is something about him also of the industrious apprentice That strenuous solitude in which Archbishop Temple as a boy struggled to carry a bag of ironmongery which crushed his back in which Gladstone cut down trees and John Stuart Mill read half the books of the world in boyhood that strenuous solitude entered to some degree into the very soul of Watts and made him independent of them But the friends he made have as a general rule been very characteristic they have marked the strange and haughty fastidiousness that goes along with his simplicity His friends his intimate friends that is have been marked by a certain indescribable and stately worthiness more than one of them have been great men like himself The greatest and most intimate of all his friends probably was Tennyson and in this there is something singularly characteristic of Watts About the actuality of the intellectual tie that bound him to Tennyson there can be little doubt He painted three if not four portraits of him his name was often on his lips he invoked him always as the typical great poet excusing his faults and expounding his virtues He invoked his authority as that of the purest of poets and invoked it very finely and well in a sharp controversial interview he had on the nature and ethics of the nude in art At the time I write there is standing at the end of the garden at Limnerslease a vast shed used for a kind of sculptor s studio in which there stands a splendid but unfinished statue on which the veteran of the arts is even now at work It represents Tennyson wrapped in his famous mantle with his magnificent head bowed gazing at something in the Illustration ROBERT BROWNING Illustration LORD TENNYSON hollow of his hand The subject is Flower in the Crannied Wall There is something very characteristic of Watts in the contrast between the colossal plan of the figure and the smallness of the central object But while the practical nature of the friendship between Watts and Tennyson is clear enough there is something really significant something really relevant to Watts attitude in its ultimate and psychological character It is surely most likely that Watts and Tennyson were drawn together because they both represented a certain relation towards their art which is not common in our time and was scarcely properly an attribute of any artists except these two Watts could not have found the thing he most believed in Browning or Swinburne or Morris or any of the other poets Tennyson could not have found the thing he most believed in Leighton or Millais or any of the other painters They were brought together it must be supposed by the one thing that they had really in common a profound belief in the solemnity the ceremoniousness the responsibility and what most men would now in all probability call the pomposity of the great arts Watts has always a singular kind of semi mystical tact in the matter of portrait painting His portraits are commonly very faultless comments and have the same kind of superlative mental delicacy that we see in the picture of Hope And the whole truth of this last matter is very well expressed in Watts famous portrait of Tennyson particularly if we look at it in conjunction with his portrait of Browning The head of Browning is the head of a strong splendid joyful and anxious man who could write magnificent poetry The head of Tennyson is the head of a poet Watts has painted Tennyson with his dark dome like head relieved against a symbolic green and blue of the eternal sea and the eternal laurels He has behind him the bays of Dante and he is wrapped in the cloak of the prophets Browning is dressed like an ordinary modern man and we at once feel that it should and must be so To dress Browning in the prophet s robe and the poet s wreath would strike us all as suddenly ridiculous it would be like sending him to a fancy dress ball It would be like attiring Matthew Arnold in the slashed tights of an Elizabethan or putting Mr Lecky into a primitive Celto Irish kilt But it does not strike us as absurd in the case of Tennyson it does not strike us as even eccentric or outlandish or remote We think of Tennyson in that way we think of him as a lordly and conscious bard Some part of this fact may of course be due to his possession of a magnificent physical presence but not I think all Lord Kitchener let us say is a handsome man but we should laugh at him very much in silver armour It is much more due to the fact that Tennyson really assumed and was granted this stately and epic position It is not true that Tennyson was more of a poet than Browning if we mean by that statement that Browning could not compose forms as artistic and well managed lyrics as light and poignant and rhythms as swelling and stirring as any in English letters But it is true that Tennyson was more of a poet than Browning if we mean by that statement that Tennyson was a poet in person in post and circumstance and conception of life and that Browning was not in that sense a poet at all Browning first inaugurated in modern art and letters the notion or tradition in many ways perhaps a more wholesome one that the fact that a man pursued the trade or practice of poetry was his own affair and a thing apart Illustration THE DWELLER IN THE INNERMOST like the fact that he collected coins or earned his living as a hatter But Tennyson really belonged to an older tradition the tradition that believed that the poet the appointed Vates was a recognized and public figure like the bard or jester at the medi val courts like the prophet in the old Commonwealth of Israel In Tennyson s work appeared for the last time in English history this notion of the stately and public and acknowledged poet it was the lay of the last minstrel Now there is in Watts gentle and invisible as he is something that profoundly responds to that spirit Leighton like Browning was a courtier and man of the world Millais like Browning was a good fellow and an ordinary gentleman but Watts has more of Tennyson in him he believes in a great priesthood of art He believes in a certain pure and childish publicity If anyone suggested that before a man ventured to paint pictures or to daub with plaster he should be initiated with some awful rites in some vast and crowded national temple should swear to work worthily before some tremendous altar or over some symbolic flame Millais would have laughed heartily at the idea and Leighton also But it would not seem either absurd or unreasonable to Watts In the thick of this smoky century he is living in a clear age of heroes Watts relations to Tennyson were indeed very characteristic of what was finest and at the same time quaintest in the two men The painter with a typical sincerity took the poet seriously I had almost said literally in his daily life and liked him to live up to his poetry The poet with that queer sulky humour which gave him perhaps more breadth than Watts but less strength said after reading some acid and unjust criticisms I wish I had never written a line Come said Watts you wouldn t like King Arthur to talk like that Tennyson paused a moment and then spread out his fingers Well he said what do you expect It s all the gout The artist with a characteristic power of juvenile and immortal hero worship tells this story as an instance of the fundamental essence of odd magnanimity and sombre geniality in Tennyson It is such an instance and a very good one but it is also an instance of the sharp logical idealism of the prompt poetic candour of Watts He asked Tennyson to be King Arthur and it never occurred to him to think that he was asking Addison to be Cato or Massinger to be Saint Dorothy The incident is a fine tribute to a friendship The real difficulty which many cultivated people have in the matter of Watts allegorical pictures is far more difficult It is indeed nothing else but the great general reaction against allegorical art which has arisen during the last artistic period The only way in which we can study with any real sincerity the allegoric art of Watts is to ask to what is really due the objection to allegory which has thus arisen The real objection to allegory is it may roughly be said founded upon the conception that allegory involves one art imitating another This is up to a certain point true To paint a figure in a blue robe and call her Necessity and then paint a small figure in a yellow robe and call it Invention to put the second on the knee of the first and then say that you are enunciating the sublime and eternal truth that Necessity is the mother of Invention this is indeed an idle and foolish affair It is saying in six weeks work with brush and palette knife what could be said much better in six words And there can be no reasonable dispute that of this character were a considerable Illustration GEORGE MEREDITH number of the allegorical pictures that have crowded the galleries and sprawled over the ceilings of ancient and modern times Of such were the monstrous pictures of Rubens which depicted a fat Religion and a bloated Temperance dancing before some foreign conqueror of such were the florid designs of the eighteenth century which showed Venus and Apollo encouraging Lord Peterborough to get over the inconvenience of his breastplate of such again were the meek Victorian allegories which showed Mercy and Foresight urging men to found a Society for the Preservation of Young Game Of such were almost all the allegories which have dominated the art of Europe for many centuries back Of such most emphatically the allegories of Watts are not They are not mere pictorial forms combined as in a kind of cryptogram to express theoretic views or relations They are not proverbs or verbal relations rendered with a cumbrous exactitude in oil and Chinese white They are not in short the very thing that the opponents of Watts and his school say that they are They are not merely literary There is one definite current conception on which this idea that Watts allegorical art is merely literary is eventually based It is based upon the idea that lies at the root of rationalism at the root of useless logomachies at the root in no small degree of the whole modern evil It is based on the assumption of the perfection of language Every religion and every philosophy must of course be based on the assumption of the authority or the accuracy of something But it may well be questioned whether it is not saner and more satisfactory to ground our faith on the infallibility of the Pope or the infallibility of the Book of Mormon than on this astounding modern dogma of the infallibility of human speech Every time one man says to another Tell us plainly what you mean he is assuming the infallibility of language that is to say he is assuming that there is a perfect scheme of verbal expression for all the internal moods and meanings of men Whenever a man says to another Prove your case defend your faith he is assuming the infallibility of language that is to say he is assuming that a man has a word for every reality in earth or heaven or hell He knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering more numberless and more nameless than the colours of an autumn forest he knows that there are abroad in the world and doing strange and terrible service in it crimes that have never been condemned and virtues that have never been christened Yet he seriously believes that these things can every one of them in all their tones and semi tones in all their blends and unions be accurately represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can really produce out of his own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of memory and all the agonies of desire Whenever on the other hand a man rebels faintly or vaguely against this way of speaking whenever a man says that he cannot explain what he means and that he hates argument that his enemy is misrepresenting him but he cannot explain how that man is a true sage and has seen into the heart of the real nature of language Whenever a man refuses to be caught by some dilemma about reason and passion or about reason and faith or about fate and free will he has seen the truth Whenever a man declines to be cornered as an egotist or an altruist or any such modern monster he has seen the truth For the truth is that language is not a scientific thing at all but wholly an artistic thing a thing invented by hunters and killers and such artists long before science was Illustration ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE dreamed of The truth is simply that that the tongue is not a reliable instrument like a theodolite or a camera The tongue is most truly an unruly member as the wise saint has called it a thing poetic and dangerous like music or fire Now we can easily imagine an alternative state of things roughly similar to that produced in Watts allegories a system that is to say whereby the moods or facts of the human spirit were conveyed by something other than speech by shapes or colours or some such things As a matter of fact of course there are a great many other languages besides the verbal Descriptions of spiritual states and mental purposes are conveyed by a variety of things by hats by bells by guns by fires on a headland or by jerks of the head In fact there does exist an example which is singularly analogous to decorative and symbolic painting This is a scheme of sthetic signs or emblems simple indeed and consisting only of a few elemental colours which is actually employed to convey great lessons in human safety and great necessities of the commonwealth It need hardly be said that I allude to the railway signals They are as much a language and surely as solemn a language as the colour sequence of ecclesiastical vestments which sets us red for martyrdom and white for resurrection For the green and red of the night signals depict the two most fundamental things of all which lie at the back of all language Yes and no good and bad safe and unsafe life and death It is perfectly conceivable that a degree of flexibility or subtlety might be introduced into these colours so as to suggest other and more complex meanings We might under the influence of some large poetic station masters reach a state of things in which a certain rich tinge of purple in the crimson light would mean Travel for a few seconds at a slightly more lingering pace that a romantic old lady in a first class carriage may admire the scenery of the forest A tendency towards peacock blue in the green might mean An old gentleman with a black necktie has just drunk a glass of sherry at the station restaurant But however much we modified or varied this colour sequence or colour language there would remain one thing which it would be quite ridiculous and untrue to say about it It would be quite ridiculous and untrue to say that this colour sequence was simply a symbol representing language It would be another language it would convey its meaning to aliens who had another word for forest and another word for sherry and another word for old lady It would not be a symbol of language a symbol of a symbol it would be one symbol of the reality and language would be another That is precisely the true position touching allegorical art in general and above all the allegorical art of Watts So long as we conceive that it is fundamentally the symbolizing of literature in paint we shall certainly misunderstand it and the rare and peculiar merits both technical and philosophical which really characterize it If the ordinary spectator at the art galleries finds himself let us say opposite a picture of a dancing flower crowned figure in a rose coloured robe he feels a definite curiosity to know the title looks it up in the catalogue and finds that it is called let us say Hope He is immediately satisfied as he would have been if the title had run Portrait of Lady Warwick a View of Kilchurn Castle It represents a certain definite thing the word hope But what does the word hope represent It represents only a broken instantaneous glimpse of something that is immeasurably older and wilder Illustration HOPE than language that is immeasurably older and wilder than man a mystery to saints and a reality to wolves To suppose that such a thing is dealt with by the word hope any more than America is represented by a distant view of Cape Horn would indeed be ridiculous It is not merely true that the word itself is like any other word arbitrary that it might as well be pig or parasol but it is true that the philosophical meaning of the word in the conscious mind of man is merely a part of something immensely larger in the unconscious mind that the gusty light of language only falls for a moment on a fragment and that obviously a semi detached unfinished fragment of a certain definite pattern on the dark tapestries of reality It is vain and worse than vain to declaim against the allegoric for the very word hope is an allegory and the very word allegory is an allegory Now let us suppose that instead of coming before that hypothetical picture of Hope in conventional flowers and conventional pink robes the spectator came before another picture Suppose that he found himself in the presence of a dim canvas with a bowed and stricken and secretive figure cowering over a broken lyre in the twilight What would he think His first thought of course would be that the picture was called Despair his second when he discovered his error in the catalogue that it has been entered under the wrong number his third that the painter was mad But if we imagine that he overcame these preliminary feelings and that as he stared at that queer twilight picture a dim and powerful sense of meaning began to grow upon him what would he see He would see something for which there is neither speech nor language which has been too vast for any eye to see and too secret for any religion to utter even as an esoteric doctrine Standing before that picture he finds himself in the presence of a great truth He perceives that there is something in man which is always apparently on the eve of disappearing but never disappears an assurance which is always apparently saying farewell and yet illimitably lingers a string which is always stretched to snapping and yet never snaps He perceives that the queerest and most delicate thing in us the most fragile the most fantastic is in truth the backbone and indestructible He knows a great moral fact that there never was an age of assurance that there never was an age of faith Faith is always at a disadvantage it is a perpetually defeated thing which survives all its conquerors The desperate modern talk about dark days and reeling altars and the end of Gods and angels is the oldest talk in the world lamentations over the growth of agnosticism can be found in the monkish sermons of the dark ages horror at youthful impiety can be found in the Iliad This is the thing that never deserts men and yet always with daring diplomacy threatens to desert them It has indeed dwelt among and controlled all the kings and crowds but only with the air of a pilgrim passing by It has indeed warmed and lit men from the beginning of Eden with an unending glow but it was the glow of an eternal sunset Here in this dim picture its trick is almost betrayed No one can name this picture properly but Watts who painted it has named it Hope But the point is that this title is not as those think who call it literary the reality behind the symbol but another symbol for the same thing or to speak yet more strictly another symbol describing another part or aspect of the same complex reality Two men felt a swift violent invisible thing in the world one said the word hope the other painted a Illustration JONAH picture in blue and green paint The picture is inadequate the word hope is inadequate but between them like two angles in the calculation of a distance they almost locate a mystery a mystery that for hundreds of ages has been hunted by men and evaded them And the title is therefore not so much the substance of one of Watts pictures it is rather an epigram upon it It is merely an approximate attempt to convey by snatching up the tool of another craftsman the direction attempted in the painter s own craft He calls it Hope and that is perhaps the best title It reminds us among other things of a fact which is too little remembered that faith hope and charity the three mystical virtues of Christianity are also the gayest of the virtues Paganism as I have suggested is not gay but rather nobly sad the spirit of Watts which is as a rule nobly sad also here comes nearer perhaps than anywhere else to mysticism in the strict sense the mysticism which is full of secret passion and belief like that of Fra Angelico or Blake But though Watts calls his tremendous reality Hope we may call it many other things Call it faith call it vitality call it the will to live call it the religion of to morrow morning call it the immortality of man call it self love and vanity it is the thing that explains why man survives all things and why there is no such thing as a pessimist It cannot be found in any dictionary or rewarded in any commonwealth there is only one way in which it can even be noticed and recognized If there be anywhere a man who has really lost it his face out of a whole crowd of men will strike us like a blow He may hang himself or become Prime Minister it matters nothing The man is dead Now of course the ordinary objection to allegory and it is a very sound objection can be sufficiently well stated by saying that the pictorial figures are mere arbitrary symbols of the words An allegorist of the pompous school might paint some group of Peace and Commerce doing something to Britannia There might be a figure of Commerce in a Greek robe with a cornucopia or bag of gold or an argosy or any other conventional symbol But it is surely quite evident that such a figure is a mere sign like the word commerce the word might just as well be dandelion and the Greek lady with the cornucopia might just as well be a Hebrew prophet standing on his head It is scarcely even a language it is a cipher code Nobody can maintain that the figure taken as a figure makes one think of commerce of the forces that effect commerce of a thousand ports of a thousand streets of a thousand warehouses and bills of lading of a thousand excited men in black coats who certainly would not know what to do with a cornucopia If we find ourselves gazing at some monument of the fragile and eternal faith of man at some ruined chapel at some nameless altar at some scrap of old Jacobin eloquence we might actually find our own minds moving in certain curves that centre in the curved back of Watts Hope we might almost think for ourselves of a bowed figure in the twilight holding to her breast something damaged but undestroyed But can anyone say that by merely looking at the Stock Exchange on a busy day we should think of a Greek lady with an argosy Can anyone say that Threadneedle Street in itself would inspire our minds to move in the curves which centre in a cornucopia Can anyone say that a very stolid figure in a very outlandish drapery is anything but a purely arbitrary sign like x or y for such a thing as modern commerce for the savagery of the rich for the hunger of the satisfied for the vast tachycardia or galloping of the heart that has fallen on all the great new centres of civilization for the sudden madness of all the mills of the world Watts Hope does tell us something more about the nature of hope than we can be told by merely noticing that hope is shown in individual cases that a man rehearses successful love speeches when he is in love and takes a return ticket when he goes out to fight a duel But the figure of Commerce with the cornucopia gives us less insight into what is behind commerce than we might get from reading a circular or staring out into the street In the case of Commerce the figure is merely a symbol of commerce which is a symbol In the case of Hope the matter is quite the other way the figure brings us nearer to something which is not a symbol but the reality behind symbols In the one case we go further down towards the river s delta in the other further up towards its fountain that at least may be called a difference And now suppose that our imaginary sight seer who had seen so much of the pompous allegory of Commerce in her Grecian draperies were to see for the second time a second picture Suppose he saw before him a throned figure clad in splendid heavy scarlet and gold above the lustre and dignity of which rose in abrupt contrast a face like the face of a blind beast Suppose that as this imperial thing with closed eyes and fat sightless face sat upon his magnificent seat he let his heavy hand and feet fall as if by a mere pulverizing accident on the naked and god like figures of the young on men and women Suppose that in the background there rose straight into the air a raw and turgid smoke as if from some invisible and horrible sacrifice and that by one final fantastic and triumphal touch this all destroying god and king were adorned with the ears of an ass declaring that he was royal imperial irresistible and when all is said imbecile Suppose that a man sick of argosies and cornucopias came before that picture would he not say perhaps even before he looked in the catalogue and found that the painter had called it Mammon would he not say This is something which in spirit and in essence I have seen before something which in spirit and in essence I have seen everywhere That bloated unconscious face so heavy so violent so wicked so innocent have I not seen it at street corners in billiard rooms in saloon bars laying down the law about Chartered shares or gaping at jokes about women Those huge and smashing limbs so weighty so silly so powerless and yet so powerful have I not seen them in the pompous movements the morbid health of the prosperous in the great cities The hard straight pillars of that throne have I not seen them in the hard straight hideous tiers of modern warehouses and factories That tawny and sulky smoke have I not seen it going up to heaven from all the cities of the coming world This is no trifling with argosies and Greek drapery This is commerce This is the home of the god himself This is why men hate him and why men fear him and why men endure him Now of course it is at once obvious that this view would be very unjust to commerce but that modification as a matter of fact very strongly supports the general theory at the moment under consideration Commerce is really an arbitrary phrase a thing including a million motives from the motive which makes a man drink to the motive which makes him reform from the motive that makes a starving man eat a horse to the motive which makes an idle man chase a butterfly But whatever other spirits there are in commerce there is beyond all reasonable Illustration MAMMON question in it this powerful and enduring spirit which Watts has painted There is as a ruling element in modern life in all life this blind and asinine appetite for mere power There is a spirit abroad among the nations of the earth which drives men incessantly on to destroy what they cannot understand and to capture what they cannot enjoy This and not commerce is what Watts has painted He has painted not the allegory of a great institution but the vision of a great appetite the vision of a great motive It is not true that this is a picture of Commerce but that Commerce and Watts picture spring from the same source There does exist a certain dark and driving force in the world one of its products is this picture another is Commerce The picture is not Commerce it is Mammon And indeed so powerfully and perfectly has Watts in this case realized the awful being whom he was endeavouring to call up by his artistic incantation that we may even say the common positions of allegory and reality are reversed The fact is not that here we have an effective presentation under a certain symbol of red robes and smoke and a throne of what the financial world is but rather that here we have something of the truth that is hidden behind the symbol of white waistcoats and hats on the back of the head of financial papers and sporting prophets of butter closing quiet and Pendragon being meant to win This is not a symbol of commerce commerce is a symbol of this In sketching this general and necessary attitude towards the art of Watts particularly in the matter of allegory I have taken deliberately these two very famous and obvious pictures and I have occupied equally deliberately a considerable amount of space in expounding them It is far better in a subject so subtle and so bewildering as the relation between art and philosophy that we should see how our conceptions and hypotheses really get on when applied systematically and at some length to some perfectly familiar and existent object A philosopher cannot talk about any single thing down to a pumpkin without showing whether he is wise or foolish but he can easily talk about everything with anyone having any views about him beyond gloomy suspicions But at this point I become fully conscious of another and most important kind of criticism which has been and can be levelled against the allegories of Watts and which must be by the nature of things evoked by the particular line of discussion or reflection that I have here adopted It may be admitted that Watts art is not merely literary in the sense in which I have originally used the term It may be admitted that there is truth in the general position I have sketched out that Watts is not a man copying literature or philosophy but rather a man copying the great spiritual and central realities which literature and philosophy also set out to copy It may be admitted that Mammon is obviously an attempt to portray not a twopenny phrase but a great idea But along with all these admissions it will certainly be said by the most powerful and recent school in art criticism that all this amounts to little more than a difference between a mean and a magnificent blunder Pictorial art it will be said has no more business as such to portray great ideas than small ideas Its affair is with its own technique with the love of a great billowing line for its own sake of a subtle and perfect tint for its own sake If a man mistakes his trade and attends to the technique of another the sublimity of his mind is only a very slight consolation If I summon a paperhanger Illustration DEATH CROWNING INNOCENCE to cover the walls and he insists on playing the piano it matters little whether he plays Beethoven or The Yachmak If I charter a pianist and he is found drinking in the wine cellar it matters little whether he has made his largest hole in good Burgundy or bad Marsala If the whole of this question of great ideas and small ideas of large atmospheres and superficial definitions of the higher and the lower allegory if all this be really irrelevant to the discussion of the position of a painter then indeed we have been upon an idle track As I think I shall show in a moment this is a very inadequate view of the matter But it does draw our attention to an aspect of the matter which must without further delay be discussed That aspect as I need hardly say is the technique of Watts There is of course a certain tendency among all interesting and novel critical philosophers to talk as if they had discovered things which it is perfectly impossible that any human being could ever have denied to shout that the birds fly and declare that in spite of persecution they will still assert that cows have four legs In this way some raw pseudo scientists talk about heredity or the physical basis of life as if it were not a thing embedded in every creed and legend and even the very languages of men In this way some of the new oligarchists of to day imagine they are attacking the doctrine of human equality by pointing out that some men are stronger or cleverer than others as if they really believed that Danton and Washington thought that every man was the same height and had the same brains And something of this preliminary cloud of folly or misunderstanding attaches doubtless to the question of the technical view that is the solely technical view of painting If the principle of art for art s sake means simply that there is a solely technical view of painting and that it must be supreme on its own ground it appears a piece of pure madness to suppose it other than true Surely there never was really a man who held that a picture that was vile in colour and weak in drawing was a good picture because it was a picture of Florence Nightingale Surely there never was really a man who said that when one leg in a drawing was longer than another yet they were both the same length because the artist painted it for an altar piece When the new critics with a burst of music and a rocket shower of epigrams enunciated their new criticism they must at any rate have meant something more than this Undoubtedly they did mean something more they meant that a picture was not a good vehicle for moral sentiment at all they meant that not only was it not the better for having a philosophic meaning but that it was worse This if it be true is beyond all question a real indictment of Watts About the whole of this Watts controversy about didactic art there is at least one perfectly plain and preliminary thing to be said It is said that art cannot teach a lesson This is true and the only proper addition is the statement that neither for the matter of that can morality teach a lesson For a thing to be didactic in the strict and narrow and scholastic sense it must be something about facts or the physical sciences you can only teach a lesson about such a thing as Euclid or the making of paper boats The thing is quite inapplicable to the great needs of man whether moral or sthetic Nobody ever held a class in philanthropy with fifteen millionaires in a row writing cheques Nobody ever held evening continuation classes in martyrdom or drilled boys in a playground to die for their country A Illustration A STORY FROM BOCCACCIO picture cannot give a plain lesson in morals neither can a sermon A didactic poem was a thing known indeed among the ancients and the old Latin civilization but as a matter of fact it scarcely ever professed to teach people how to live the higher life It taught people how to keep bees Since we find therefore that ethics is like art a mystic and intuitional affair the only question that remains is have they any kinship If they have not a man is not a man but two men and probably more if they have there is to say the least of it at any rate a reasonable possibility that a note in moral feeling might have affinity with a note in art that a curve in law so to speak may repeat a curve in draughtsmanship that there may be genuine and not artificial correspondences between a state of morals and an effect in painting This would I should tentatively suggest appear to be a most reasonable hypothesis It is not so much the fact that there is no such thing as allegorical art but rather the fact that there is no art that is not allegorical But the meanings expressed in high and delicate art are not to be classed under cheap and external ethical formul they deal with strange vices and stranger virtues Art is only unmoral in so far as most morality is immoral Thus Mr Whistler when he drops a spark of perfect yellow or violet into some glooming pool of the nocturnal Thames is in all probability enunciating some sharp and wholesome moral comment When the young Impressionists paint dim corners of meadows or splashes of sunlight in the wood this does not mean necessarily that they are unmoral it may only mean that they are a very original and sincere race of stern young moralists Now if we adopt this general theory of the existence of genuine correspondences between art and moral beauty of the existence that is to say of genuine allegories it is perfectly clear wherein the test of such genuineness must consist It must consist in the nature of the technique If the technique considered as technique is calculated to evoke in us a certain kind of pleasure and there is an analogous pleasure in the meaning considered as meaning then there is a true wedding of the arts But if the pleasure in the technique be of a kind quite dissimilar in its own sphere to the pleasure in the spiritual suggestion then it is a mechanical and unlawful union and this philosophy at any rate forbids the banns If the intellectual conceptions uttered in Michel Angelo s Day of Judgment in the Sistine Chapel were the effect of a perfect and faultless workmanship but the workmanship such as we should admire in a Gothic missal or a picture by Gerard Dow we should then say that absolute excellence in both departments did not excuse their being joined The thing would have been a mere accident or convenience Just as two plotters might communicate by means of a bar or two of music so these subtle harmonies of colour and form would have been used for their detached and private ends by the dark conspirators of morality Now there is nothing in the world that is really so thoroughly characteristic of Watts technique as the fact that it does almost startlingly correspond to the structure of his spiritual sense If such pictures as The Dweller in the Innermost and Mammon and Diana and Endymion and Eve Repentant had neither title nor author if no one had heard of Watts or heard of Eve if for the matter of that the pictures had neither human nor animal form it would be possible to guess something of the painter s attitude from the mere colour and line If Watts painted an arabesque it would be moral if he designed a Turkey Illustration LORD LYTTON carpet it would be stoical So individual is his handling that his very choice and scale of colours betray him A man with a keen sense of the spiritual and symbolic history of colours could guess at something about Watts from the mess on his palette He would see giants and the sea and cold primeval dawns and brown earth men and red earth women lying in the heaps of greens and whites and reds like forces in chaos before the first day of creation A certain queer and yet very simple blue there is for instance which is like Titian s and yet not like it which is more lustrous and yet not less opaque and which manages to suggest the north rather than Titian s south in spite of its intensity which suggests also the beginning of things rather than their maturity a hot spring of the earth rather than Titian s opulent summer Then there is that tremendous autochthonous red which was the colour of Adam whose name was Red Earth It is if one may say so the clay in which no one works except Watts and the Eternal Potter There are other colours that have this character a character indescribable except by saying that they come from the palette of Creation a green especially that reappears through portraits allegories landscapes heroic designs but always has the same fierce and elfish look like a green that has a secret It may be seen in the signet ring of Owen Meredith and in the eyes of the Dweller in the Innermost But all these colours have as I say the first and most characteristic and most obvious of the mental qualities of Watts they are simple and like things just made by God Nor is it I think altogether fanciful to push this analogy or harmony a step further and to see in the colours and the treatment of them the other side or typical trait which I have frequently mentioned as making up the identity of the painter He is as I say a stoic therefore to some extent at least a pagan he has no special sympathy with Celtic intensity with Catholic mysticism with Romanticism with all the things that deal with the cells of the soul with agonies and dreams And I think a broad distinction between the finest pagan and the finest Christian point of view may be found in such an approximate phrase as this that paganism deals always with a light shining on things Christianity with a light shining through them That is why the whole Renaissance colouring is opaque the whole Pre Raphaelite colouring transparent The very sky of Rubens is more solid than the rocks of Giotto it is like a noble cliff of immemorial blue marble The artists of the devout age seemed to regret that they could not make the light show through everything as it shows through the little wood in the wonderful Nativity of Botticelli And that is why again Christianity which has been attacked so strangely as dull and austere invented the thing which is more intoxicating than all the wines of the world stained glass windows Now Watts with all his marvellous spirituality or rather because of his peculiar type of marvellous spirituality has the Platonic the philosophic rather than the Catholic order of mysticism And it can scarcely be a coincidence that here again we feel it to be something that could almost be deduced from the colours if they were splashed at random about a canvas The colours are mystical but they are not transparent that is not transparent in the very curious but unmistakable sense in which the colours of Botticelli or Rossetti are transparent What they are can only be described as iridescent A curious lustre or glitter conveyed chiefly by a singular and individual brushwork lies over all his great pictures Illustration DAWN It is the dawn of things it is the glow of the primal sense of wonder it is the sun of the childhood of the world it is the light that never was on sea or land but still it is a light shining on things not shining through them It is a light which exhibits and does honour to this world not a light that breaks in upon this world to bring it terror or comfort like the light that suddenly peers round the corner of some dark Gothic chapel with its green or golden or blood red eyes The Gothic artists as I say would have liked men s bodies to become like burning glass as the figures in their windows do that the light might pass through them There is no fear of light passing through Watts Cain These analogies must inevitably appear fantastic to those who do not accept the general hypothesis of a possible kinship between pictorial and moral harmonies in the psychology of men but to those who do accept this not very extravagant hypothesis it may I think be repeated by way of summary that the purely technical question of Watts colour scheme does provide us at least suggestively with these two parallels Watts so far as his moral and mental attitude can be expressed by any phrases of such brevity has two main peculiarities first a large infantile poetry which delights in things fresh raw and gigantic second a certain Greek restraint and agnostic severity which throws a strong light on this world as it is The colours he uses have also two main peculiarities first a fresh raw and as it were gigantic character secondly an opaque reflected light unlike the medi val lighting a strong light thrown on this world as it is Similar lines of comparison so far as they appear to possess any value could of course be very easily pointed out in connexion with the character of Watts draughtsmanship That his lines are simple and powerful that both in strength and weakness they are candid and austere that they are not Celtic not Catholic and not romantic lines of draughtsmanship would I think appear sufficiently clear to anyone who has any instinct for this mode of judgment at all In the matter of line and composition of course the same general contention applies as in the case of colour The curve of the bent figure of Hope considered simply as a curve half repeating as it does the upper curve of the globe suggests a feeling a sense of fear of simplicity of something which lies near to the nature of the idea itself the idea which inspires the title of the picture The splendid rushing whirlpool of curves which constitutes as it were the ellipse of the two figures in Diana and Endymion is a positive inspiration It is simply as a form for a picture a mere scheme of lines the very soul of Greece It is simple it is full and free it follows great laws of harmony but it follows them swiftly and at will it is headlong and yet at rest like the solid arch of a waterfall It is a rushing and passionate meeting of two superb human figures and it is almost a mathematical harmony Technically at least and as a matter of outlines it is probably the artist s masterpiece Before we quit this second department of the temperament of Watts as expressed in his line mention must be made of what is beyond all question the most interesting and most supremely personal of all the elements in the painter s designs and draughtsmanship That is of course his magnificent discovery of the artistic effect of the human back The back is the most awful and mysterious thing in the universe it is impossible to speak about it It is the part of man that he knows nothing of like an Illustration EVE REPENTANT outlying province forgotten by an emperor It is a common saying that anything may happen behind our backs transcendentally considered the thing has an eerie truth about it Eden may be behind our backs or Fairyland But this mystery of the human back has again its other side in the strange impression produced on those behind to walk behind anyone along a lane is a thing that properly speaking touches the oldest nerve of awe Watts has realized this as no one in art or letters has realized it in the whole history of the world it has made him great There is one possible exception to his monopoly of this magnificent craze Two thousand years before in the dark scriptures of a nomad people it had been said that their prophet saw the immense Creator of all things but only saw Him from behind I do not know whether even Watts would dare to paint that But it reads like one of his pictures like the most terrific of all his pictures which he has kept veiled I need not instance the admirable and innumerable cases of this fine and individual effect Eve Repentant that fine picture in which the agony of a gigantic womanhood is conveyed as it could not be conveyed by any power of visage in the powerful contortion of the muscular and yet beautiful back is the first that occurs to the mind The sad and sardonic picture painted in later years For He had Great Possessions showing the young man of the Gospel loaded with his intolerable pomp of garments and his head sunken out of sight is of course another Others are slighter instances like Good Luck to your Fishing He has again carried the principle in one instance to an extreme seldom adopted I should fancy either by artist or man He has painted a very graceful portrait of his wife in which that lady s face is entirely omitted the head being abruptly turned away But it is indeed idle to multiply these instances of the painter s hobby if one may use the phrase of the worship of the human back when all such instances have been dwarfed and overshadowed by the one famous and tremendous instance that everyone knows Love and Death is truly a great achievement if it stood alone it would have made a man great And it fits in with a peculiar importance with the general view I am suggesting of the Watts technique For the whole picture really hangs both technically and morally upon one single line a line that could be drawn across a blank canvas the spine line of the central figure of Death with its great falling garment The whole composition the whole conception and I was going to say the whole moral of the picture could be deduced from that single line The moral of the picture if moral were the right phrase for these things is it is scarcely necessary to point out the monument of about as noble a silence and suppression as the human mind ever bent itself to in its pride It is the great masterpiece of agnosticism In that picture agnosticism not the cheap and querulous incredulity which abuses the phrase but loyal and consistent agnosticism which is as willing to believe good as evil and to harbour faith as doubt has here its great and pathetic place and symbol in the house of the arts It is the artistic embodiment of reverent ignorance at its highest fully as much as the Divine Comedy is the artistic embodiment of Christianity Technically in a large number of cases it is probably true that Watts portraits or some of them at least are his most successful achievements But here also we find our general conclusion for if his portraits are his best pictures it is certainly not because they Illustration LOVE AND DEATH are merely portraits if they are in some cases better than his symbolic designs it is certainly not because they are less symbolic In his gallery of great men indeed we find Watts almost more himself than anywhere else Most men are allegorical when they are painting allegories but Watts is allegorical when he is painting an old alderman A change passes over that excellent being a change of a kind to which aldermen are insufficiently inured He begins to resolve into the primal elements to become dust and the shadow to become the red clay of Adam and the wind of God His eyes become in spite of his earnest wish the fixed stars in the sky of the spirit his complexion begins to show not the unmeaning red of portraits and miniatures but that secret and living red which is within us and which is the river of man The astounding manner in which Watts has in some cases treated his sitters is one of the most remarkable things about his character He is not it is almost absurd to have to mention such a thing about the almost austere old democrat a man likely to flatter a sitter in any worldly or conventional sense Nor is he for the matter of that a man likely to push compliments far from any motive he is a strict and I should infer a candid man The type of virtues he chiefly admires and practises are the reverse of those which would encourage a courtier or even a universalist But he scarcely ever paints a man without making him about five times as magnificent as he really looks The real men appear if they present themselves afterwards like mean and unsympathetic sketches from the Watts original The fact is that this indescribable primalism which we have noted as coming out in the designs in the titles and in Watts very oil colours is present in this matter in a most extraordinary way Watts does not copy men at all he makes them over again He dips his hand in the clay of chaos and begins to model a man named William Morris or a man named Richard Burton he is assisted no doubt in some degree by a quaint old text book called Reality with its stiff but suggestive woodcuts and its shrewd and simple old hints But the most that can be said for the portraiture is that Watts asks a hint to come and stop with him puts the hint in a chair in his studio and stares at him The thing that comes out at last upon the canvas is not generally a very precise picture of the sitter though of course it is almost always a very accurate picture of the universe And yet while this on the one side is true enough the portraits are portraits and very fine portraits But they are dominated by an element which is the antithesis of the whole tendency of modern art that tendency which for want of a better word we have to call by the absurd name of optimism It is not of course in reality a question of optimism in the least but of an illimitable worship and wonder directed towards the fact of existence There is a great deal of difference between the optimism which says that things are perfect and the optimism which merely says with a more primeval modesty that they are very good One optimism says that a one legged man has two legs because it would be so dreadful if he had not The other optimism says that the fact that the one legged was born of a woman has a soul has been in love and has stood alive under the stars is a fact so enormous and thrilling that in comparison it does not matter whether he has one leg or five One optimism says that this is the best of all possible worlds The other says that it is certainly not the best of all possible worlds but Illustration WILLIAM MORRIS it is the best of all possible things that a world should be possible Watts as has been more than once more or less definitely suggested is dominated throughout by this prehistoric wonder A man to him especially a great man is a thing to be painted as Fra Angelico painted angels on his knees He has indeed like many brilliant men in the age that produced Carlyle and Ruskin an overwhelming tendency to hero worship That worship had not of course in the case of these men any trace of that later and more denaturalized hero worship the tendency to worship madmen to dream of vast crimes as one dreams of a love affair and to take the malformation of the soul to be the only originality To the Carlylean and Watts has been to some by no means inconsiderable extent a Carlylean to the Carlylean the hero the great man was a man more human than humanity itself In worshipping him you were worshipping humanity in a sacrament and Watts seems to express in almost every line of his brush this ardent and reverent view of the great man He overdoes it Tennyson fine as he was both physically and mentally was not quite so much of a demi god as Watts splendid pictures would seem to suggest Many other sitters have been subjected past all recognition to this kind of devout and ethereal caricature But the essential of the whole matter was that the attitude of Watts was one which might almost be called worship It was not of course that he always painted men as handsome in the conventional sense or even as handsome as they were William Morris impressed most people as a very handsome man in Watts marvellous portrait so much is made of the sanguine face the bold stare the almost volcanic suddenness of the emergence of the head from the dark green background that the effect of ordinary good looks on which many of Morris s intimates would probably have prided themselves is in some degree lost Carlyle again when he saw the painter s fine rendering of him said with characteristic surliness that he looked like a mad labourer Conventionally speaking it is of course therefore to be admitted that the sitters did not always come off well But the exaggeration or the distortion if exaggeration or distortion there were was always effected in obedience to some almost awestruck notion of the greatness or goodness of the great or good sitter The point is not whether Watts sometimes has painted men as ugly as they were painted by the primary religious painters the point is as I have said that he painted as they did on his knees Now no one thinks that Mr Sargent paints the Misses Wertheimer on his knees His grimness and decision of drawing and colouring are not due to a sacred optimism But those of Watts are due to this are due to an intense conviction that there is within the sitter a great reality which has to give up its secret before he leaves the seat or the model s throne Hence come the red violent face and minatory eyes of William Morris the painter sought to express and he did most successfully express the main traits and meaning of Morris the appearance of a certain plain masculine passion in the realm of decorative art Morris was a man who wanted good wall papers not as a man wants a coin of the Emperor Constantine which was the cloistered or abnormal way in which men had commonly devised such things he wanted good wall papers as a man wants beer He clamoured for art he brawled for it He asserted the perfectly virile and ordinary character of the appetite for beauty And he possessed and developed a power of moral violence on pure Illustration DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI matters of taste which startled the flabby world of connoisseurship and opened a new era He grew furious with furniture and denounced the union of wrong colours as men denounce an adultery All this is expressed far more finely than in these clumsy sentences in that living and leonine head in the National Portrait Gallery It is exactly the same with Carlyle Watts Carlyle is immeasurably more subtle and true than the Carlyle of Millais which simply represents him as a shaggy handsome magnificent old man The uglier Carlyle of Watts has more of the truth about him the strange combination of a score of sane and healthy visions and views with something that was not sane which bloodshot and embittered them all the great tragedy of the union of a strong countryside mind and body with a disease of the vitals and something like a disease of the spirit In fact Watts painted Carlyle like a mad labourer because Carlyle was a mad labourer This general characteristic might of course be easily traced in all the portraits one by one If space permitted indeed such a process might be profitable for while we take careful note of all the human triviality of faces the one thing that we all tend to forget is that divine and common thing which Watts celebrates It is the misfortune of the nonreligious ages that they tend to cultivate a sense of individuality not only at the expense of religion but at the expense of humanity itself For the modern portrait painter not only does not see the image of God in his sitters he does not even see the image of man His object is not to insist on the glorious and solemn heritage which is common to Sir William Harcourt and Mr Albert Chevalier to Count Tolstoy and Mr Wanklyn that is the glorious and solemn heritage of a nose and two eyes and a mouth The effort of the dashing modern is rather to make each of these features individual almost to the point of being incredible it is his desire to paint the mouth whose grimace is inimitable the eyes that could be only in one head and the nose that never was on sea or land There is value in this purely personal treatment but something in it so constantly lost the quality of the common humanity The new art gallery is too like a museum of freaks it is too wild and wonderful like a realistic novel Watts errs undoubtedly on the other side He makes all his portraits too classical It may seem like a paradox to say that he makes them too human but humanity is a classis and therefore classical He recurs too much to the correct type which includes all men He has for instance a worship of great men so complete that it makes him tend in the direction of painting them all alike There may be too much of Browning in his Tennyson too much of Tennyson in his Browning There is certainly a touch of Manning in his John Stuart Mill and a touch of the Minotaur in many of his portraits of Imperial politicians While he celebrates the individual with a peculiar insight it is nevertheless always referred to a general human type We feel when we look at even the most extraordinary of Watts portraits as for instance the portrait of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe that before Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was born and apart from that fact there was such a thing as a human being When we look at a brilliant modern canvas like that of Mr Sargent s portrait of Wertheimer we do not feel that any human being analogous to him had of necessity existed We feel that Mr Wertheimer might have been created before the stars Watts has a tendency to resume his characters into his background as if they were half returning Illustration THOMAS CARLYLE to the forces of nature In his more successful portraits the actual physical characteristics of the sitter appear to be something of the nature of artistic creations they are decorative and belong to a whole We feel that he has filled in the fiery orange of Swinburne s hair as one might fill in a gold or copper panel We know that he was historically correct in making the hair orange but we cannot get rid of a haunting feeling that if his scheme had been a little different he would have made it green This indescribable sentiment is particularly strong in the case of the portrait of Rossetti Rossetti is dressed in a dark green coat which perfectly expresses his sumptuous Pre Raphaelite affectation But we do not feel that Rossetti has adopted the dark green coat to suit his dark red beard We rather feel that if anyone had seized Rossetti and forcibly buttoned him up in the dark green coat he would have grown the red beard by sheer force of will Before we quit the subject of portraiture a word ought to be said about two exceedingly noble portraits those of Matthew Arnold and Cardinal Manning The former is interesting because as an able critic said somewhere I wish I could remember who he was or where he wrote this is the one instance of Watts approaching tentatively a man whom he in all reasonable probability did not understand In this particular case the picture is a hundred times better for that The portrait painter of Matthew Arnold obviously ought not to understand him since he did not understand himself And the bewilderment which the artist felt for those few hours reproduced in a perfect almost in an immortal picture the bewilderment which the sitter felt from the cradle to the grave The bewilderment of Matthew Arnold was more noble and faithful than most men s certainty and Watts has not failed to give that nobility a place even greater perhaps than that which he would have given to it had he been working on that fixed theory of admiration in which he dealt with Tennyson or Morris The sad sea blue eyes of Matthew Arnold seemed to get near to the fundamental sadness of blue It is a certain eternal bleakness in the colour which may for all I know have given rise to the legend of blue devils There are times at any rate when the bluest heavens appear only blue with those devils The portrait of Cardinal Manning is worth a further and special notice because it is an illustration of the fact to which I have before alluded the fact that while Watts in one sense always gets the best out of his sitters he does not by any means always get the handsomest out of them Manning was a singularly fine looking man even in his emaciation A friend of mine who was particularly artistic both by instinct and habits gazed for a long time at a photograph of the terrible old man clad in those Cardinal s robes and regalia in which he exercised more than a Cardinal s power and said reflectively He would have made his fortune as a model A great many of the photographs of Manning indeed almost any casual glimpses of him present him as more beautiful than he appears in Watts portrait To the ordinary onlooker there was behind the wreck of flesh and the splendid skeleton the remains of a very handsome English gentleman relics of one who might have hunted foxes and married an American heiress Watts has no eyes for anything except that sublime vow which he would himself repudiate that awful Church which he would himself disown He exaggerates the devotionalism of Manning He is more ascetic than the ascetics more Catholic than Catholicism Just so he would be if he were painting the Sheik el Islam more Moslem than the Mohammedans He has no eyes but for ideas Watts allegories and Watts portraits exhaust the subject of his art It is true that he has on rare occasions attempted pictures merely reproducing the externals of the ordinary earth It is characteristic of him that he should have once for no apparent reason in particular painted a picture of two carthorses and a man It is still more characteristic of him that this one picture of a trivial group in the street should be so huge as to dwarf many of his largest and most transcendental canvases that the incidental harmless drayman should be more gigantic than the Prince of this World or Adam or the Angel of Death He condescends to a detail and makes the detail more vast than a cosmic allegory One picture called The First Oyster he is reported to have painted in response to a challenge which accused him or his art of lacking altogether the element of humour The charge is interesting because it suggests a comparison with the similar charge commonly brought against Gladstone In both charges there is an element of truth though not complete truth Watts proved no doubt that he was not wholly without humour by this admirable picture Gladstone proved that he was not wholly without humour by his reply to Mr Chaplin by his singing of Doo dah and by his support of a grant to the Duke of Coburg But both men were singularly little possessed by the mood or the idea of humour To them had been in peculiar fullness revealed the one great truth which our modern thought does not know and which it may possibly perish through not knowing They knew that to enjoy life means to take it seriously There is an eternal kinship between solemnity and high spirits and almost the very name of it is Gladstone Its other name is Watts They knew that not only life but every detail of life is most a pleasure when it is studied with the gloomiest intensity They knew that the men who collect beetles are jollier than the men who kill them and that the men who worshipped beetles in ancient Egypt were probably the jolliest of all The startling cheerfulness of the old age of Gladstone the startling cheerfulness of the old age of Watts are both entirely redolent of this exuberant seriousness this uproarious gravity They were as happy as the birds because like the birds they were untainted by the disease of laughter They are as awful and philosophical as children at play indeed they remind us of a truth true for all of us though capable of misunderstanding that the great aim of a man s life is to get into his second childhood Of his work we have concluded our general survey It has been hard in conducting such a survey to avoid the air of straying from the subject But the greatest hardness of the subject is that we cannot stray from the subject This man has attempted whether he has succeeded or no to paint such pictures of such things that no one shall be able to get outside them that everyone should be lost in them for ever like wanderers in a mighty park Whether we strike a match or win the Victoria Cross we are still giants sprawling in Chaos Whether we hide in a monastery or thunder on a platform we are still standing in the Court of Death If any experience at all is genuine it affects the philosophy of these pictures if any halfpenny stamp supports them they are the better pictures if any dead cat in a dust bin contradicts them they are the worse pictures This is the great pathos and the great dignity of philosophy and theology Men talk of philosophy and theology as if they were something specialistic and arid and Illustration GOOD LUCK TO YOUR FISHING academic But philosophy and theology are not only the only democratic things they are democratic to the point of being vulgar to the point I was going to say of being rowdy They alone admit all matters they alone lie open to all attacks All other sciences may while studying their own laugh at the rag tag and bobtail of other sciences An astronomer may sneer at animalcul which are very like stars an entomologist may scorn the stars which are very like animalcul Physiologists may think it dirty to grub about in the grass botanists may think it dirtier to grub about in an animal s inside But there is nothing that is not relevant to these more ancient studies There is no detail from buttons to kangaroos that does not enter into the gay confusion of philosophy There is no fact of life from the death of a donkey to the General Post Office which has not its place to dance and sing in in the glorious Carnival of theology Therefore I make no apology if I have asked the reader in the course of these remarks to think about things in general It is not I but George Frederick Watts who asks the reader to think about things in general If he has not done this he has failed If he has not started in us such trains of reflection as I am now concluding and many more and many better he has failed And this brings me to my last word Now and again Watts has failed I am afraid that it may possibly be inferred from the magniloquent language which I have frequently and with a full consciousness of my act applied to this great man that I think the whole of his work technically triumphant Clearly it is not For I believe that often he has scarcely known what he was doing I believe that he has been in the dark when the lines came wrong that he has been still deeper in the dark and things came right As I have already pointed out the vague lines which his mere physical instinct would make him draw have in them the curves of the Cosmos His automatic manual action was I think certainly a revelation to others certainly a revelation to himself Standing before a dark canvas upon some quiet evening he has made lines and something has happened In such an hour the strange and splendid phrase of the Psalm he has literally fulfilled He has gone on because of the word of meekness and truth and of righteousness And his right hand has taught him terrible things END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK G F WATTS This file should be named txt or zip This and all

the wilds that they show themselves as they really are As is the case with the majority of proverbs there is much truth in it for without the minor comforts of life to smooth things down and with even the elemental necessities more or less problematical the inner man has an unusual opportunity of showing himself and he is not always attractive A man may be a pleasant companion when you always meet him clad in dry clothes and certain of substantial meals at regulated intervals but the same cheery individual may seem a very different person when you are both on half rations eaten cold and have been drenched for three days sleeping from utter exhaustion cramped and wet My father had done much hunting with many and varied friends I have often heard him say of some one whom I had thought an ideal hunting companion He s a good fellow but he was always fishing about in the pot for the best piece of meat and if there was but one partridge shot he would try to roast it for himself If there was any delicacy he wanted more than his share Things assume such different proportions in the wilds after two months living on palm tree tops and monkeys a ten cent can of condensed milk bought for three dollars from a rubber explorer far exceeds in value the greatest delicacy of the season to the ordinary citizen who has a varied and sufficient menu at his command every day in the year Even as small children father held us responsible to the law of the jungle He would take us out on camping trips to a neck of land four or five miles across the bay from home We would row there in the afternoon the boats laden with blankets and food Then we would make a driftwood fire on which to fry our supper usually bacon and chicken I do not know whether it was the to us wild romance of our position or the keen appetite from the row but never since then have I eaten such bacon Not even the smallest child was allowed to show a disposition to grab or select his pieces of chicken we were taught that that was an unpardonable offense out camping and might cause the culprit to be left behind next time And woe to any one who in clumsily walking about kicked sand into the frying pan After supper we would heap more driftwood on the fire and drape ourselves in our blankets Then we would stretch ourselves out in the sand while father would tell us ghost stories The smallest of us lay within reach of father where we could touch him if the story became too vivid for our nerves and we needed the reassuring feel of his clothes to bring us back to reality There was however a delicious danger in being too near him In stories in which the haunt seized his victim father generally illustrated the action by making a grab at the nearest child After the stories were finished we rolled up in our blankets and thoroughly permeated with sand we slept until the first faint light of dawn Then there was the fire to be built up and the breakfast cooked and the long row home As we rowed we chanted a ballad usually of a seafaring nature it might be The Rhyme of the Three Sealers or The Galley Slave or Simon Danz Father taught us these and many more viva voce when he was dressing for dinner A child was not taken along on these campings out until he was six or seven They took place three or four times a summer and continued until after the African expedition By that time we were most of us away at work scattered far and wide Father always threw himself into our plays and romps when we were small as if he were no older than ourselves and with all that he had seen and done and gone through there was never any one with so fresh and enthusiastic an attitude His wonderful versatility and his enormous power of concentration and absorption were unequalled He could turn from the consideration of the most grave problems of state to romp with us children as if there were not a worry in the world Equally could he bury himself in an exhaustive treatise on the History of the Mongols or in the Hound of the Baskervilles Until father sold his ranches in North Dakota he used to go out West each year for a month or so Unfortunately we were none of us old enough to be taken along but we would wait eagerly for his letters and the recipient of what we called a picture letter gloried in the envy of the rest until another mail placed a substitute upon the pedestal In these picture letters father would sketch scenes and incidents about the ranch or on his short hunting trips We read most of them to pieces unluckily but the other day I came across one of the non picture letters that father wrote me August Out on the prairie I must send my little son a letter too for his father loves him very much I have just ridden into camp on Muley with a prongbuck strapped behind the saddle I was out six hours before shooting it Then we all sat down on the ground in the shade of the wagon and had dinner and now I shall clean my gun and then go and take a bath in a big pool nearby where there is a large flat stone on the edge so I don t have to get my feet muddy I sleep in the buffalo hide bag and I never take my clothes off when I go to bed By the time we were twelve or thirteen we were encouraged to plan hunting trips in the West Father never had time to go with us but we would be sent out to some friend of his like Captain Seth Bullock to spend two or three weeks in the Black Hills or perhaps we would go after duck and prairie chicken with Marvin Hewitt Father would enter into all the plans and go down with us to the range to practise with rifle or shotgun and when we came back we would go over every detail of the trip with him revelling in his praise when he felt that we had acquitted ourselves well Father was ever careful to correct statements to the effect that he was a crack shot He would explain how little being one had to do with success and achievement as a hunter Perseverance skill in tracking quick vision endurance stamina and a cool head coupled with average ability as a marksman produced far greater results than mere skill with a rifle unaccompanied to any marked extent by the other attributes It was the sum of all these qualities each above the average but none emphasized to an extraordinary degree that accounted for father s great success in the hunting field He would point out many an excellent shot at a target who was of no use against game Sometimes this would be due to lack of nerve Father himself was equally cool and unconcerned whether his quarry was a charging lion or a jack rabbit with when it came to the question of scoring a hit the resultant advantage in the size of the former as a target In other instances a good man at the range was not so good in the field because he was accustomed to shooting under conventional and regulated conditions and fell down when it came to shooting under disadvantageous circumstances if he had been running and were winded if he were hungry or wet or tired or feeling the sun if he were uncertain of the wind or the range Sometimes of course a crack shot possesses all the other qualities such is the case with Stewart Edward White whom Cuninghame classified as the best shot with whom he had hunted in all his twenty five years in the wilds Father shot on a par with Cuninghame and a good deal better than I though not as well as Tarleton I have often heard father regret the fact that he did not care for shooting with the shotgun He pointed out that it was naturally the most accessible and least expensive form of hunting His eyesight made it almost impossible for him to attain much skill with a shotgun and although as a boy and young man he went off after duck for sport in later years he never used a shotgun except for collecting specimens or shooting for the pot He continually encouraged us to learn to shoot with the gun In a letter he wrote me to Europe when I was off after chamois he said I have played tennis a little with both Archie and Quentin and have shot with the rifle with Archie and seen that he has practised shotgun shooting with Seaman When my brother and myself were ten and eight respectively father took us and four of our cousins of approximately the same ages to the Great South Bay for a cruise with some fishing and bird shooting thrown in as the guest of Regis Post It was a genuine sacrifice on father s part for he loathed sailing detested fishing and was to say the least lukewarm about bird shooting Rowing was the only method of progression by water for which he cared The trip was a great success however and father enjoyed it more than he anticipated for with the help of our host he instructed us in caring for ourselves and our firearms I had a venerable bore pin fire gun which was the first weapon my father ever owned It was usually known in the family as the rust bore because in the course of its eventful career it had become so pitted and scarred with rust that you could put in as much time as you wished cleaning and oiling without the slightest effect I stood in no little awe of the pin fire because of its recoil when fired and as I was in addition a miserably poor shot my bag on the Great South Bay trip was not large It consisted of one reedbird which father with infinite pains and determination at length succeeded in enabling me to shoot I am sure he never spent more time and effort on the most difficult stalk after some coveted trophy in the West or in Africa Father s hunting experiences had been confined to the United States but he had taken especial interest in reading about Africa the sportsman s paradise When we were small he would read us incidents from the hunting books of Roualeyn Gordon Cumming or Samuel Baker or Drummond or Baldwin These we always referred to as I stories because they were told in the first person and when we were sent to bed we would clamor for just one more a petition that was seldom denied Before we were old enough to appreciate the adventures we were shown the pictures and through Cornwallis Harris s beautiful colored prints in the Portraits of Game and Wild Animals of Southern Africa we soon learned to distinguish the great beasts of Africa The younger Gordon Cumming came to stay with us at Sagamore and when father would get him to tell us hunting incidents from his own varied career we listened enthralled to a really living I story To us he was known as the Elephant Man from his prowess in the pursuit of the giant pachyderm Then there was also the Shark Man He was an Australian who told us most thrilling tales of encounters with sharks witnessed when among the pearl divers I remember vividly his description of seeing a shark attack one of the natives working for him The man was pulled aboard only after the shark had bitten a great chunk from his side and exposed his heart which they could see still beating He said Master master big fish before he died The illustrations in Millais s Breath from the Veldt filled us with delight and to this day I know of no etching that affects me as does the frontispiece by the author s father It is called the Last Trek An old hunter is lying dead beside his ox wagon near him squat two of his Kafir boys and in the distance graze herds of zebra and hartebeeste and giraffe Of the mighty hunters that still survived at that time father admired most Mr F C Selous His books he knew almost by heart Whenever Selous came to the United States he would stay with us and father would sit up till far into the night talking of wild life in the open Selous at sixty five enlisted in the late war as a private he rose to be captain and was decorated with the D S O for gallantry before he fell fighting the Germans in East Africa No one could have devised a more fitting end for the gallant old fellow than to die at the head of his men in a victorious battle on those plains he had roamed so often and loved so well fighting against the worst and most dangerous beast of his generation In father founded a hunting club called the Boone and Crockett after two of the most mighty hunters of America No one was entitled to membership who had not brought down in fair chase three species of American big game The membership was limited to a hundred and I well remember my father s pride when my brother and I qualified and were eventually elected members The club interests itself particularly in the conservation of wild life and the establishment of game refuges Mr Selous and other English hunters were among the associate members In the summer of my father told me that when his term in the White House ended the following spring he planned to make a trip to Africa and that if I wished to do so I could accompany him There was no need to ask whether I wanted to go At school when we were writing compositions mine almost invariably took the form of some imaginary journey across the Dark Continent Still father had ever made it a practice to talk to us as if we were contemporaries He would never order or even tell us to follow a certain line instead he discussed it with us and let us draw our own conclusions In that way we felt that while we had his unreserved backing we were yet acting on our own initiative and were ourselves responsible for the results If a boy is forced to do a thing he often makes but a half hearted attempt to succeed and lays his failure to the charge of the person who forced him although he might well have come through with flying colors had he felt that he was acting on his own responsibility In his discussions with us father could of course shape our opinions in what he thought the proper mould In like manner when it came to taking me to Africa father wanted me to go but he also wanted me to thoroughly understand the pro s and con s He explained to me that it was a holiday that he was allowing himself at fifty after a very busy life that if I went I would have to make up my mind that my holiday was coming at the beginning of my life and be prepared to work doubly hard to justify both him and myself for having taken it He said that the great danger lay in my being unsettled but he felt that taken rightly the experience could be made a valuable asset instead of a liability After we had once finished the discussion and settled that I was to go father never referred to it again He then set about preparing for the expedition Mr Edward North Buxton was another African hunter whom he greatly admired and it was to him and to Selous that he chiefly turned for aid in making his plans It was often said of father that he was hasty and inclined to go off at half cock There was never any one who was less so He would gather his information and make his preparations with painstaking care and then when the moment came to act he was thoroughly equipped and prepared to do so with that lightning speed that his enemies characterized as rash hot headedness Father always claimed that it was by discounting and guarding against all possible causes of failure that he won his successes His last great battle that for preparedness for the part that America the Unready would have to play in the World War was true to his life creed For everything he laid his plans in advance foreseeing as far as was humanly possible each contingency to be encountered For the African expedition he made ready in every way I was at the time at Harvard and almost every letter brought some reference to preparations One day it would be The Winchester rifles came out for trial and all of them were sighted wrong I sent them back with rather an acid letter Then again You and I will be so rusty when we reach Sir Alfred Pease s ranch that our first efforts at shooting are certain to be very bad In March we will practise at Oyster Bay with the until we get what I would call the rifle sense back again and this will make it easier for us when after a month s sea trip we take up the business of hunting A group of thirty or forty of the most famous zoologists and sportsmen presented my father with a heavy double barrelled gun At last I have tried the double barrelled Holland Elephant rifle It is a perfect beauty and it shoots very accurately but of course the recoil is tremendous and I fired very few shots I shall get you to fire it two or three times at a target after we reach Africa just so that you shall be thoroughly familiar with it if or when you use it after big game There is no question that except under extraordinary circumstances it would be the best weapon for elephant rhino and buffalo I think the Winchester will be as good for everything else About all my African things are ready now or will be in a few days I suppose yours are in good trim also a surreptitious dig at a somewhat lackadaisical son I am pursuing my usual plan of taking all the precautions in advance A few days later came another reference to the Holland Holland The double barrelled four fifty shot beautifully but I was paralyzed at the directions which accompanied it to the effect that two shots must always be fired in the morning before starting as otherwise from the freshly oiled barrels the first shot would go high This is all nonsense and I shall simply have to see that the barrels are clean of the oil The recoil of the big gun was so severe that it became a standing joke as to whether we did not fear it more than a charging elephant Father gave the closest attention to every detail of the equipment The first provision lists prepared by his friends in England were drawn up on a presidential scale with champagne and p t de foies gras and all sorts of luxuries These were blue pencilled and two American staples substituted baked beans and canned tomatoes Father always retained the appreciation of canned tomatoes gained in the early ranching days in the West He would explain how delicious he had found it in the Bad Lands after eating the tomatoes to drink the juice from the can In hunting in a temperate climate such as our West a man can get along with but very little and it is difficult to realize that a certain amount of luxury is necessary in the tropics to maintain oneself fit Then too in Africa the question of transportation was fairly simple and almost everywhere we were able to keep ourselves and the porters amply supplied with fresh meat Four years later during the descent of the D vida the River of Doubt we learned to our bitter cost what it meant to travel in the tropics as lightly equipped as one could with but little hardship in the north It was not however through our own lack of forethought but due rather to the necessities and shifting chances of a difficult and dangerous exploring expedition Even if it is true as Napoleon said that an army marches on its belly still it won t go far unless its feet are properly shod and since my father had a skin as tender as a baby s he took every precaution that his boots should fit him properly and not rub The modified duffle bags came all right I suppose we will get the cotton soled shoes but I do not know How do you like the rubber soled shoes Don t you think before ordering other pairs it would be as well to wait until you see the army shoes here which are light and somehow look as if they were more the kind you ordinarily use How many pairs have you now for the African trip and how many more do you think you want Father was fifty years old in the October before we left for Africa and the varied experiences of his vigorous life had as he used to say battered and chipped him One eye was to all intents useless from the effects of a boxing match and from birth he had been so astigmatic as to be absolutely unable to use a rifle and almost unable to find his way in the woods without his glasses He never went off without eight or ten pairs so distributed throughout his kit as to minimize the possibility of being crippled through any ordinary accident Even so any one who has worn glasses in the tropics knows how easily they fog over and how hopeless they are in the rains It was a continual source of amazement to see how skilfully father had discounted this handicap in advance and appeared to be unhampered by it Another serious threat lay in the leg that had been injured when the carriage in which he was driving was run down by a trolley car and the secret service man with him was killed In September he wrote me from Washington I have never gotten over the effects of the trolley car accident six years ago when as you will remember they had to cut down to the shin bone The shock permanently damaged the bone and if anything happens there is always a chance of trouble which would be serious Before I left Oyster Bay while riding I got a rap on the shin bone from a branch This was either the cause or the occasion of an inflammation which had grown so serious when I got back here that Doctor Rixey had to hastily take it in hand For a couple of days it was uncertain whether we would not have to have another operation and remove some of the bones of the leg but fortunately the doctor got it in hand all right and moreover it has enabled me to learn just what I ought to do if I am threatened with similar trouble in Africa His activity however was little hampered by his leg for a few weeks later he wrote I have done very little jumping myself and that only of the small jumps up to four feet because it is evident that I have got to be pretty careful of my leg and that an accident of at all a serious character might throw me out of gear for the African trip This afternoon by the way Archie Butt and I took a scramble down Rock Creek It was raining and the rocks were slippery and at one point I slipped off into the creek but merely bruised myself in entirely safe places not hurting my leg at all When we came to the final and stiffest cliff climb it was so dark that Archie couldn t get up From which it may be seen that neither endurance nor skill suffered as a result of the accident to the leg Still as Bret Harte says We always wink with the weaker eye and when anything went wrong the leg was sure to be implicated Father suffered fearfully with it during the descent of the River of Doubt One of the most constant pictures of father that I retain is at Sagamore after dinner on the piazza He would draw his chair out from the roofed over part to where he could see the moon and the stars When things were black he would often quote Jasper Petulengro in Borrow s Lavengro Life is sweet brother There s day and night brother both sweet things sun moon and stars all sweet things and likewise there s a wind on the heath and would add Yes there s always the wind on the heath From where he sat he looked across the fields to the dark woods and over the tree tops to the bay with the changing twinkling lights of the small craft across the bay to the string of lamps along the causeway leading to Centre Island and beyond that again Long Island Sound with occasionally a tall Fall Steamer light For a while father would drink his coffee in silence and then his rocking chair would start creaking and he would say Do you remember that night in the Sotik when the gun bearers were skinning the big lion or What a lovely camp that was under the big tree in the Lado when we were hunting the giant eland We get three sorts and periods of enjoyment out of a hunting trip The first is when the plans are being discussed and the outfit assembled this is the pleasure of anticipation The second is the enjoyment of the actual trip itself and the third is the pleasure of retrospection when we sit round a blazing wood fire and talk over the incidents and adventures of the trip There is no general rule to know which of the three gives the keenest joy I can think of a different expedition in which each sort stands out in pre eminence Even if the trip has been exceptionally hard and the luck unusually bad the pleasures of anticipation and preparation cannot be taken away and frequently the retrospect is the more satisfactory because of the difficulties and discomforts surmounted I think we enjoyed the African trip most in the actuality and that is saying a great deal It was a wonderful adventure and all the world seemed young Father has quoted in the foreword to African Game Trails I speak of Africa and golden joys It was a line that I have heard him repeat to himself many times In Africa everything was new He revelled in the vast plains blackened with herds of grazing antelope From his exhaustive reading and retentive memory he knew already the history and the habits of the different species of game When we left camp in the early morning we never could foretell what we would run into by nightfall we were prepared for anything from an elephant to a dik dik the graceful diminutive antelope no larger than a hare In the evening after we had eaten we would gather round the camp fire for in the highlands the evenings were chilly and each would tell the adventures of his day and discuss plans for the morrow Then we would start paralleling and comparing Father would illustrate with adventures of the old days in our West Cuninghame from the lore gathered during his twenty years in Africa would relate some anecdote and Mearns would talk of life among the wild tribes in the Philippines Illustration Sir Alfred Pease s sketch of our first giraffe hunt Colonel Mearns belonged to the medical corps in the army He had come with us as an ornithologist for throughout his military career he had been actively interested in sending specimens from wherever he was serving to the Smithsonian National Museum in Washington His mild manner belied his fearless and intrepid disposition A member of the expedition once came into camp with an account of the doctor whom he had just run across looking too benevolent for this world engaged in what our companion described as slaughtering humming birds pursuing them from bush to bush One of his Philippine adventures filled us with a delighted interest for which I don t believe he fully appreciated the reason He told us how with a small force he had been hemmed in by a large number of Moros The Americans took refuge in a stockade on a hilltop The Moros advanced time and again with the greatest gallantry and Mearns explained how sorry he felt for them as they fell some under the very walls of the stockade In a musing tone at the end he added I slipped out of the stockade that night and collected a most interesting series of skulls they re in the Smithsonian to day Father was the rare combination of a born raconteur with the gift of putting in all the little details that make a story and an equally good listener He was an adept at drawing people out His interest was so whole hearted and obvious that the shyest most tongue tied adventurer found himself speaking with entire freedom Every one with whom we came in contact fell under the charm Father invariably thought the best of a person and for that very reason every one was at his best with him and felt bound to justify his confidence and judgment With him I always thought of the Scotch story of the MacGregor who when a friend told him that it was an outrage that at a certain banquet he should have been given a seat half way down the table replied Where the MacGregor sits is the head of the table Where father sat was always the head of the table and yet he treated every one with the same courtesy and simplicity whether it was the governor of the Protectorate or the poorest Boer settler I remember how amazed some were at the lack of formality in his relationship with the members of the expedition Many people who have held high positions feel it incumbent on them to maintain a certain distance in their dealings with their less illustrious fellow men If they let down the barrier they feel they would lose dignity They are generally right for their superiority is not innate but the result of chance With father it was otherwise The respect and consideration felt for him could not have been greater and would certainly not have been so sincere had he built a seven foot barrier about himself He was most essentially unselfish and wanted no more than would have been his just due if the expedition instead of being owing entirely to him both financially and otherwise had been planned and carried out by all of us He was a natural champion of the cause of every man and not only in his books would he carefully give credit where it was due but he would endeavor to bring about recognition through outside channels Thus he felt that Colonel Rondon deserved wide acknowledgment for the years of exploring in the Brazilian Hinterland and he brought it to the attention of the American and British Geographical Societies As a result the former awarded the gold medal to Colonel Rondon In the same way father championed the cause of the naturalists who went with him on his expeditions He did his best to see that the museums to which they belonged should appreciate their services and give them the opportunity to follow the results through When an expedition brings back material that has not been described the museum publishes pamphlets listing the new species and explaining their habitats and characteristics This is rarely done by the man who did the actual collecting Father whenever it was feasible arranged for the naturalists who had accompanied or taken part in the collecting to have the credit of writing the pamphlets describing the results of their work To a layman this would not seem much but in reality it means a great deal Father did all he could to encourage his companions to write their experiences for most of them had led eventful lives filled with unusual incident When as is often the case the actor did not have the power of written narrative father would be the first to recognize it and knew that if inadequately described the most eventful careers may be of no more interest than the catalogue of ships in the Odyssey or the begat chapters in the Bible If however father felt that there existed a genuine ability to write he would spare no efforts to place the articles in some cases he would write introductions and in others reviews of the book if the results attained to that proportion One of the most careful preparations that father made for the African expedition was the choosing of the library He selected as wide a range as possible getting the smallest copy of each book that was obtainable with decent reading type He wanted a certain number of volumes mainly for the contrast to the daily life He told me that he had particularly enjoyed Swinburne and Shelley in ranching days in the Bad Lands because they were so totally foreign to the life and the country and supplied an excellent antidote to the daily round Father read so rapidly that he had to plan very carefully in order to have enough books to last him through a trip He liked to have a mixture of serious and light literature chaff as he called the latter When he had been reading histories and scientific discussions and political treatises for a certain length of time he would plunge into an orgy of detective stories and novels about people cast away on desert islands The plans for the Brazilian expedition came into being so unexpectedly that he could not choose his library with the usual care He brought Gibbon s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in the Everyman s edition and farmed out a volume to each of us and most satisfactory it proved to all He also brought Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus but when he tried to read them during the descent of the Rio da D vida they only served to fill him with indignation at their futility Some translations of Greek plays not those of Gilbert Murray for which he had unstinted praise met with but little better success and we were nearly as badly off for reading matter as we were for provisions I had brought along a selection of Portuguese classics and a number of French novels The former were useless to father but Henri Bordeaux and Maurice Leblanc were grist to the mill It was father s first introduction to Ars ne and he thoroughly enjoyed it he liked the style although for matter he preferred Conan Doyle Father never cared very much about French novels the French books that he read most were scientific volumes histories of the Mongols and an occasional hunting book but he afterward became a great admirer of Henri Bordeaux At last the time came when there was nothing left but the Oxford books of English and French verse The one of English verse he had always disliked He said that if there were to be any American poetry included it should be at any rate a good selection The choice from Longfellow s poems appealed to him as particularly poor and I think that it was for this reason that he disapproved of the whole collection Be that as it may I realized how hard up for something to read father must be when he asked me for my Oxford book of English verse For French verse father had never cared He said it didn t sing sufficiently The Song of Roland was the one exception he granted It was therefore a still greater proof of distress when he borrowed the Oxford book of French verse He always loved to tell afterward that when he first borrowed it he started criticising and I had threatened to take it away if he continued to assail my favorites In spite of all this he found it infinitely preferable to Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius and indeed became very fond of some of the selections Villon and Ronsard particularly interested him When riding along through the wilderness father would often repeat poetry to himself To learn a poem he had only to read it through a few times and he seemed never to forget it Sometimes we would repeat the poem together It might be parts of the Saga of King Olaf or Kipling s Rhyme of the Three Sealers or Grave of a Hundred Head or perhaps The Bell Buoy or again it might be something from Swinburne or Shelley or Keats or the Ballad of Judas Iscariot He was above all fond of the poetry of the open and I think we children got much of our love for the outdoor life not only from actual example but from the poetry that father taught us There was an indissoluble bond between him and any of his old hunting companions and in no matter what part of the world he met them all else was temporarily forgotten in the eager exchange of reminiscences of old days On the return from Africa Seth Bullock of Deadwood met us in London How delighted father was to see him and how he enjoyed the captain s comments on England and things English One of the captain s first remarks on reaching London was to the effect that he was so glad to see father that he felt like hanging his hat on the dome of Saint Paul s and shooting it off We were reminded of Artemus Ward s classic reply to the guard who found him tapping with his cane an inscription in Westminster Abbey Come come sir you mustn t do that It isn t permitted you know Whereupon Artemus Ward turned upon him What mustn t do it If I like it I ll buy it It was never difficult to trail the captain When my sister and I were going through Edinburgh Castle the local guide showed us an ancient gun firing a cluster of five or six barrels With great amusement he told us how an American to whom he was showing the piece a few days previously had remarked that to be shot at with that gun must be like taking a shower bath A few questions served to justify the conclusion we had immediately formed as to the identity of our predecessor Father had him invited to the dinner given by the donors of the Holland Holland elephant rifle Of the hunting comrades of his early days he told me that Mr R H Munro Ferguson was the most satisfactory of all for he met all requirements always good humored when things went wrong possessing a keen sense of humor understanding the value of silent companionship and so well read and informed as to be able to discuss appreciatively any of the multitudinous questions of literature or world affairs that interested my father In Washington when an old companion turned up he would be triumphantly borne off to lunch to find himself surrounded by famous scientists authors senators and foreign diplomats Father would shift with lightning rapidity from one to the other first he might be discussing some question of Indian policy and administration next the attitude of a foreign power then an author s latest novel and a few moments later he would have led on Johnny Goff to telling an experience with the cougar hounds Illustration Father and R H Munro Ferguson at the Elkhorn Ranch after the return from a successful hunting trip Any man who had hunted with father was ready to follow him to the ends of the earth and no passage of time could diminish his loyalty With father the personal equation counted for so much He was so whole heartedly interested in his companions in their aspirations and achievements In every detail he was keenly interested and he would select from his library those volumes which he thought would most interest each companion and perhaps develop in him the love of the wonderful avocation which he himself found in reading His efforts were not always crowned with success Father felt that our African companion R J Cuninghame the Bearded Master as the natives called him being Scotch should be interested in Scott s novels so he selected from the Pigskin Library a copy of one of them Waverley I think it was For some weeks Cuninghame made progress not rapid it is true for he confessed to finding the notes the most interesting part of the book then one day when they were sitting under a tree together in a rest during the noonday heat and father in accordance with his invariable custom took out a book from his saddle pocket R J produced Waverley and started industriously to work on it Father looked over his shoulder to see where he had got to and to his amused delight found that Cuninghame had been losing ground he was three chapters farther back than he had been two weeks before We more than once had occasion to realize how largely the setting is responsible for much that we enjoy in the wilds Father had told me of how he used to describe the bellowing of the bull elk as he would hear it ring out in the frozen stillness of the forests of Wyoming He thought of it and talked of it as a weird romantic call until one day when he was walking through the zoological gardens accompanied by the very person to whom he had so often given the description As they passed the wapitis enclosure a bull bellowed and father s illusions and credit were simultaneously shattered for the romantic call he had so often dwelt upon was in a zoological park nothing more than a loud and discordant sort of bray In spite of this lesson we would see something among the natives that was interesting or unusual and get it to bring home only to find that it was the exotic surroundings that had been responsible for a totally fictitious charm A wild hill tribe in Africa use anklets made from the skin of the colobus a graceful long haired monkey colored black and white When father produced the anklets at home the only thing really noticeable about them was the fact that they smelt Another equally unfortunate case was the affair of the beehives The same hill tribe was very partial to honey An individual s wealth was computed in the number of beehives that he possessed They were made out of hollowed logs three or four feet long and eight or ten inches in diameter A wife or a cow was bought for an agreed upon number of beehives and when we were hunting no matter how hot the trail might be the native tracker would if we came to a clearing and saw some bees hovering about the forest flowers halt and offer up a prayer that the bees should deposit the honey in one of his hives It seemed natural to bring a hive home but viewed in the uncompromising light of the North Shore of Long Island it was merely a characterless uninteresting log Not the least of the many delights of being a hunting companion of father s was his humor No one could tell a better story whether it was what he used to call one of his old grouse in the gunroom stories or an account with sidelights of a contemporaneous adventure The former had to do with incidents in his early career in the cow camps of the Dakotas or later on with the regiment in Cuba and phrases and incidents of them soon became coin current in the expedition Father s humor was never under any circumstances ill natured or of such a sort as might make its object feel uncomfortable If anything amusing occurred to a member of the expedition father would embroider the happening in inimitable fashion but always in such a way that the victim himself was the person most amused The accompanying drawing will serve as illustration Father and I had gone out to get some buck to eke out the food supply for the porters We separated but some time later I caught sight of father and thought I would join him and return to camp I didn t pay particular attention to what he was doing and as he was some way off I failed to notice that he was walking stooped to keep concealed by a rise of ground from some buck he was stalking The result was the picture Illustration An Elderly Parent in the temporary absence of his Affectionate son begins a Cautious Stalk of a buck Illustration Joyful Emotions of the Aff son and the Aff Son s followers on witnessing the Cautious Stalk and preparing to take an Active Part in it Illustration Arrival of Aff Son mixed emotions of Elderly Parent buck in vanishing perspective Before we started on the serious exploring part of the Brazilian trip we paid visits to several fazendas or ranches in the state of Matto Grosso with the purpose of hunting jaguar as well as the lesser game of the country One of the fazendas at which we stayed belonged to the governor of the state When we were wakened before daylight to start off on the hunt we were given in Brazilian fashion the small cup of black coffee and piece of bread which constitutes the native Brazilian breakfast We would then sally forth to return to the ranch not before noon and sometimes much later as the hunting luck dictated We would find an enormous lunch waiting for us at the house Father who was accustomed to an American breakfast remarked regretfully that he wished the lunch were divided or that at least part of it were used to supplement the black coffee of daybreak The second morning as I went down the hall the dining room door was ajar and I caught sight of the table laden with the cold meats and salads that were to serve as part of our elaborate luncheon many dim hours hence I hurried back to tell father and we tiptoed cautiously into the dining room closing the door noiselessly behind us While we were engaged in making rapid despatch of a cold chicken we heard our hosts calling and the next minute the head of the house popped in the door As father said afterward we felt and looked like two small boys caught stealing jam in the pantry The Brazilian exploration was not so carefully planned as the African trip because father had not intended to make much of an expedition The first time he mentioned the idea was in April in reply to a letter I wrote from S o Paulo describing a short hunting expedition that I had made The forest must be lovely some time I must get down to see you and we ll take a fortnight s outing and you shall hunt and I ll act as what in the North Woods we used to call Wangan man and keep camp Four months later he wrote that he was planning to come down and see me that he had been asked to make addresses in Brazil Argentina and Chile and I shall take a naturalist with me if as I hope I return via Paraguay and the Amazon At the time it did not look as if it would be possible for me to go on the trip In father s next letter he said that after he left me instead of returning in the ordinary tourist Bryan Bryce way I am going to see if it is possible to work across from the Plata into the valley of the Amazon and come out through the Brazilian forest This may not be possible It won t be anything like our African trip There will be no hunting and no adventures so that I shall not have the pang I otherwise would about not taking you along These plans were amplified and extended a certain amount but in the last letter I received they didn t include a very serious expedition I shall take the Springfield and the Fox on my trip but I shall not expect to do any game shooting I think it would need the Bwana Merodadi My name among the natives in Africa and not his stout and rheumatic elderly parent to do hunting in the Brazilian forest I shall have a couple of naturalists with me of the Heller stamp and I shall hope to get a fair collection for the New York Museum Fairfield Osborn s museum It was at Rio that father first heard of the River of Doubt Colonel Rondon in an exploring expedition had crossed a large river and no one knew where it went to Father felt that to build dugouts and descend the river offered a chance to accomplish some genuine and interesting exploration It was more of a trip than he had planned for but the Brazilian Government arranged for Colonel Rondon to make up an accompanying expedition When father went off into the wilds he was apt to be worried until he had done something which would in his mind justify the expedition and relieve it from the danger of being a fiasco In Africa he wished to get at least one specimen each of the four great prizes the lion the elephant the buffalo and the rhinoceros It was the lion for which he was most keen and which he also felt was the most problematical Luck was with us and we had not been hunting many days before father s ambition was fulfilled It was something that he had long desired indeed it is the pinnacle of most hunters ambitions so it was a happy cavalcade that rode back to camp in the wake of the natives that were carrying the lioness slung on a long pole The blacks were chanting a native song of triumph and father was singing Whack fa lal for Lannigan s Ball as a sort of chant pagan Illustration Putting the tape on a tusker Reading from left to right unknown gun bearer Kasitura Father Juma Johari Tarlton Cuninghame Father was more fluent than exact in expressing himself in foreign languages As he himself said of his French he spoke it as if it were a non Aryan tongue having neither gender nor tense He would however always manage to make himself understood and never seemed to experience any difficulty in understanding his interlocutor In Africa he had a most complicated combination of sign language and coined words and though I could rarely make out what he and his gun bearer were talking about they never appeared to have any difficulty in understanding each other Father could read Spanish and he had not been in Brazil long before he could make out the trend of any conversation in Portuguese With the Brazilians he always spoke French or on rare occasions German He was most conscientious about his writing Almost every day when he came in from hunting he would settle down to work on the articles that were from time to time sent back to Scribner s This daily task was far more onerous than any one who has not tried it can imagine When you come in from a long day s tramping you feel most uninclined to concentrate on writing a careful and interesting account of the day s activities Father was invariably good humored about it saying that he was paying for his fun In Brazil when the mosquitoes and sand flies were intolerable he used to be forced to write swathed in a mosquito veil and with long gauntlets to protect hands and wrists During the descent of the River of Doubt in Brazil there were many black moments It was impossible to hazard a guess within a month or more as to when we would get through to the Amazon We had dugout canoes and when we came to serious rapids or waterfalls we were forced to cut a trail around to the quiet water below Then we must make a corduroy road with the trunks of trees over which to haul the dugouts All this took a long time and in some places where the river ran through gorges it was almost impossible We lost in all six of the ten canoes with which we started and of course much of our food supply and general equipment It was necessary to delay and build two more canoes a doubly laborious task because of the axes and adzes which had gone down in the shipwrecks The Brazil nuts upon which we had been counting to help out our food supply had had an off year If this had not been so we would have fared by no means badly for these nuts may be ground into flour or roasted or prepared in a number of different ways Another source upon which we counted failed us when we found that there were scarcely any fish in the river For some inexplicable reason many of the tributaries of the Amazon teem with fish while others flowing through similar country and under parallel conditions contain practically none We went first onto half rations and then were forced to still further reduce the issue We had only the clothes in which we stood and were wet all day and slept wet throughout the night There would be a heavy downpour then out would come the sun and we would be steamed dry only to be drenched once more a half hour later Illustration Launching a newly made dugout on the D vida Working waist deep in the water in an attempt to dislodge a canoe that had been thrown upon some rocks out in the stream father slipped and of course it was his weak leg that suffered Then he came down with fever and in his weakened condition was attacked with a veritable plague of deep abscesses It can be readily understood that the entourage and environment were about as unsuitable for a sick man as any that could be imagined Nothing but father s indomitable spirit brought him through He was not to be downed by anything although he knew well that the chances were against his coming out He made up his mind that as long as he could he would go along but that once he could no longer travel and held up the expedition he would arrange for us to go on without him Of course he did not at the time tell us this but he reasoned that with our very limited supply of provisions and the impossibility of living on the country if the expedition halted it would not only be of no avail as far as he was concerned but the chances would be strongly in favor of no one coming through With it all he was invariably cheerful and in the blackest times ever ready with a joke Sick as he was he gave no one any trouble He would walk slowly over the portages resting every little while and when the fever was not too severe we would when we reached the farther end with the canoes find him sitting propped against a tree reading a volume of Gibbon or perhaps the Oxford book of verse There was one particularly black night one of our best men had been shot and killed by a useless devil who escaped into the jungle where he was undoubtedly killed by the Indians We had been working through a series of rapids that seemed interminable There would be a long carry a mile or so clear going and then more rapids The fever was high and father was out of his head Doctor Cajazeira who was one of the three Brazilians with us divided with me the watch during the night The scene is vivid before me The black rushing river with the great trees towering high above along the bank the sodden earth under foot for a few moments the stars would be shining and then the sky would cloud over and the rain would fall in torrents shutting out sky and trees and river Father first began with poetry over and over again he repeated In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree then he started talking at random but gradually he centred down to the question of supplies which was of course occupying every one s mind Part of the time he knew that I was there and he would then ask me if I thought Cherrie had had enough to eat to keep going Then he would forget my presence and keep saying to himself I can t work now so I don t need much food but he and Cherrie have worked all day with the canoes they must have part of mine Then he would again realize my presence and question me as to just how much Cherrie had had How good faithful Cajazeira waked I do not know but when his watch was due I felt him tap me on the shoulder and crawled into my soggy hammock to sleep the sleep of the dead Father s courage was an inspiration never to be forgotten by any of us without a murmur he would lie while Cajazeira lanced and drained the abscesses When we got down beyond the rapids the river widened so that instead of seeing the sun through the canyon of the trees for but a few hours each day it hung above us all the day like a molten ball and broiled us as if the river were a grid on which we were made fast To a sick man it must have been intolerable It is when one is sick that one really longs for home Lying in a hammock all unwashed and unshaven suffocating beneath a mosquito net or tortured by mosquitoes and sand flies when one raises the net to let in a breath of air it is then that one dreams of clean pajamas and cool sheets and iced water I have often heard father say when he was having a bout of fever at home that it was almost a pleasure to be ill particularly when you thought of all the past discomforts of fever in the wilds Father s disappointment at not being able to take a physical part in the war as he has said to pay with his body for his soul s desire was bitter Strongly as he felt about going I doubt if his disappointment was much more keen than that of the British and French statesmen and generals who so readily realized what his presence would mean to the Allied cause and more than once requested in Washington that he be sent Marshal Joffre made such a request in person meeting with the usual evasive reply Father took his disappointment as he had taken many another in his life without letting it harm his usefulness or discourage his aggressive energy In the fell clutch of circumstance he did not wince or cry aloud Indeed the whole of Henley s poem might well apply to father if it were possible to eliminate from it the unfortunate marring undercurrent of braggadocio with which father s attitude was never for an instant tinged With the indomitable courage that knew no deterrent he continued to fight his battle on this side to make America s entry no empty action as it threatened to be He wrote me that he had hoped that I would be with him in this greatest adventure of all but that since it was not to be he could only be thankful that his four boys were permitted to do their part in the actual fighting When in a little town in Germany my brother and I got news of my father s death there kept running through my head with monotonous insistency Kipling s lines He scarce had need to doff his pride Or slough the dress of earth E en as he trod that day to God So walked he from his birth In simpleness and gentleness and honor and clean mirth That was my father to whose comradeship and guidance so many of us look forward in the Happy Hunting Grounds II In Quest of Sable Antelope II IN QUEST OF SABLE ANTELOPE It was a bright sunny day toward the end of October and I was walking along the streets of the old Portuguese town of Mombasa on the east coast of Equatorial Africa Behind me in ragged formation marched some twenty five blacks all but four of them with loads on their heads the four were my personal boys two gun bearers a cook and a tent boy They were scattered among the crowd hurrying up those that tried to lag behind for a last farewell to the wives and sweethearts who were following along on either side clad in the dark blue or more gaudily colored sheets that served them for clothes At length our heterogeneous assembly reached the white sands of the harbor and amid much confusion we stowed away into a couple of long broad dugouts and were ferried out to a dhow that lay moored not far from the shore We set sail amid the shrill cries of the women and a crowd of small children who on our approach had scurried out of the water like so many black monitor lizards We steered out across the bay toward a headland some two miles distant There was just enough breeze to ruffle the water but the dhow sped along at a rate that belied appearances Sprawling among their loads the men lit cigarettes and chatted and joked talking of the prospects of the trip or the recent gossip of Mombasa The sailors not knowing that I understood Swahili began to discuss me in loud tones An awkward silence fell upon the porters who didn t quite know how to tell them Mali my tent boy who was sitting near me looked toward me and smiled When the discussion became a little too personal I turned to him and made a few pertinent remarks about the crew The porters grinned delightedly and rarely have I seen more shamefaced men than those sailors In far too short a time for all of us the dhow grounded on the other side and we jumped out and started to unload A giant baobab tree stood near the beach a cluster of huts beneath it were occupied by some Swahilis who fished and ran a small store where my porters laid in a final supply of delicacies sugar and tobacco It is customary to have a native head man but on this short trip I had decided to do without one for though the porters were new my personal boys were old friends Accordingly when all the loads were ready and neatly arranged in line I shouted Bandika Great muscular black arms caught the packs and swung them up into place on the head and off we started along the old coast trail worn deep with the traffic of centuries and leading on for several hundred miles with native villages strung along its length Behind me strode my two gun boys then came the porters all in single file their present regular order a strong contrast with our disordered progress through the streets of Mombasa Mali and Kombo the cook brought up the rear to look out for stragglers and help unfortunates to rearrange their loads more comfortably A little way from the shore we passed an old Arab well some women were drawing water from it but at our approach they deserted their earthen jars and hurried away with shrill ejaculations Fresh from the more arid interior I imagined that the men would fill their gourds but they filed past without stopping for this was a land of many streams We continued on our way silently now through stretches of sandy land covered with stunted bushes now through native shambas or cultivated fields until we came upon a group of natives seated under a gigantic wide spreading tree It was a roadside shop and the porters threw down their loads and shouldered their way to where the shopkeeper was squatting behind his wares nuts tobacco tea bits of brass wire beads and sweetmeats of a somewhat gruesome appearance He was a striking looking old fellow with a short gray beard Pretty soon he came to where I was sitting with a measure of nuts for the white man so in return I took out my tobacco pouch and presented him with some of the white man s tobacco After a few minutes rest we set out again and marched along for some time until we came to a cocoanut palm grove where I decided to camp for the night The natives we were among were called the WaNyika the children of the wilderness Leaving the men to arrange camp under the supervision of the gun bearers I strolled over to a nearby village where there was a dance in full swing The men were regaling themselves with cocoanut wine an evil tasting liquid made from fermented cocoanut milk they told me The moon almost at full was rising when I returned to camp and after supper I sat and smoked and watched the night and the palms in the moonlight until the local chief or Sultani as they called him came up and presented me with some ripe cocoanuts and sitting down on the ground beside me he puffed away at his long clay pipe coughing and choking over the strong tobacco I had given him but apparently enjoying it all immensely When he left I remained alone unable for some time to make up my mind to go to bed such was the spell of the tropic moonlight and the distant half heard songs of the dancing children of the wilderness Illustration A relic of the Portuguese occupation an old well beside the trail Early next morning we were on our way and that night were camped a few hundred yards from the village of a grizzled old Sultani whose domains lay in the heart of the sable country for it was in search of these handsome antelopes that I had come In southern Africa the adult males of the species are almost black with white bellies but here they were not so dark in color resembling more nearly the southern female sable which is a dark reddish brown Both sexes carry long horns that sweep back in a graceful curve over the shoulders those of the male much heavier and longer sometimes in the south attaining five feet in length The sable antelope is a savage animal and when provoked will attack man or beast The rapier like horns prove an effective weapon as many a dog has learned to its cost My tent was pitched beneath one of the large shade trees in which the country abounds This one was the village council tree and when I arrived the old men were seated beneath it on little wooden stools These were each hacked out of a single log and were only five or six inches high The owner carried his stool with him wherever he went slinging it over his shoulder on a bit of rawhide or a chain There was trouble in the village for after the first formal greetings were over the old chief told me that one of his sons had just died There was about to be held a dance in his memory and he led me over to watch it We arrived just as the ceremony was starting Only small boys were taking part in it and it was anything but a mournful affair for each boy had strung round his ankles baskets filled with pebbles that rattled in time with the rhythm of the dance In piping soprano they sang a lively air which unlike any native music I had hitherto heard sounded distinctly European and would scarcely have been out of place in a comic opera Illustration The Death Dance of the Wa Nyika children in memory of the chieftain s little son When the dance was finished the Sultani came back with me to my tent and sitting down on his stool beside me we gossiped until I was ready to go to bed I had given him a gorgeous green umbrella and a most meritorious knife promising him further presents should success attend me in the chase He in addition to the customary cocoanuts had presented me with some chickens and a large supply of a carrot shaped root called mihogo by no means a bad substitute for potatoes and eaten either raw or cooked having in the former state a slight chestnut flavor The first day s hunting was a blank for although we climbed hill after hill and searched the country with my spy glasses we saw nothing but some kongoni hartebeeste and I had no intention of risking disturbing the country by shooting at them much as the men would have liked the meat It was the rainy season and we were continually getting drenched by showers but between times the sun would appear and in an incredibly short time we would be dry again The Sultani had given me two guides sturdy cheerful fellows with no idea of hunting but knowing the country well which was all we wanted We loaded them down with cocoanuts for in the middle of the day when one was feeling tired and hot it was most refreshing to cut a hole in a cocoanut and drink the milk eating the meat afterward The following day we made a very early start leaving camp amid a veritable tropical downpour For half an hour we threaded our way through the semi cultivated native shambas the rain soon stopped the sun rose and we followed an overgrown trail through a jungle of glistening leaves Climbing a large hill we sat down among some rocks to reconnoitre Just as I was lighting my pipe I saw Juma Yohari one of my gun bearers motioning excitedly I crept over to him and he pointed out three quarters of a mile away a small band of sable crossing a little open space between two thickets The country was difficult to hunt for it was so furrowed with valleys down the most of which there ran streams that there was very little level land and that little was in the main bush country the Bara as the natives called it There were however occasional open stretches but during the rainy season as at present the grass was so high everywhere that it was difficult to find game We held a hurried consultation Juma Kasitura my other gun bearer and myself after a short disagreement we decided upon the course and set out as fast as we safely could toward the point agreed on It was exhausting work through ravines up hills all amid a tangle of vines and thorns and once among the valleys it was hard to know just where we were When we reached what we felt was the spot we had aimed at we could find no trace of our quarry though we searched stealthily in all directions I led the way toward a cluster of tall palms that were surrounded by dense undergrowth A slight wind rose and as I entered the thicket with every nerve tense I heard a loud and most disconcerting crackle that caused me to jump back on to Yohari who was close behind me He grinned and pointed to some great dead palm leaves pendant along the trunk of one of the trees that the wind had set in motion The next instant I caught sight of a pair of horns moving through the brush On making out the general outline of the body I fired Another antelope that I had not seen made off and taking it for a female I again fired bringing it down with a most lucky shot I had hoped to collect male female and young for the museum so I was overjoyed believing that I had on the second day s hunting managed to get the two adults Yohari and Kasitura thought the same but when we reached our quarry we found them to be both males the latter a young one and the former although full grown in body by no means the tawny black color of an old bull We set to work on the skins and soon had them off Juma took one of the Shenzies and went back to camp with the skins while Kasitura and I went on with the other We returned to camp by moonlight that night without having seen any more game The porters had gone out and brought in the meat and there was a grand feast in progress After some antelope steak and a couple of cups of tea I tumbled into bed and was soon sound asleep The next thing I knew I was wide awake feeling as if there were fourscore pincers at work on me Bounding out of bed I ran for the camp fire which was still flickering I was covered with ants They had apparently attacked the boys sleeping near me at about the same time for the camp was in an uproar and there was a hurrying of black figures and a torrent of angry Swahili imprecations There was nothing for it but to beat an ignominious retreat and we fled in confusion Once out of reach of reinforcements we soon ridded ourselves of such of our adversaries as were still on us Fortunately for us the assault had taken place not long before dawn and we returned to camp safely by daylight That day we moved camp to the top of a neighboring hill about a mile from the village I spent the morning working over the skins which I had only roughly salted the night before but in the afternoon we sallied forth again to the hunt We went through several unsuccessful days before I again came up with sable Several times we had met with fresh tracks and in each case Kasitura who was a strapping Basoga from a tribe far inland and an excellent tracker took up the trail and did admirable work The country was invariably so dense and the game so wary that in spite of Kasitura s remarkable tracking only on two occasions did we sight the quarry and each time it was only a fleeting glimpse as they crashed off I could have had a shot but I was anxious not to kill anything more save a full grown female or an old master bull and it was impossible to determine either sex or age On what was to be our last day s hunting we made a particularly early start and pushed on and on through the wild bushland stopping occasionally to spy round from some vantage point We would swelter up a hill down into the next valley among the lovely tall trees that lined the brook cross the cool rock strewn stream and on again The sable fed in the open only in the very early morning till about nine o clock then they would retreat into the thickets and doze until four or five in the afternoon when they would again come out to feed During the intervening time our only chance was to run across them by luck or find fresh tracks to follow On that particular day we climbed a high hill about noon to take a look round and have a couple of hours siesta I found a shady tree and sat down with my back against the trunk Ten miles or so away sparkled and shimmered the Indian Ocean On all sides stretched the wonderful bushland here and there in the distance broken by little patches of half cultivated land There had been a rain storm in the morning but now the sun was shining undimmed Taking from my hunting coat pocket Borrow s Wild Wales I was soon climbing far distant Snowdon with Lavengro and was only brought back to realities by Juma who came up to discuss the afternoon s campaign We had scarcely begun when one of the Shenzies whom I had sent to watch from a neighboring hill came up in great excitement to say that he had found a large sable bull We hurried along after him and presently he pointed to a thicket ahead of us Leaving the rest behind Juma and I proceeded cautiously toward the thicket We found two sable cows which Juma felt sure were all that there were in the thicket whereas I could not help putting some faith in the Shenzi who had been very insistent about the big bull I was convinced at length that Juma was right so I took aim at the better of the cows My shooting was poor for I only crippled her and when I moved up close for a final shot she attempted to charge snorting savagely but too badly hit to cause any trouble We had spent some time searching for the bull so that by the time we had the skin off the brief African twilight was upon us We had been hunting very hard for the last week and were all of us somewhat fagged but as we started toward camp I soon forgot my weariness in the magic of the night Before the moon rose we trooped silently along no one speaking but all listening to the strange noises of the wilderness We were following a rambling native trail which wound along a deep valley beside a stream for some time before it struck out across the hills for camp There was but little game in the country still occasionally we would hear a buck that had winded us crashing off or some animal splashing across the stream In the more open country the noise of the cicadas loud and incessant took me back to the sound of the katydids in summer nights on Long Island The moon rose large and round outlining the tall ivory nut palms It was as if we were marching in fairyland and with real regret I at length caught the gleam of the camp fire through the trees Illustration Across the bay from Mombasa the porters ready to shoulder loads and march It was after ten o clock when we had had something to eat but Juma Kasitura and I gathered to work on the sable and toiled until we began to nod off to sleep as we skinned Next morning I paid my last visit to the old Sultani rewarding him as I had promised and solemnly agreeing to come back and live with him in his country The porters were joyful as is always the case when they are headed for Mombasa Each thought of the joyous time he would have spending his earnings and they sang in unison as they swung along the trail careless happy children I too was in the best of spirits for my quest had been successful and I was not returning empty handed III The Sheep of the Desert III THE SHEEP OF THE DESERT I wished to hunt the mountain sheep of the Mexican desert hoping to be able to get a series needed by the National Museum At Yuma on the Colorado River in the extreme southwestern corner of Arizona I gathered my outfit Doctor Carl Lumholtz the explorer had recently been travelling and hunting in that part of Mexico In addition to much valuable help as to outfitting he told me how to get hold of a Mexican who had been with him and whom he had found trustworthy The postmaster Mr Chandler and Mr Verdugo a prominent business man had both been more than kind in helping in every possible way Mr Charles Utting clerk of the District Court sometime Rough Rider and inveterate prospector was to start off with me for a short holiday from judicial duties To him the desert was an open book and from long experience he understood all the methods and needs of desert travel Mr Win Proebstel ranchman and prospector was also to start with us He had shot mountain sheep all the way from Alaska to Mexico and was a mine of first hand information as to their habits and seasons I had engaged two Mexicans Cipriano Dominguez and Eustacio Casares On the afternoon of the th of August we reached Wellton a little station on the Southern Pacific some forty miles east of Yuma Win and his brother Ike Proebstel were ready with a wagon which the latter was to drive to a water hole some sixteen miles south near some mining claims of Win s August is the hottest month in the year in that country a time when on the desert plains of Sonora the thermometer marks degrees so we decided to take advantage of a glorious full moon and make our first march by night We loaded as much as we could of our outfit into the wagon so as to save our riding and pack animals We started at nine in the evening The moon rode high At first the desert stretched in unbroken monotony on all sides to the dim and far off mountains In a couple of hours we came to the country of the saguaro the giant cactus All around us their shafts forty or fifty feet high with occasional branches set at grotesque angles to the trunk they rose from the level floor of the desert ghostly in the moonlight The air seemed cool in comparison with the heat of the day though the ground was still warm to the touch Shortly before one in the morning we reached Win s water hole tank in the parlance of the country and were soon stretched out on our blankets fast asleep Next day we loaded our outfit on our two pack mules and struck out across the desert for the Tinajas Altas High Tanks which lay on the slopes of a distant range of mountains about four miles from the Mexican border For generations these tanks have been a well known stepping stone in crossing the desert There are a series of them worn out in the solid rock and extending up a cleft in the mountainside which in time of rain becomes the course of a torrent The usual camping place is a small plateau a couple of hundred yards from the lowest tank This plateau lies in a gulch and is sheltered on either hand by its steep and barren sides A few hundred feet from the entrance on the desert and scattered about among the cactus lie some hundred and fifty graves the graves of men who have died of thirst for this is a grim land and death dogs the footsteps of those who cross it Most of the dead men were Mexicans who had struggled across the deserts only to find the tanks dry Each lay where he fell until sooner or later some other traveller found him and scooped out for him a shallow grave and on it laid a pile of rocks in the shape of a rude cross Forty six unfortunates perished here at one time of thirst They were making their way across the deserts to the United States and were in the last stages of exhaustion for lack of water when they reached these tanks But a Mexican outlaw named Blanco reached the tanks ahead of them and bailed out the water after carefully laying in a store for himself not far away By this cache he waited until he felt sure that his victims were dead he then returned to the tanks gathered the possessions of the dead and safely made his escape A couple of months previously a band of insurrectos had been camped by these tanks and two newly made graves marked their contribution The men had been killed in a brawl Utting told us of an adventure that took place here a few years ago which very nearly had a tragic termination It was in the winter season and there was an American camped at the tanks when two Mexicans came there on their way to the Tule tanks twenty five miles away near which they intended to do some prospecting Forty eight hours after they had left one of them turned up riding their pack mule and in a bad way for water He said that they had found the Tule tanks dry but had resolved to have one day s prospecting anyway they had separated but agreed at what time they were to meet Although he waited for a long while after the agreed time his companion never appeared and he was forced to start back alone Twenty four hours after the return of this Mexican the American was awakened in the night by hearing strange sounds in the bed of the arroyo When he went down to investigate them he found the lost Mexican he was in a fearful condition totally out of his head and was vainly struggling to crawl up the bank of the arroyo in order to make the last hundred yards across the plateau to the water hole He would never have reached it alone By careful treatment the American brought him round and then listened to his story He had lost himself when he went off prospecting and when he finally got his bearings he was already in a very bad way for water Those dwelling in cool well watered regions can hardly make themselves realize what thirst means in that burning desert He knew that although there was no water in the Tule wells there was some damp mud in the bottom and he said that all he wished to do was to reach the wells and cool himself off in the mud before he died A short distance from the tanks the trail he was following divided one branch leading to the Tule wells and the other back to the Tinajas Altas twenty five miles away The Mexican was so crazed that he took the wrong branch and before he realized his mistake he had gone some way past Tule he then decided that it was the hand of providence that had led him past and that he must try to make Tinajas Altas a feat which he would have just missed accomplishing but for the American encamped there The morning after we reached the tanks the Tinah alta as they are called colloquially Win and I were up and off for the hunting grounds by half past three by sun up we were across the border and hunted along the foot of the mountains climbing across the out jutting ridges At about nine we reached the top of a ridge and began looking around Win called to me that he saw some sheep We didn t manage things very skilfully and the sheep took fright but as they stopped I shot at a fine ram Win s rifle echoing my shot We neither of us scored a hit and missed several running shots This missing was mere bad luck on Win s part for he was a crack shot and later on that day when we were not together he shot a ram only part of which was visible at a distance of three hundred and fifty yards As the sun grew hotter we hunted farther up on the mountains but we saw no more sheep and returned to camp with Utting who met us at a ravine near the border Illustration A desert camp in old Mexico After we got back to camp Win and I filled some canteens threw our blankets on one of the pack mules took Dominguez and rode back over the border to camp in the dry bed of an arroyo near where we had been hunting in the morning We sent back the animals arranging with Dominguez to return with them the following day Next morning at a little after three we rolled out of our blankets built a little fire of mesquite wood and after a steaming cup of coffee and some cold frying pan bread we shouldered our rifles and set out At the end of several hours steady walking I got a chance at a fair ram and missed I sat down and took out my field glasses to try to see where he went and I soon picked up three sheep standing on a great boulder near the foot of a mountain of the same range that we were on They were watching us and were all ewes but I wanted one for the museum So I waited till they lost interest in us got down from the rock and disappeared from our sight I then left Win and started toward the boulder after some rather careful stalking I got one of them at about two hundred yards by some fairly creditable shooting The side of the mountain range along which we were hunting was cut by numerous deep gullies from two to three hundred yards across After I had dressed the ewe I thought I would go a little way farther on the chance of coming upon the ram I had missed for he had disappeared in that direction When I had crossed three or four ridges I sat down to look around It was about half past nine the heat was burning and I knew the sheep would soon be going up the mountains to seek the shelter of the caves in which they spend the noonday hours Suddenly I realized that there were some sheep on the side of the next ridge standing quietly watching me There were four bunches scattered among the rocks three were of ewes and young and there was one bunch of rams in all there were sixteen sheep I picked out the best ram and estimating the distance at two hundred and fifty yards I fired hitting but too low I failed to score in the running shooting but when he was out of sight I hurried over and picked up the trail he was bleeding freely and it was not difficult to follow him He went half a mile or so and then lay down in a rock cave but he was up and off before I could labor into sight and made a most surprising descent down the side of a steep ravine When I caught sight of him again he was half way up the opposite wall of the ravine though only about a hundred yards distant he was standing behind a large rock with only his quarters visible but one more shot brought matters to a finish The heat was very great so I started right to work to get the skin off A great swarm of bees gathered to the feast They were villainous looking and at first they gave me many qualms but we got used to each other and I soon paid no attention to them merely brushing them off any part that I wanted to skin I was only once stung and that was when a bee got inside my clothing and I inadvertently squeezed it Before I had finished the skinning I heard a shot from Win I replied and a little while afterward he came along I shall not soon forget packing the skin with the head and the leg bones still in it down that mountainside In addition to being very heavy it made an unwieldy bundle as I had no rope with which to tie it up I held the head balanced on one shoulder with a horn hooked round my neck the legs I bunched together as best I could but they were continually coming loose and causing endless trouble After I reached the bottom I left Win with the sheep and struck off for our night s camping place It was after eleven and the very hottest part of the day I had to be careful not to touch any of the metal part of my gun indeed the wooden stock was unpleasantly hot and I was exceedingly glad that there was to be water waiting for me at camp I got Dominguez and the horses and brought in the sheep which took several hours That afternoon we were back at Tinah alta with a long evening s work ahead of me skinning out the heads and feet by starlight Utting who was always ready to do anything at any time and did everything well turned to with a will and took the ewe off my hands The next day I was hard at work on the skins One of the tanks about four hundred yards from camp was a great favorite with the sheep and more than once during our stay the men in camp saw sheep come down to drink at it This had generally happened when I was off hunting but on the morning when I was busy with the skins two rams came down to drink It was an hour before noon for at this place the sheep finished feeding before they drank The wind was blowing directly up the gulch to them but although they stopped several times to stare at the camp they eventually came to the water hole and drank Of course we didn t disturb these sheep for not only were they in the United States but they were drinking at a water hole in a desert country and a man who has travelled the deserts and is any sort of a sportsman would not shoot game at a water hole unless he were in straits for food I had been hunting on the extreme end of the Gila Range and near a range called El Viejo Hombre The Old Man After I shot my ram in the confusion that followed two of the young rams broke back came down the mountain passing quite close to Win and crossed the plain to the Viejo Hombre Range some mile and a half away The bands of sheep out of which I shot my specimens had been feeding chiefly on the twigs of a small symmetrical bush called by the Mexicans El Yervo del Baso the same I believe that Professor Hornaday in his Camp Fires on Desert and Lava calls the white Brittle bush They had also been eating such galleta grass as they could find it was on this grass that we depended for food for our horses and mules Apparently the sheep of these bands had not been going to the water hole there were numerous places where they had been breaking down cactus and eating the pulp In this country Win said that the rams and the ewes began to run together in October and that in February the young were born When the rams left the ewes they took with them the yearling rams and they didn t join the ewes again until the next October On the following day I left Utting and Proebstel and took the trail to the Tule tank The two Mexicans were with me and we had two horses and three mules We were travelling very light for we were bound for a country where water holes were not only few and far between but most uncertain My personal baggage consisted of my washing kit an extra pair of shoes a change of socks and a couple of books Besides our bedding we had some coffee tea sugar rice flour with a little bacon to take the place of lard in making bread and a good supply of frijoles or Mexican beans It was on these last that we really lived As soon as we got to a camp we always put some frijoles in a kettle and started a little fire to boil them If we were to be there for a couple of days we put in enough beans to last us the whole time and then all that was necessary in getting a meal ready was to warm up the beans It was between four and five in the afternoon when we left Tinah alta and though the moon did not rise until late the stars were bright and the trail was clear The desert we were riding through was covered with mesquite and creosote and innumerable choya cactus there were also two kinds of prickly pear cactus and ocatillas were plentiful The last are curious plants they are formed somewhat on the principle of an umbrella with a very short central stem from which sometimes as many as twenty spokes radiate umbrella wise These spokes are generally about six feet long and are covered with thorns which are partially concealed by tiny leaves The flower of the ocatilla is scarlet and although most of them had stopped flowering by August there were a few still in bloom After about six hours silent riding we reached Tule The word means a marsh but needless to say all that we found was a rock basin with a fair supply of water and a very generous supply of tadpoles and water lice Next morning when we came to get breakfast ready we found we had lost through a hole in a pack sack all of our eating utensils except a knife and two spoons but we were thankful at having got off so easily By three in the afternoon we were ready for what was to be our hardest march We wished to get into the Pinacate country and our next water was to be the Papago tank which Casares said was about forty five miles south of us He said that in this tank we were always sure to find water For the first fifteen miles our route lay over the Camino del Diablo a trail running through the Tule desert and it has proved indeed a road of the devil for many an unfortunate Then we left the trail the sun sank twilight passed and in spite of the brilliancy of the stars the going became difficult In many places where the ground was free from boulders the kangaroo rats had made a network of tunnels and into these our animals fell often sinking shoulder deep Casares was leading riding a hardy little white mule While he rode he rolled cigarette after cigarette and as he bent forward in his saddle to light them for a moment his face would be brought into relief by the burning match and a trail of sparks would light up the succeeding darkness Once his mule shied violently and we heard the angry rattling of a side winder a sound which once heard is never forgotten At about eight o clock what with rocks and kangaroo rat burrows the going became so bad that we decided to offsaddle and wait till the moon should rise We stretched out with our heads on our saddles and dozed until about midnight when it was time to start on again Soon the desert changed and we were free of the hills among which we had been travelling and were riding over endless rolling dunes of white sand As dawn broke the twin peaks of Pinacate appeared ahead of us and the sand gave place to a waste of red and black lava broken by steep arroyos We had been hearing coyotes during the night and now a couple jumped up from some rocks a hundred yards away and made off amongst the lava By eight o clock the sun was fiercely hot but we were in among the foot hills of Pinacate I asked Casares where the tanks were and he seemed rather vague but said they were beyond the next hills They were not but several times more he felt sure they were just around the next hill I realized that we were lost and resolved to give him one more try and then if I found that he was totally at sea as to the whereabouts of the tank I intended to find some shelter for the heat of the day and when it got cooler to throw the packs off our animals and strike back to Tule It is difficult to realize how quickly that fierce sun dries up man and beast I doubt if in that country a really good walker could have covered ten miles in the noonday heat without water and without stopping We could have made Tule all right but the return trip would have been a very unpleasant one and we would probably have lost some of our animals However just before we reached Casares s last location of the Papago tanks we came upon an unknown water hole in the bed of an arroyo The rains there are very local and although the rest of the country was as dry as tinder some fairly recent downpour had filled up this little rocky basin There were two trees near it a mesquite and a palo verde and though neither would fit exactly into the category of shade trees we were most grateful to them for being there at all The palo verde is very deceptive When seen from a distance its greenness gives it a false air of being a lovely restful screen from the sun but when one tries to avail oneself of its shade the fallacy is soon evident It is only when there is some parasitical mistletoe growing on it that the palo verde offers any real shade The horses were very thirsty and it was a revelation to see how they lowered the water in the pool Dominguez was only about thirty years old but he seemed jaded and tired whereas Casares who was white haired and must have been at least sixty was as fresh as ever Two days later when I was off hunting on the mountains Casares succeeded in finding the Papago tanks they were about fifteen miles to our northwest and were as dry as a bone I later learned that a Mexican had come through this country some three weeks before we were in there He had a number of pack animals When he found the Papago dry he struck on for the next water and succeeded in making it only after abandoning his packs and losing most of his horses We sat under our two trees during the heat of the day but shortly after four I took my rifle and my canteen and went off to look for sheep leaving the two Mexicans in camp Although I saw no rams I found plenty of sign and got a good idea of the lay of the land Illustration Casares on his white mule The next four or five days I spent hunting from this camp I was very anxious to get some antelope and I spent three or four days in a fruitless search for them It was I believe unusually dry even for that country and the antelope had migrated to better feeding grounds Aside from a herd of nine which I saw from a long way off but failed to come up with not only did I not see any antelope but I did not even find any fresh tracks There were many very old tracks and I have no doubt that at certain times of the year there are great numbers of antelope in the country over which I was hunting The long rides however were full of interest I took the Mexicans on alternate days and we always left camp before daylight As the hours wore on the sun would grow hotter and hotter In the middle of the day there was generally a breeze blowing across the lava beds and that breeze was like the blast from a furnace There are few whom the desert at sunset and sunrise fails to fascinate but only those who have the love of the wastes born in them feel the magic of their appeal under the scorching noonday sun Reptile life was abundant lizards scuttled away in every direction there were some rather large ones that held their tails up at an oblique angle above the ground as they ran which gave them a ludicrous appearance A species of toad whose back was speckled with red was rather common Jack rabbits and cottontails were fairly numerous and among the birds Gambel s quail and the whitewings or sonora pigeons were most in evidence I came upon one of these later on her nest in a palo verde tree the eggs were about the size of a robin s and were white and the nest was made chiefly of galleta grass The whitewings are very fond of the fruit of the saguaro this fruit is of a reddish orange color when ripe and the birds peck a hole in it and eat the scarlet pulp within It is delicious and the Indians collect it and dry it the season was over when I was in the country but there was some late fruit on a few of the trees When I was back in camp at sunset it was pleasant to hear the pigeons trilling as they flew down to the pool to drink One day we returned to the camp at about two I was rather hot and tired so I made a cup of tea and sat under the trees and smoked my pipe until almost four Then I picked up my rifle and went out by myself to look for sheep I climbed to the top of a great crater hill and sat down to look around with my field glasses Hearing a stone move behind I turned very slowly around About a hundred and fifty yards off on the rim of the crater stood six sheep two of them fine rams Very slowly I put down the field glasses and raised my rifle and I killed the finer of the rams It was getting dark so without bestowing more than a passing look upon him I struck off for camp at a round pace Now the Mexicans although good enough in the saddle were no walkers and so Dominguez saddled a horse put a pack saddle on a mule and followed me back to where the sheep lay We left the animals at the foot of the hill and although it was not a particularly hard climb up to the sheep the Mexican was blown and weary by the time we reached it The ram was a good one His horns measured sixteen and three fourths inches around the base and were thirty five inches long so they were larger in circumference though shorter than my first specimen He was very thin however and his hair was falling out so that one could pull it out in handfuls All the sheep that I saw in this country seemed thin and in poor shape while those near Tinah alta were in very fair condition The extreme dryness and scarcity of grass doubtless in part accounted for this although the country in which I got my first two sheep was in no sense green Making our way back to camp through the lava fields and across the numerous gullies was a difficult task The horses got along much better than I should have supposed indeed they didn t seem to find as much difficulty as I did Dominguez muttered that if the road past Tule was the Camino del Diablo this certainly was the Camino del Infierno When we reached camp my clothes were as wet as if I had been in swimming I set right to work on the headskin but it was eleven o clock before I had finished it that meant but four hours sleep for me and I felt somewhat melancholy about it Indeed on this trip the thing that I chiefly felt was the need of sleep for it was always necessary to make a very early start and it was generally after sunset before I got back to camp The Mexicans spoke about as much English as I spoke Spanish which was very little and as they showed no signs of learning I set to work to learn some Spanish At first our conversation was very limited but I soon got so that I could understand them pretty well We occasionally tried to tell each other stories but became so confused that we would have to call it off Dominguez had one English expression which he would pronounce with great pride and emphasis on all appropriate or inappropriate occasions it was You betcher Once he and I had some discussion as to what day it was and I appealed to Casares Ah quien sabe quien sabe who knows who knows was his reply he said that he never knew what day it was and got on very comfortably without knowing a point of view which gave one quite a restful feeling They christened our water hole Tinaja del B vora which means the tank of the rattlesnake They so named it because of the advent in camp one night of a rattler It escaped and got in a small lava cave from out of which the men tried long and unsuccessfully to smoke it At the place where we were camped our arroyo had tunnelled its way along the side of a hill so that from its bed one bank was about ten feet high and the other nearer fifty In the rocky wall of this latter side there were many caves One in particular would have furnished good sleeping quarters for wet weather It was about twenty five feet long and fifteen feet deep and it varied in height from four to six feet The signs showed that for generations it had been a favorite abode of sheep coyotes had also lived in it and in the back there was a big pack rat s nest Pieces of the bisnaga cactus with long cruel spikes formed a prominent part of the nest After I had hunted for antelope in every direction from camp and within as large a radius as I could manage I was forced to admit the hopelessness of the task The water supply was getting low but I determined to put in another good long day with the sheep before turning back Accordingly early one morning I left the two Mexicans in camp to rest and set off for the mountains on foot I headed for the main peak of Pinacate It was not long before I got in among the foot hills I kept down along the ravines for it was very early and as a rule the sheep didn t begin to go up the hills from their night s feeding until nine or ten o clock at this place also they almost always spent the noon hours in caves There were many little chipmunks running along with their tails arched forward over their backs which gave them rather a comical look At length I saw a sheep he was well up the side of a large hill an old crater as were many of these mountains I made off after him and found there were steep ravines to be reckoned with before I even reached the base of the hill The sides of the crater were covered with choyas and the footing on the loose lava was so uncertain that I said to myself I wonder how long it will be before you fall into one of these choyas and only a few minutes later I was gingerly picking choya burrs off my arms which had come off worst in the fall The points of the spikes are barbed and are by no means easy to pull out I stopped many times to wait for my courage to rise sufficiently to start to work again and by the time I had got myself free I was so angry that I felt like devoting the rest of my day to waging a war of retaliation upon the cactus The pain from the places from which I had pulled out the spikes lasted for about half an hour after I was free of them and later at Yuma I had to have some of the spines that I had broken off in my flesh cut out An hour or so later I came across a very fine bisnaga or niggerhead cactus I was feeling very thirsty and wishing to save my canteen as long as possible I decided to cut the bisnaga open and eat some of its pulp for this cactus always contains a good supply of sweetish water As I was busy trying to remove the long spikes I heard a rock fall and looking round saw a sheep walking along the opposite side of the gully and not more than four hundred yards away He was travelling slowly and had not seen me so I hastily made for a little ridge toward which he was heading I reached some rocks near the top of the ridge in safety and crouched behind them I soon saw that he was only a two year old and when he was two hundred yards off I stood up to have a good look at him When he saw me instead of immediately making off he stood and gazed at me I slowly sat down and his curiosity quite overcame him He proceeded to stalk me in a most scientific manner taking due advantage of choyas and rocks and cautiously poking his head out from behind them to stare at me He finally got to within fifty feet of me but suddenly and for no apparent reason he took fright and made off He did not go far and from a distance of perhaps five hundred yards watched me as I resumed operations on the cactus Not long after this as I was standing on the top of a hill I made out two sheep half hidden in a draw There was a great difference in the size of their horns and in the hasty glance I got of them one seemed to me to be big enough to warrant shooting I did not discover my mistake until I had brought down my game He was but a two year old and although I should have been glad of a good specimen for the museum his hide was in such poor condition that it was quite useless However I took his head and some meat and headed back for camp My camera water bottle and field glasses were already slung over my shoulder and the three hours tramp back to camp in the very hottest part of the day was tiring and I didn t feel safe in finishing my canteen until I could see camp Illustration Making fast the sheep s head The next day we collected as much galleta grass as we could for the horses and having watered them well an operation which practically finished our pool we set out for Tule at a little after three As soon as the Mexicans got a little saddle stiff they would stand up in one stirrup crooking the other knee over the saddle and keeping the free heel busy at the horses ribs The result was twofold the first and most obvious being a sore back for the horses and the second being that the horses became so accustomed to a continual tattoo to encourage them to improve their pace that with a rider unaccustomed to that method they lagged most annoyingly The ride back to Tule was as uneventful as it was lovely On the next day s march from Tule toward Win s tank I saw the only Gila monster the sluggish poisonous lizard of the southwestern deserts that I came across throughout the trip He was crossing the trail in leisurely fashion and darted his tongue out angrily as I stopped to admire him Utting told me of an interesting encounter he once saw between a Gila monster and a rattlesnake He put the two in a large box they were in opposite corners but presently the Gila monster started slowly and sedately toward the rattler s side of the box He paid absolutely no attention to the snake who coiled himself up and rattled angrily When the lizard got near enough the rattler struck out two or three times each time burying his fangs in the Gila monster s body the latter showed not the slightest concern and though Utting waited expectantly for him to die he apparently suffered no ill effects whatever from the encounter He showed neither anger nor pain he simply did not worry himself about the rattler at all We reached Wellton at about nine in the evening of the second day from Pinacate We had eaten all our food and our pack animals were practically without loads so we had made ninety miles in about fifty five hours Dominguez had suffered from the heat on the way back and at Win s tank which was inaccessible to the horses I had been obliged myself to pack all the water out to the animals At Wellton I parted company with the Mexicans with the regret one always feels at leaving the comrades of a hunting trip that has proved both interesting and successful IV After Moose in New Brunswick IV AFTER MOOSE IN NEW BRUNSWICK It was early in September when the four of us Clarke Jamieson Thompson and myself landed at Bathurst on Chaleur Bay and took the little railroad which runs twenty miles up the Nepisiquit River to some iron mines From that point we expected to pole up the river about forty miles farther and then begin our hunting For the four hunters sports was what the guides called us there were six guides Three of them bore the name Venneau there were Bill Grey and his son Willie and the sixth was Wirre pronounced Warry Chamberlain Among themselves the guides spoke French or a corruption of French which was hard to understand and which has come down from generation to generation without ever getting into written form A fine looking six they were straight with the Indian showing in their faces At the end of the third day of poling a lazy time for the sports but three days of marvellously skilful work for the guides our heavily laden canoes were brought up to the main camp From here we expected to start our hunting expeditions each taking a guide blankets and food and striking off for the more isolated cabins in the woods My purpose was to collect specimens for the National Museum at Washington I wanted moose caribou and beaver a male and female of each species Whole skins and leg bones were to be brought out A hard rain woke us and the prospects were far from cheerful as we packed and prepared to separate Bill Grey was to be my guide and the Popple Cabin three miles away was to be our shelter Our tramp through the wet woods pine hemlock birch and poplar ended at the little double lean to shelter After we had started a fire and spread our blankets to dry we set off in search of game We climbed out of the valley in which we were camped and up to the top of a hill from which we could get a good view of some small barren stretches that lay around us It was the blueberry season and these barrens were covered with bushes all heavily laden We moved around from hill to hill in search of game but saw only three deer We d have shot one of them for meat but didn t care to run the chance of frightening away any moose or caribou The last hill we climbed overlooked a small pond which lay beside a pine forest on the edge of a barren strip Bill intended to spend a good part of each day watching this pond and it was to a small hill overlooking it that we made our way early next morning Before we had been watching many minutes a cow moose with a calf appeared at the edge of the woods She hesitated for several minutes listening intently and watching sharply and then stepped out across the barren on her way to the pond Before she had gone far the path she was following cut the trail we had made on our way to the lookout hill She stopped immediately and began to sniff at our tracks the calf following her example a few seconds were enough to convince her but for some reason perhaps to make doubly sure she turned and for some minutes followed along our trail with her nose close to the ground Then she swung round and struck off into the woods at a great slashing moose trot Not long after she had disappeared we got a fleeting glimpse of two caribou cows they lacked the impressive ungainliness of the moose and in the distance might easily have been mistaken for deer It was a very cold morning and throughout the day it snowed and sleeted at intervals We spent the time wandering from hill to hill For the next week we hunted industriously in every direction from the Popple Cabin In the morning and the evening we shifted from hill to hill the middle of the day we hunted along the numerous brooks that furrowed the country With the exception of one or two days the weather was uniformly cold and rainy but after our first warm sunny day we welcomed rain and cold for then at least we had no black flies to fight On the two sunny days they surrounded us in swarms and made life almost unbearable they got into our blankets and kept us from sleeping during the nights they covered us with lumps and sores Bill said that he had never seen them as bad Illustration A noonday halt on the way down river returning from the hunting country It was lovely in the early morning to stand on some high hill and watch the mist rising lazily from the valley it was even more lovely to watch the approach of a rain storm The sunlight on some distant hillside or valley would suddenly be blotted out by a sheet of rain a few minutes later the next valley would be darkened as the storm swept toward us and perhaps before it reached us we could see the farther valleys over which it had passed lightening again We managed to cover a great deal of ground during that week and were rewarded by seeing a fair amount of game four caribou of which one was a bull a bull and three cow moose and six does and one buck deer I had but one shot and that was at a buck deer We wanted meat very much and Bill said that he didn t think one shot would disturb the moose and caribou He was a very large buck in prime condition I never tasted better venison Had our luck been a little better I would have had a shot at a moose and a caribou we saw the latter from some distance and made a long and successful stalk until Wirre on his way from the main camp with some fresh supplies frightened our quarry away On these trips between camps Wirre several times saw moose and caribou within range After a week we all foregathered at the main camp Clarke had shot a fine bear and Jamieson brought in a good moose head They started down river with their trophies and Thompson and I set out for new hunting grounds As Bill had gone with Jamieson I took his son Willie a sturdy pony built fellow of just my age We crossed the river and camped some two miles beyond it and about a mile from the lake we intended to hunt We put up a lean to and in front of it built a great fire of old pine logs for the nights were cold My blankets were warm and it was only after a great deal of wavering hesitation that I could pluck up courage to roll out of them in the penetrating cold of early morning On the second morning as we made our way through dew soaked underbrush to the lake we came out upon a little glade at the farther end of which stood a caribou He sprang away as he saw us but halted behind a bush to reconnoitre the victim of a fatal curiosity for it gave me my opportunity and I brought him down Although he was large in body he had a very poor head I spent a busy morning preparing the skin but in the afternoon we were again at the lake watching for moose We spent several fruitless days there One afternoon a yearling bull moose appeared he had apparently lost his mother for he wandered aimlessly around for several hours bewailing his fate This watching would have been pleasant enough as a rest cure but since I was hunting and very anxious to get my game it became a rather irksome affair However I could only follow Saint Augustine s advice when in Rome fast on Saturdays and I resigned myself to adopting Willie s plan of waiting for the game to come to us instead of pursuing my own inclination and setting out to find the game Luckily I had some books with me and passed the days pleasantly enough reading Voltaire and Boileau There was a beaver house at one end of the lake and between four and five the beaver would come out and swim around I missed a shot at one Red squirrels were very plentiful and would chatter excitedly at us from a distance of a few feet There was one particularly persistent little chap who did everything in his power to attract attention He would sit in the conventional squirrel attitude upon a branch and chirp loudly bouncing stiffly forward at each chirp precisely as if he were an automaton When we decided that it was useless to hunt this lake any longer we went back to the river to put in a few days hunting up and down it I got back to the camp in the evening and found Thompson there He had had no luck and intended to leave for the settlement in the morning Accordingly the next day he started downstream and we went up We hadn t been gone long before we heard what we took to be two shots though for all we knew they might have been a beaver striking the water with his tail That night when we got back to camp we found that on going round a bend in the river about a mile below camp Thompson had come upon a bull and a cow moose and had bagged the bull The next morning it was raining as if it were the first storm after a long drought and as we felt sure that no sensible moose would wander around much amid such a frozen downpour we determined to put in a day after beaver In one of my long tramps with Bill we had come across a large beaver pond and at the time Bill had remarked how easy it would be to break the dam and shoot the beaver I had carefully noted the location of this pond so managed successfully to pilot Willie to it and we set to work to let the water out This breaking the dam was not the easy matter I had imagined It was a big pond and the dam that was stretched across its lower end was from eight to ten feet high To look at its solid structure and the size of the logs that formed it it seemed inconceivable that an animal the size of a beaver could have built it The water was above our heads and there was a crust of ice around the edges We had to get in and work waist deep in the water to enlarge our break in the dam and the very remembrance of that cold morning s work trying to pry out logs with frozen fingers makes me shiver It was even worse when we had to stop work and wait and watch for the beavers to come out They finally did and I shot two They were fine large specimens the male was just two inches less than four feet and the female only one inch shorter Shivering and frozen we headed back for camp My hunting costume had caused a good deal of comment among the guides it consisted of a sleeveless cotton undershirt a many pocketed coat a pair of short khaki trousers reaching to just above my knees and then a pair of sneakers or of high boots I used the former when I wished to walk quietly My knees were always bare and were quite as impervious to cold as my hands but the guides could never understand why I didn t freeze I used to hear them solemnly discussing it in their broken French I had at first hoped to get my moose by fair stalking without the help of calling but I had long since abandoned that hope and Willie who was an excellent caller had been doing his best but with no result We saw several cow moose and once Willie called out a young bull but his horns could not have had a spread of more than thirty five inches and he would have been quite useless as a museum specimen Another time when we were crawling up to a lake not far from the river we found ourselves face to face with a two year old bull He was very close to us but as he hadn t got our wind he was merely curious to find out what we were for Willie kept grunting through his birch bark horn Once he came up to within twenty feet of us and stood gazing Finally he got our wind and crashed off through the lakeside alders As a rule moose answer a call better at night and almost every night we could hear them calling around our camp generally they were cows that we heard and once Willie had a duel with a cow as to which should have a young bull that we could hear in an alder thicket smashing the bushes with his horns Willie finally triumphed and the bull headed toward us with a most disconcerting rush next morning we found his tracks at the edge of the clearing not more than twenty yards from where we had been standing at that point the camp smoke and smells had proved more convincing than Willie s calling horn Late one afternoon I had a good opportunity to watch some beaver at work We had crawled cautiously up to a small lake in the vain hope of finding a moose when we came upon some beaver close to the shore Their house was twenty or thirty yards away and they were bringing out a supply of wood chiefly poplar for winter food To and fro they swam pushing the wood in front of them Occasionally one would feel hungry and then he would stop and start eating the bark from the log he was pushing It made me shiver to watch them lying lazily in that icy water I had already stayed longer than I intended and the day was rapidly approaching when I should have to start down river Even the cheerful Willie was getting discouraged and instead of accounts of the miraculous bags hunters made at the end of their trips I began to be told of people who were unfortunate enough to go out without anything I made up my mind to put in the last few days hunting from the Popple Cabin so one rainy noon after a morning s hunt along the river we shouldered our packs and tramped off to the little cabin from which Bill and I had hunted Wirre was with us and we left him to dry out the cabin while we went off to try a late afternoon s hunt As we were climbing the hill from which Bill and I used to watch the little pond Willie caught sight of a moose on the side of a hill a mile away One look through our field glasses convinced us it was a good bull A deep wooded valley intervened and down into it we started at headlong speed and up the other side we panted As we neared where we believed the moose to be I slowed down in order to get my wind in case I had to do some quick shooting I soon picked up the moose and managed to signal Willie to stop The moose was walking along at the edge of the woods somewhat over two hundred yards to our left The wind was favorable so I decided to try to get nearer before shooting It was a mistake for which I came close to paying dearly suddenly and without any warning the great animal swung into the woods and disappeared before I could get ready to shoot Willie had his birch bark horn with him and he tried calling but instead of coming toward us we could hear the moose moving off in the other direction The woods were dense and all chance seemed to have gone With a really good tracker such as are to be found among some of the African tribes the task would have been quite simple but neither Willie nor I was good enough We had given up hope when we heard the moose grunt on the hillside above us Hurrying toward the sound we soon came into more open country I saw him in a little glade to our right he looked most impressive as he stood there nearly nineteen hands at the withers shaking his antlers and staring at us I dropped to my knee and shot and that was the first that Willie knew of our quarry s presence He didn t go far after my first shot but several more were necessary before he fell We hurried up to examine him he was not yet dead and when we were half a dozen yards away he staggered to his feet and started for us but he fell before he could reach us Had I shot him the first day I might have had some compunction at having put an end to such a huge handsome animal but as it was I had no such feelings We had hunted long and hard and luck had been consistently against us Our chase had led us back in a quartering direction toward camp which was now not more than a mile away so Willie went to get Wirre while I set to work to take the measurements and start on the skinning Taking off a whole moose hide is no light task and it was well after dark before we got it off We estimated the weight of the green hide as well over a hundred and fifty pounds but probably less than two hundred We bundled it up as well as we could in some pack straps and as I seemed best suited to the task I fastened it on my back The sun had gone down and that mile back to camp crawling over dead falls and tripping on stones was one of the longest I have ever walked The final descent down the almost perpendicular hillside was the worst When I fell the skin was so heavy and such a clumsy affair that I couldn t get up alone unless I could find a tree to help me but generally Willie would start me off again When I reached the cabin in spite of the cold night air my clothes were as wet as if I had been in swimming After they had taken the skin off my shoulders I felt as if I had nothing to hold me down to earth and might at any moment go soaring into the air Next morning I packed the skin down to the main camp about three miles but I found it a much easier task in the daylight After working for a while on the skin I set off to look for a cow moose but as is always the case where they had abounded before there was none to be found now that we wanted one The next day we spent tramping over the barren hillsides after caribou Willie caught a glimpse of one but it disappeared into a pine forest before we could come up with it On the way back to camp I shot a deer for meat on our way down the river I had determined to have one more try for a cow moose and next morning was just going off to hunt some lakes when we caught sight of an old cow standing on the opposite bank of the river about half a mile above us We crossed and hurried up along the bank but when we reached the bog where she had been standing she had disappeared There was a lake not far from the river bank and we thought that she might have gone to it for we felt sure we had not frightened her As we reached the lake we saw her standing at the edge of the woods on the other side half hidden in the trees I fired and missed but as she turned to make off I broke her hind quarter After going a little distance she circled back to the lake and went out to stand in the water We portaged a canoe from the river and took some pictures before finishing the cow At the point where she fell the banks of the lake were so steep that we had to give up the attempt to haul the carcass out I therefore set to work to get the skin off where the cow lay in the water It was a slow cold task but finally I finished and we set off downstream Wirre in one canoe and Willie and myself in the other According to custom the moose head was laid in the bow of our canoe with the horns curving out on either side Illustration Bringing out the trophies of the hunt We had been in the woods for almost a month and in that time we had seen the glorious changes from summer to fall and fall to early winter for the trees were leafless and bare Robinson s lines kept running through my head as we sped downstream through the frosty autumn day Come away come away there s a frost along the marshes And a frozen wind that skims the shoal where it shakes the dead black water There s a moan across the lowland and a wailing through the woodland Of a dirge that sings to send us back to the arms of those that love us There is nothing left but ashes now where the crimson chills of autumn Put off the summer s languor with a touch that made us glad For the glory that is gone from us with a flight we cannot follow To the slopes of other valleys and the sounds of other shores V Two Book Hunters in South America V TWO BOOK HUNTERS IN SOUTH AMERICA In Collaboration with Mrs Kermit Roosevelt The true bibliophile will always find time to exercise his calling no matter where he happens to be or in what manner he is engaged in making his daily bread In some South American cities more particularly in Buenos Ayres there is so little to do outside of one s office that were there more old bookstores it would be what Eugene Field would have called a bibliomaniac s paradise To us wanderers on the face of the earth serendipity in its more direct application to book collecting is a most satisfactory pursuit for it requires but little capital and in our annual flittings to somewhere else our purchases necessitate but the minimum of travelling space There are two classes of bibliophiles those to whom the financial side is of little or no consequence and those who like the clerk of the East India House must count their pennies and save and go without other things to counterbalance an extravagance in the purchase of a coveted edition To the former class these notes may seem overworldly in their frequent allusion to prices but to its authors the financial side must assume its relative importance Among the South American republics Brazil undeniably takes precedence from a literary standpoint Most Brazilians from Lauro Muller the minister of foreign affairs to the postmaster of the little frontier town have at some period in their lives published or at all events written a volume of prose or verse It comes to them from their natural surroundings and by inheritance for once you except Cervantes the Portuguese have a greater literature than the Spaniards There is therefore in Brazil an excellent and widely read native literature and in almost every home there are to be found the works of such poets as Gon alves Diaz and Castro Alves and historians novelists and essayists like Taunay Couto de Magalh ens Alencar and Coelho Netto Taunay s most famous novel Innocencia a tale of life in the frontier state of Matto Grosso the great wilderness has been translated into seven languages including the Japanese and Polish The literature of the mother country is also generally known Cam es is read in the schools and a quotation from the Lusiads is readily capped by a casual acquaintance in the remotest wilderness town Portuguese poets and playwrights like Almeda Garret Bocage Quental and Guerra Junquera and historians and novelists such as Herculano E a de Queiroz or Castello Branco are widely read In Brazil as throughout South America French is almost universally read cheap editions of the classics are found in most homes and bookstores are filled with modern French writers of prose or verse sometimes in translation and as frequently in the original Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo abound in old bookstores which are to be found in fewer numbers in others of the larger towns such as Manaos Para Pernambuco Bahia Curytiba or Porto Alegre In the smaller towns of the interior one runs across only new books although occasionally those who possess the flaire may chance upon some battered treasure The line which is of most interest and in South America presents the greatest latitude is undoubtedly that of early voyages and discoveries Probably it was because they were in a greater or less degree voyagers or explorers themselves that the Americans and English who came to South America seventy or eighty years ago brought with them books of exploration and travel both contemporary and ancient Many of these volumes now rare in the mother country are to be picked up for a song in the old bookstores of the New World The accounts of the Conquistadores and early explorers now in the main inaccessible except in great private collections or museums have frequently been reprinted and if written in a foreign tongue translated in the country which they describe Thus the account of P re Yveux was translated and printed in Maranh o in and this translation is now itself rare We picked up a copy for fifty cents in a junk store in Bahia but in S o Paulo had to pay the market price for the less rare translation of Hans Stade s captivity Ulrich Schmidel s entertaining account of the twenty years of his life spent in the first half of the sixteenth century in what is now Argentina Paraguay and Brazil has been excellently translated into Spanish by an Argentine of French descent Lafoyne Quevedo the head of the La Plata museum We had never seen the book until one day at the judicial auction held by the heirs of a prominent Argentine lawyer Books published in Buenos Ayres are as a whole abominably printed but this was really beautiful so we determined to get it The books were being sold in ill assorted lots and this one was with three other volumes one was an odd volume of Italian poetry one a religious treatise and the third a medical book Bidding had been low and save for standard legal books the lots had been going at two or three dollars apiece Our lot quickly went to five dollars There was soon only one man bidding against us We could not understand what he wanted but thought that perhaps the Schmidel was worth more than we had imagined Our blood was up and we began trying to frighten our opponent by substantial raises at fourteen he dropped out The dealers in common with every one else were much intrigued at the high bidding and clearly felt that something had escaped them The mystery was solved when our opponent hurried over to ask what we wanted for the odd volume of Italian verse it belonged to him and he had loaned it to the defunct lawyer shortly before his death We halved the expenses and the lot and as a curious sequel later found that the medical book which had quite accidentally fallen to our share was worth between fifteen and twenty dollars Prices in Brazil seemed very high in comparison with those of Portugal and Spain but low when compared with Argentina On the west coast we found books slightly less expensive than in Brazil where however the prices have remained the same as before the war though the drop in exchange has given the foreigner the benefit of a twenty five per cent reduction There are a fair number of auctions and old books are also sold through priced lists published in the daily papers We obtained our best results by search in the bookshops It was in this way that we got for three dollars the first edition of Castelleux s Voyage dans la Partie Septentrionale de l Amerique in perfect condition and for one dollar Jordan s Guerra do Paraguay for which a bookseller in Buenos Ayres had asked as a tremendous bargain twelve dollars In S o Paulo after much searching we found Santos Saraiva s paraphrase of the Psalms a famous translation quite as beautiful as our own English version The translator was born in Lisbon His father was a Jewish rabbi but he entered the Catholic Church became a priest and went to an inland parish in southern Brazil After some years he left the Church and settled down with a Brazilian woman in a small out of the way fazenda where he translated the Psalms and also composed a Greek lexicon that is regarded as a masterpiece He later became instructor in Greek in Mackenzie College in S o Paulo confining his versatile powers to that institution until he died The dearth of native literature in Buenos Ayres is not surprising for nature has done little to stimulate it and in its fertility much to create the commercialism that reigns supreme The country is in large part rolling prairie land and although there is an attraction about it in its wild state which has called forth a gaucho literature that chiefly takes form in long and crude ballads the magic of the prairie land is soon destroyed by houses factories dump heaps and tin cans At first sight it would appear hopeless ground for a bibliophile but with time and patience we found a fair number of old bookstores and there rarely passes a week without a book auction or at any rate an auction where some books are put up Among the pleasantest memories of our life in Buenos Ayres are those of motoring in to a sale from our house in Belgrano along the famous Avenida Alvear on starlit nights with the Southern Cross high and brilliant Occasionally when the books we were interested in were far between we would slip out of the smoke laden room for a cup of unrivalled coffee at the Caf Paulista or to watch Charlie Chaplin as Carlitos amuse the Argentine public The great percentage of the books one sees at auctions or in bookstores are strictly utilitarian generally either on law or medicine In the old bookstores there are as in Boston rows of religious books on which the dust lies undisturbed In Argentine literature there are two or three famous novels most famous of these is probably Marmol s Amalia a bloodthirsty and badly written story of the reign of Rosas the gaucho Nero Bunge s Novela de la Sangre is an excellently given but equally lurid account of the same period La Gloria de Don Ramiro by Rodriguez Larreta is a well written tale of the days of Philip the Second The author the present Argentine minister in Paris spent some two years in Spain studying the local setting of his romance Most Argentines if they have not read these novels at least know the general plots and the more important characters The literature of the mother country is little read and as a rule looked down upon by the Argentines who are more apt to read French or even English La Nacion which is one of the two great morning papers and owned by a son of Bartholom Mitre publishes a cheap uniform edition which is formed of some Argentine reprints and originals but chiefly of French and English translations The latest publication is advertised on the front page of the newspaper and one often runs across old friends whose new faces cause a momentary check to the memory such as La Feria de Vanidades the identity of which is clear when one reads that the author is Thackeray This Biblioteca de la Nacion is poorly got up and printed on wretched paper but seems fairly widely read and will doubtless stimulate the scarcely existent literary side of the Argentine and in due time bear fruit Translations of Nick Carter and the penny dreadfuls are rife but a native writer Gutierrez who wrote in the seventies and eighties created a national hero Juan Moreira who was a benevolent Billy the Kid Gutierrez wrote many dramas policiales which are well worth reading for the light they throw in their side touches on gaucho life of those days Argentines are justifiably proud of Bartholom Mitre their historian soldier who was twice president and of Sarmiento essayist and orator who was also president and who introduced the educational reforms whose application he had studied in the United States At an auction in New York we secured a presentation copy of his Vida de Lincoln written and published in this country in Mitre first published his history of General Belgrano of revolutionary fame in two volumes in It has run through many editions the much enlarged one in four volumes is probably more universally seen in private houses than any other Argentine book The first edition is now very rare and worth between forty and fifty dollars but in a cheap Italian stationery store we found a copy in excellent condition and paid for it only four dollars and fifty cents The edition of brings anywhere from twenty to thirty dollars Many copies were offered at sales but we delayed in hopes of a better bargain and one night our patience was rewarded It was at the fag end of a private auction of endless rooms of cheap and tawdry furniture that the voluble auctioneer at length reached the contents of the solitary bookcase Our coveted copy was knocked down to us at eight dollars In native houses one very rarely finds what we would even dignify by the name of library Generally a fair sized bookcase of ill assorted volumes is regarded as such There are however excellent legal and medical collections to be seen and Doctor Moreno s colonial quinta with its well filled shelves chiefly volumes of South American exploration and development from the earliest times forms a marked exception an oasis in the desert We once went to stay in the country with some Argentines who seeing us arrive with books in our hands proudly offered the use of their library to which we had often heard their friends make reference For some time we were greatly puzzled as to the location of this much talked of collection and were fairly staggered on having a medium sized bookcase half of which was taken up by a set of excerpts from the world s great thinkers and speakers in French pointed out as the library As a rule the first thing a family will part with is its books There are two sorts of auctions judicial and booksellers The latter class are held by dealers who are having bad times and hope to liquidate some of their stock but there are always cappers in the crowd who keep bidding until a book is as high and often higher than its market price The majority of the books are generally legal or medical and there is always a good number of young students who hope to get reference books cheaply Most of the books are in Spanish but there is a sprinkling of French and often a number of English German and Portuguese though these last are no more common in Argentina than are Spanish books in Brazil At one auction there were a number of Portuguese lots which went for far more than they would have brought in Rio or S o Paulo Translations from the Portuguese are infrequent the only ones we can recall were of Cam es and E a de Queiroz In Brazil the only translation from Spanish we met with was of Don Quixote English books generally go reasonably at auctions We got a copy of Page s Paraguay and the River Plate for twenty five cents but on another occasion had some very sharp bidding for Wilcox s History of Our Colony in the River Plate London written during the brief period when Buenos Ayres was an English possession It was finally knocked down to us at twelve dollars and after the auction our opponent offered us twice what he had let us have it for we don t yet know what it is worth The question of values is a difficult one for there is little or no data to go upon in consequence the element of chance is very considerable From several sources in the book world we heard a wild and most improbable tale of how Quaritch and several other London houses had many years ago sent a consignment of books to be auctioned in the Argentine and that the night of the auction was so cold and disagreeable that the exceedingly problematical buyers were still further reduced The auction was held in spite of conditions and rare incunabula are reported to have gone at a dollar apiece There was one judicial auction that lasted for the best part of a week the entire stock of a large bookstore that had failed They were mostly new books and such old ones as were of any interest were interspersed in lots of ten or more of no value The attendance was large and bidding was high To get the few books we wanted we had also to buy a lot of waste material but when we took this to a small and heretofore barren bookstore to exchange we found a first edition of the three first volumes of Kosmos for which with a number of Portuguese and Spanish books thrown in we made the exchange We searched long and without success for the fourth volume but as the volumes were published at long intervals it is probable that the former owner had only possessed the three Our best finds were made not at auctions but in bookstores often in little combination book cigar and stationery shops We happened upon one of these latter one Saturday noon on our way to lunch at a little Italian restaurant where you watched your chicken being most deliciously roasted on a spit before you Chickens were forgotten and during two hours breathless hunting we found many good things among them a battered old copy of Byron s poems which had long since lost its binding Pasted in it was the following original letter of Byron s which as far as we know has never before been published A MONSIEUR MONSIEUR GALIGNANI Rue Vivienne Paris SIR In various numbers of your journal I have seen mentioned a work entitled The Vampire with the addition of my name as that of the author I am not the author and never heard of the work in question until now In a more recent paper I perceive a formal annunciation of The Vampire with the addition of an account of my residence in the Island of Mitylane an island which I have occasionally sailed by in the course of travelling some years ago through the Levant and where I should have no objection to reside but where I have never yet resided Neither of these performances are mine and I presume that it is neither unjust nor ungracious to request that you will favour me by contradicting the advertisement to which I allude If the book is clever it would be base to deprive the real writer whoever he may be of his honours and if stupid I desire the responsibility of nobody s dulness but my own You will excuse the trouble I give you the imputation is of no great importance and as long as it was confined to surmises and reports I should have received it as I have received many others in silence But the formality of a public advertisement of a book I never wrote and a residence where I never resided is a little too much particularly as I have no notion of the contents of the one nor the incidents of the other I have besides a personal dislike to vampires and the little acquaintance I have with them would by no means induce me to divulge their secrets You did me a much less injury by your paragraphs about my devotion and abandonment of society for the sake of religion which appeared in your Messenger during last Lent all of which are not founded on fact but you see I do not contradict them because they are merely personal whereas the others in some degree concern the reader You will oblige me by complying with my request for contradiction I assure you that I know nothing of the work or works in question and have the honour to be as the correspondents to magazines say your constant reader and very obedt humble Servt BYRON To the editor of Galignani s Messenger Etc etc etc Venice April Curiously enough the book itself had been published by Galignani in The cost of our total purchases a goodly heap amounted to but five dollars The balance in quantity if not in quality in old books is held in Buenos Ayres by three brothers named Palumbo Italians The eldest is a surly old man who must be treated with severity from the very beginning How he manages to support himself we do not know for whenever we were in his store we were sure to hear him assail some customer most abusively In a small subsidiary store of his among a heap of old pamphlets we came upon the original folios of Humboldt s account of the fauna and flora of South America Upon asking the price the man said thirty five apiece we thought he meant pesos and our surprise was genuine when we found he meant centavos about fifteen cents From him we got the first edition of Kendall s Santa F Expedition One of his brothers was very pleasant and probably in consequence the most prosperous of the three The third was reputed crazy and certainly acted so but after an initial encounter we became friends and got on famously All three had a very fair idea of the value of Argentine books but knew little or nothing about English Another dealer who has probably a better stock than any of the Palumbos is a man named Real y Taylor His grandmother was English and his father spent his life dealing in books At his death the store was closed and the son started speculating in land with the money his father had left him Prices soared and he bought but when the crash came he was caught with many others Bethinking himself of his father s books he took them out of storage and opened a small booth The stock was large and a good part of it has not yet been unpacked Taylor has only a superficial knowledge of what he deals in He shears folios strips off original boards and old leathers to bind in new pasteboard and raises the price five or ten dollars after the process In this he is no different from the rest for after a fairly comprehensive experience in Buenos Ayres we may give it as our opinion that there is not a single dealer who knows the rules as they are observed by scores of dealers in America and England Taylor had only one idea and that was that if any one were interested in a book that book must be of great value he would name a ridiculous price and it was a question of weeks and months before he would reduce it to anything within the bounds of reason We never really got very much from him the best things being several old French books of early voyages to South America and a first edition of Anson s Voyage Around the World Just before we left he decided to auction off his stock putting up five hundred lots a month The first auction lasted three nights The catalogue was amusing giving a description of each book in bombastic fashion all were unique in interest and about every third was the only copy extant outside the museums He had put base prices on most and for the rest had arranged with cappers The attendance was very small and nearly everything was bid in It was curious to see how to the last he held that any book that any one was interested in must be of unusual worth There was put up a French translation of Azara s Quadrupeds of Paraguay The introduction was by Cuvier but it was not of great interest to us for a friend had given us the valuable original Spanish edition Taylor had asked fifteen dollars which we had regarded as out of the question he then took off the original binding cut and colored the pages and rebound it asking twenty dollars At the auction we thought we would get it if it went for very little but when we bid Taylor got up and told the auctioneer to say that as it was a work of unique value he had put as base price fifteen dollars each for the two volumes The auction was a failure and as it had been widely and expensively advertised the loss must have been considerable As a whole we found the booksellers of a disagreeable temperament In one case we almost came to blows luckily not until we had looked over the store thoroughly and bought all we really wanted among them a first edition of Howells s Italian Journeys in perfect condition for twenty five cents There were of course agreeable exceptions such as the old French Italian from whom after many months intermittent bargaining we bought Le Vaillant s Voyage en Afrique the first edition with most delightful steel engravings He at first told us he was selling it at a set price on commission which is what we found they often said when they thought you wanted a book and wished to preclude bargaining This old man had Amsterdam catalogues that he consulted in regard to prices when as could not have been often the case he found in them references to books he had in stock We know of no Argentine old bookstore that prints a catalogue In the larger provincial cities of Argentina we met with singularly little success In Cordoba the only reward of an eager search was a battered paper covered copy of All on the Irish Shore with which we were glad to renew an acquaintance that had lapsed for several years We had had such high hopes of Cordoba as being the old university town and early centre of learning There was indeed one trail that seemed to promise well and we diligently pursued vague stories of a viejo who had trunks of old books in every language but when we eventually found his rooms opening off a dirty little patio they were empty and bereft and we learned from a grimy brood of children that he had gone to the hospital in Buenos Ayres and died there and that his boxes had been taken away by they knew not whom As in Argentina the best known Chilian writers are historians or lawyers and in our book hunts in Santiago we encountered more or less the same conditions that held in Buenos Ayres shelf upon shelf of legal or medical reference books and technical treatises The works of certain well known historians such as Vicu a Mackenna and Amonategui consistently command relatively high prices but as a whole books are far cheaper on the west side of the Andes One long afternoon in the Calle San Diego stands out It was a rich find but we feel that the possibilities of that store are still unexhausted That afternoon s trove included the first edition of Mungo Park s Travels with the delightful original etchings a History of Guatemala written by the Dominican missionaries published in an old leather bound folio in excellent shape a first edition of Holmes s Autocrat of the Breakfast Table and three of the eight volumes of State Papers and Publick Documents of the United States In these last there was James Monroe s book plate and it was curious to imagine how these volumes from his library had found their way to a country where his doctrine has been the subject of such bitter discussion and so much misinterpretation The value of the original covers was no more understood in Chile than in Argentina and we got a complete set of Vicu a Mackenna s Campa a de Tacna in the original pamphlets as published for but half what was currently asked for bound and mutilated copies Valparaiso proved a barren field and although one of the chief delights in book hunting lies in the fact that you can never feel that you have completely exhausted the possibilities of a place we came nearer to feeling that way about Valparaiso than we ever had about a town before We found but one store that gave any promise and from it all we got were the first seven volumes of Dickens s Household Words in perfect condition and the Campaign of the Rapidan The little coast towns of Chile and Peru are almost as barren as the desert rocks and sand hills that surround them but even here we had occasional surprises as when we picked up for fifty cents at Antofogasta a desolate thriving little mining port in the north of Chile Vicu a Mackenna s Life of O Higgins for which the current price is from ten to fifteen dollars Another time in Coquimbo we saw a man passing along the street with a hammered copper bowl that we coveted and following we found him the owner of a junk shop filled with a heterogeneous collection of old clothes broken and battered furniture horse trappings and a hundred and one odds and ends among which were scattered some fifty or sixty books One of these was a first edition of Hawthorne s Twice Told Tales in the familiar old brown boards of Ticknor Company Our South American book hunting ended in Lima the entrancing old city of the kings once the capital of the New World and not yet robbed by this commercial age of all its glamour and backwardness We expected much knowing that when the Chilians occupied the city in they sacked the national library of fifty thousand volumes that their own liberator San Martin had founded in and although many of the books were carried off to Chile the greater part was scattered around Lima or sold by weight on the streets We shall always feel that with more time much patience and good luck we could have unearthed many treasures although at first sight the field is not a promising one and as elsewhere one s acquaintances assure one that there is nothing to be found In spite of this however we came upon a store that appeared teeming with possibilities Without the flaire or much luck it might be passed by many times without exciting interest Over the dingy grated window of a dilapidated colonial house is the legend Encuadernacion y Imprenta Binding and Printing Through the grimy window panes may be seen a row of dull law books but if you open the big gate and cross the patio with its ancient hand well in the centre on the opposite side are four or five rooms with shelves of books along the walls and tottering and fallen piles of books scattered over the floor Here we picked up among others an amusing little old vellum covered edition of Horace printed in England in which must have early found its way to South America to judge from the Spanish scrawls on the title page We also got many of the works of Ricardo Palma Peru s most famous writer who built up the ruined national library which now possesses some sixty thousand volumes of which a twelfth part were donated by our own Smithsonian Institution One of the volumes we bought had been given by Palma to a friend and had an autograph dedication which in other countries would have greatly enhanced its value but which curiously enough seems to make no difference in South America In Buenos Ayres we got a copy of the Letters from Europe of Campos Salles Brazil s greatest president which had been inscribed by him to the Argentine translator Once in S o Paulo we picked up an autographed copy of Gomes de Amorim and in neither case did the autograph enter into the question of determining the price We had heard rumors of possibilities in store for us in Ecuador Colombia and Venezuela but Lima was our farthest north for there our ramblings in South America were reluctantly brought to a close We feel however that such as they were and in spite of the fact that the names of many of the authors and places will be strange to our brethren who have confined their explorations to the northern hemisphere these notes may awaken interest in a little known field which if small in comparison with America or the Old World offers at times unsuspected prizes and rewards VI Seth Bullock Sheriff of the Black Hills Country VI SETH BULLOCK SHERIFF OF THE BLACK HILLS COUNTRY With the death of Captain Seth Bullock of Deadwood South Dakota there came to us who were his friends not only a deep sense of personal loss but also the realization that one of the very last of the old school of frontiersmen had gone one of those whom Lowell characterized as stern men with empires in their brains The hard hand of circumstance called forth and developed the type and for a number of generations the battle with the wilderness continued in bitter force and a race was brought forth trained to push on far beyond the edge of cultivation and contend in his remote fastnesses with the Red Indian and eke out a hard earned existence from the grim and resentful wilds In the wake of the vanguard came the settler and after him the merchant and busy towns sprang up where the lonely camp fire of the pioneer had flared to the silent forest The restless blood of the frontiers pressed ever onward the Indian melted away like snow upon the desert s dusty face the great herds of game that formerly blackened the plains left the mute testimony of their passing in the scattered piles of whitened skulls and bleached bones At last the time came when there was no further frontier to conquer The restless race of empire makers had staring them in the face the same fate as the Indian Their rough and ready justice administered out of hand had to give way before the judge with his court house and his jury The majority of the old Indian fighters were shouldered aside and left to end their days as best they could forgotten by those for whom they had won the country They could not adapt themselves to the new existence their day had passed and they went to join the Indian and the buffalo Illustration The Captain makes advances to a little Indian girl Captain Seth Bullock however belonged to the minority for no turn of the wheel could destroy his usefulness to the community and his large philosophy of the plains enabled him to fit into and hold his place through every shift of surroundings The Captain s family came from Virginia but he was born in Windsor Ontario in Before he was twenty he had found his way to Montana and built for himself a reputation for justice which at that day and in that community could only be established by cold and dauntless courage One of the feats of his early days of which he was justly proud was when he had himself hung the first man to be hung by law in Montana The crowd of prospectors and cow punchers did not approve of such an unusual unorthodox method of procedure as the hanging of a man by a public hangman after he had been duly tried and sentenced They wished to take the prisoner and string him up to the nearest tree or telegraph pole with the readiness and despatch to which they were accustomed To evidence their disapproval they started to shoot at the hangman he fled but before the crowd could secure their victim the Captain had the mastery of the situation and quieting his turbulent fellow citizens with a cold eye and relentless six shooter he himself performed the task that the hangman had left unfinished The incident inspired the mob with a salutary respect for the law and its ability to carry out its sentences I do not remember whether the Captain was mayor or sheriff at the time He was trusted and admired as well as feared and when he was barely twenty two he was elected State senator from Helena the largest town in the then territory of Montana It was in that the Captain first went to the Black Hills that lovely group of mountains in the southwestern corner of South Dakota He came with the first rush of prospectors when the famous Hidden Treasure Mine was discovered On the site of what is at present the town of Deadwood he set up a store for miners supplies and soon had established himself as the arm of the law in that very lawless community That was the Captain s r le all through his life In the early years he would spend day and night in the saddle in pursuit of rustlers and road agents When he once started on the trail nothing could make him relinquish it and when he reached the end his quarry would better surrender without drawing He had a long arm and his district was known throughout the West as an unhealthy place for bad men Starting as federal peace officer of the Black Hills he later became marshal and sheriff of the district and eventually marshal of South Dakota which position he held until As years passed and civilization advanced his bag of malefactors became less simple in character although maintaining some of the old elements In he wrote me I have been very busy lately pulled two horse thieves from Montana last week for stealing horses from the Pine Ridge Indians I leave to day for Leavenworth with a bank cashier for mulling a bank He may turn up on Wall Street when his term expires to take a post graduate course In he told me that he was going off among the Ute Indians and I asked him to get me some of their pipes He answered The Utes are not pipe makers they spend all their time rustling and eating government grub We had six horse thieves for the pen after the past term of court and should get four more at the June term in Pierre This will keep them quiet for a while I am now giving my attention to higher finance and have one of the Napoleons a bank president in jail here He only got away with he did not have time to become eligible for the Wall Street class It was when the Captain was sheriff of the Black Hills that father first met him A horse thief that was wanted in the Deadwood district managed to slip out of the Captain s clutches and was captured by father who was deputy sheriff in a country three or four hundred miles north A little while later father had to go to Deadwood on business Fording a river some miles out of town he ran into the Captain Father had often heard of Seth Bullock for his record and character were known far and wide and he had no difficulty in identifying the tall slim hawk featured Westerner sitting his horse like a centaur Seth Bullock however did not know so much about father and was very suspicious of the rough unkempt group just in from two weeks sleeping out in the gumbo and sage brush He made up his mind that it was a tin horn gambling outfit and would bear close watching He was not sure but what it would be best to turn them right back and let them walk around his district like it was a swamp After settling father s identity the Captain s suspicions vanished That was the beginning of their lifelong friendship After father had returned to the East to live Seth Bullock would come on to see him every so often and whenever my father s campaigning took him West the Captain would join the train and stay with him until the trip was finished These tours were rarely without incident and in his autobiography father has told of the part Seth Bullock played on one of them When in I was nominated for Vice President I was sent by the National Committee on a trip into the States of the high plains and the Rocky Mountains These had all gone overwhelmingly for Mr Bryan on the free silver issue four years previously and it was thought that I because of my knowledge of and acquaintanceship with the people might accomplish something toward bringing them back into line It was an interesting trip and the monotony usually attendant upon such a campaign of political speaking was diversified in vivid fashion by occasional hostile audiences One or two of the meetings ended in riots One meeting was finally broken up by a mob everybody fought so that the speaking had to stop Soon after this we reached another town where we were told there might be trouble Here the local committee included an old and valued friend a two gun man of repute who was not in the least quarrelsome but who always kept his word We marched round to the local opera house which was packed with a mass of men many of them rather rough looking My friend the two gun man sat immediately behind me a gun on each hip his arms folded looking at the audience fixing his gaze with instant intentness on any section of the house from which there came so much as a whisper The audience listened to me with rapt attention At the end with a pride in my rhetorical powers which proceeded from a misunderstanding of the situation I remarked to the chairman I held that audience well there wasn t an interruption To which the chairman replied Interruption Well I guess not Seth had sent round word that if any son of a gun peeped he d kill him Autobiography p Father had the greatest admiration and affection for the Captain It was to him that he was referring in his autobiography when he wrote I have sometimes been asked if Wister s Virginian is not overdrawn why one of the men I have mentioned in this chapter was in all essentials the Virginian in real life not only in his force but in his charm When we were hunting in Africa father decided that he would try to get Seth Bullock to meet us in Europe at the end of the trip I remember father describing him to some of our English friends in Khartoum and saying Seth Bullock is a true Westerner the finest type of frontiersman He could handle himself in any situation and if I felt that I did not wish him to meet any particular person the reflection would be entirely on the latter The Captain wrote me that he was afraid he could not meet us in London because of the illness of one of his daughters but matters eventually worked out in such a way that he was able to go over to England and when he met father there he said he felt like hanging his Stetson on the dome of Saint Paul s and shooting it off to show his exhilaration at the reunion He thoroughly enjoyed himself in England and while at bottom he was genuinely appreciative of the Britisher he could not help poking sly fun at him I remember riding on a bus with him and hearing him ask the conductor where this famous Picalilly Street was The conductor said You must mean Piccadilly sir The Captain entered into a lengthy conversation with him and with an unmoved stolidity of facial expression that no Red Indian could have bettered referred each time to Picalilly and each time the little bus conductor would interpose a You mean Piccadilly sir with the dogged persistency of his race The major domos and lackeys at the Guildhall and other receptions and the beefeaters at the Tower were a never failing source of delight he would try to picture them on a bad pony in the cow country and explain that their costume would make them the envy of every Sioux brave at an Indian dog dance When my sister and I were in Edinburgh the local guide who took us through the Castle showed us an ancient gun which instead of being merely double barrelled possessed a cluster of five or six barrels With great amusement he told us how an American to whom he had been showing the piece a few days previously had remarked that to be shot at with that gun must be like taking a shower bath A few questions served to justify the conclusion we had immediately formed as to identity of our predecessor The summer that I was fourteen father shipped me off to the Black Hills for a camping trip with Seth Bullock I had often seen him in the East so the tall spare figure and the black Stetson were familiar to me when the Captain boarded the train a few stations before reaching Deadwood Never shall I forget the romance of that first trip in the West It was all new to me Unfortunately I had to leave for the East for the start of school before the opening of the deer season but we caught a lot of trout and had some unsuccessful bear hunts hunts which were doomed to unsuccess before they started but which supplied the requisite thrill notwithstanding All we ever found of the bear was their tracks but we had a fleeting glimpse of a bobcat and that was felt amply to repay any amount of tramping Our bag consisted of one jack rabbit The Captain told us that we were qualified to join a French trapper whom he had known The Frenchman was caught by an unusually early winter and snowed in away off in the hills In the spring a good deal to every one s surprise he turned up looking somewhat thin but apparently totally unconcerned over his forced hibernation When asked what he had lived on he replied Some day I keel two jack rabeet one day one one day none The Captain and I took turns at writing my diary I find his entry for August Broke camp at Jack Boyden s on Sand Creek at A M and rode via Redwater Valley and Hay Creek to Belle Fourche arriving at the S B ranch at two o clock had lunch of cold cabbage visited the town returned to camp at five P M had supper at the wagon and fought mosquitoes until ten o clock Broke camp and rode via Owl Creek divide and Indian Creek through several very large towns inhabited chiefly by prairie dogs to our camp on Porcupine Creek Fought mosquitoes from A M to breakfast time I had long been an admirer of Bret Harte and many of the people I met might have stepped from the pages of his stories There was the old miner with twenty two children who couldn t remember all their names His first wife had presented him with ten of them but when he married again he had told his second wife that it was his initial venture in matrimony He gave a vivid description of the scene when some of the progeny of his first marriage unexpectedly put in an appearance Time had smoothed things over and the knowledge of her predecessor had evidently only acted as a spur to greater deeds as exemplified in the twelve additions to the family Then there was the old lady with the vinegar jug She was the postmistress of Buckhorn We had some difficulty in finding the post office but at length we learned that the postmistress had moved it fifteen miles away to cross the State border in order that she might live in Wyoming and have a vote We reached the shack to find it deserted but we had not long to wait before she rode in purple in the face and nearly rolling off her pony from laughter She told us that she had got some vinegar from a friend and while she was riding along the motion exploded the jug and the cork hit her in the head what with the noise and the blow she made sure the Indians were after her and rode for her life a couple of miles before she realized what had happened What could have surpassed the names of the trails along which we rode and the canyons in which we camped There was Hidden Treasure Gulch and Calamity Hollow and a score more equally satisfying That first trip was an immense success and all during the winter that followed whenever school life became particularly irksome I would turn to plans for the expedition that we had scheduled for the next summer When the time to leave for the West arrived I felt like an old stager and indulged for the first time in the delight of getting out my hunting outfit deciding what I needed and supplementing my last summer s rig with other things that I had found would be useful Like all beginners I imagined that I required a lot for which I had in reality no possible use Some men always set off festooned like Christmas trees and lose half the pleasure of the trip through trying to keep track of their belongings They have special candles patented lanterns enormous jack knives with a blade to fulfil every conceivable purpose rifles and revolvers and shotguns galore almost anything that comes under the classification of it might come in handy The more affluent hunter varies only in the quality and not the quantity of his gadjets He usually has each one neatly tucked away in a pigskin case The wise man however soon learns that although anything may come in handy once on a trip you could even on that occasion either get along without it or find a substitute that would do almost as well It is surprising with what a very little one can make out perfectly comfortably This was a lesson which I very quickly learned from the Captain The second trip that we took was from Deadwood South Dakota to Medora North Dakota I had never seen the country in which father ranched and Seth Bullock decided to take me up along the trail that father had been travelling when they met for the first time We set off on Friday the th and naturally everything that happened was charged up to that inauspicious day We lost all our horses the first night and only succeeded in retrieving a part of them Thereafter it started in raining and the gumbo mud became all but impassable for the chuck wagon The mosquitoes added to our misery and I find in my diary in the Captain s handwriting a note to the effect that Paul shot three mosquitoes with a six shooter Stanley missed with a shotgun The Captain was as stolid and unconcerned as a Red Indian through every change of weather He had nicknamed me Kim from Kipling s tale and after me he had named a large black horse which he always rode It was an excellent animal with a very rapid walk which proved the bane of my existence My pony Pickpocket had no pace that corresponded and to adapt himself was forced to travel at a most infernal jiggle that was not only exceedingly wearing but shook me round so that the rain permeated in all sorts of crevices which might reasonably have been expected to prove water tight With the pride of a boy on his second trip I could not bring myself to own up to my discomfort If I had the Captain would have instantly changed his pace but it seemed a soft and un Western admission to make so I suffered in external silence while inwardly heaping every insult I could think of upon the Captain s mount We were travelling long distances so the gait was rarely changed unless I made some excuse to loiter behind and then walked my pony in slow and solitary comfort until the Captain was almost out of sight and it was time to press into a lope which comfortably and far too rapidly once more put me even with him The Captain was a silent companion he would ride along hour after hour chewing a long black cigar in a silence broken only by verses he would hum to himself There was one that went on interminably beginning I wonder if ever a cowboy Will be seen in those days long to come I wonder if ever an Indian Will be seen in that far bye and bye Every now and then some butte would suggest a reminiscence of the early days and a few skilfully directed questions would lure him into a chain of anecdotes of the already vanished border life He was continually coming out with a quotation from some author with whose writings I had never thought him acquainted Fishing in a Black Hills stream I heard him mutter So you heard the left fork of the Yuba As you stood on the banks of the Po He had read much of Kipling s prose and poetry but what he most often quoted were the lines to Fighting Bob Evans In his house in Deadwood he had a good library the sort of one which made you feel that the books had been selected to read and enjoy and not bought by the yard like window curtains or any other furnishings thought necessary for a house Mrs Bullock was president of the Women s Literary Club and I remember father being much impressed with the work that she was doing As I have said before the Captain was a man whom changing conditions could not throw to one side He would anticipate the changes and himself take the lead in them adapting himself to the new conditions you could count upon finding him on top He was very proud of the fact that he had brought the first alfalfa to the State and showed me his land near Belle Fourche where he had planted the original crop Its success was immediate He said that he could not claim the credit of having introduced potatoes but an old friend of his was entitled to the honor and he delighted in telling the circumstances The Captain s friend whom we can call Judge Jones for I ve forgotten his name had opened a trading post in what was at that time the wild territory of Dakota The Indians were distinctly hostile and at any good opportunity were ready to raid the posts murdering the factors and looting the trading goods In the judge s territory there was one particularly ugly customer half Indian and half negro known as Nigger Bill The judge was much interested in the success of his adventure in potatoes and the following was one of the letters he received from his factor as Seth Bullock used to quote it to me DEAR JUDGE This is to tell you all is well here and I hope is same with you Nigger Bill came to the door of the stockade to day and said I am going to get in I said Nigger Bill you will not get in Nigger Bill said I will get in I shot Nigger Bill He is dead The potatoes is doing fine Although realizing to the full that the change was inevitable and of course to the best interests of the country and naturally taking much pride in the progress his State was making the Captain could not help at times feeling a little melancholy over the departed days when there was no wire in the country and one could ride where one listed He wrote me in The part of South Dakota which you knew has all been covered with the shacks of homesteaders from Belle Fourche to Medora and from the Cheyenne agency to the Creek Where the Old Woman Died The old times had gone never to return and although the change was an advance it closed an existence that could never be forgotten or relived by those who had taken part in it The Captain gave me very sound advice when I was trying to make up my mind whether or not to go to college I was at the time going through the period of impatience that comes to so many boys when they feel that they are losing valuable time during which they should be starting in to make their way in the world I had talked it over with the Captain during one of the summer trips and soon afterward he wrote me Ride the old studies with spurs I don t like the idea of your going out to engage in business until you have gone through Harvard You will have plenty of time after you have accomplished this to tackle the world Take my advice my boy and don t think of it A man without a college education nowadays is badly handicapped If he has had the opportunity to go through college and does not take advantage of it he goes through life with a regret that becomes more intensified as he gets older Life is a very serious proposition if we would live it well I went through college and I have often realized since how excellent this advice was and marvelled not a little at the many sidedness of a frontiersman who could see that particular situation so clearly Illustration A morning s bag of prairie chicken in South Dakota Seth Bullock is second from the left and R H Munro Ferguson third The year before I went with my father to Africa R H Munro Ferguson and myself joined the Captain in South Dakota for a prairie chicken hunt We were to shoot in the vicinity of the Cheyenne Indian reservation and the Captain took us through the reservation to show us how the Indian question was being handled The court was excellently run but what impressed us most was the judge s name for he was called Judge No Heart Some of our hunting companions rejoiced in equally unusual names There were Spotted Rabbit No Flesh Yellow Owl and High Hawk not to forget Spotted Horses whose prolific wife was known as Mrs Drops Two at a Time We had with us another man named Dave Snowball who looked and talked just like a Southern darky As a matter of fact he was half negro and half Indian In the old days negro slaves not infrequently escaped and joined the Indians I went to see Dave s father There was no mistaking him for what he was but when I spoke to him he would answer me in Sioux and the only English words I could extract from him were No speak English He may have had some hazy idea that if he talked English some one would arrest him and send him back to his old masters although they had probably been dead for thirty or forty years Possibly living so long among the Sioux he had genuinely forgotten the language of his childhood High Hawk and Oliver Black Hawk were old hostiles So was Red Bear We came upon him moving house The tepee had just been dismantled and the support poles were being secured to a violently objecting pony A few weeks later when we were on the train going East Frederic Remington joined us He was returning from Montana and upon hearing that we had been on the Cheyenne reservation he asked if we had run into old Red Bear who had once saved his life He told us that many years before he had been picked up by a party of hostiles and they had determined to give him short shrift when Red Bear with whom he had previously struck a friendship turned up and successfully interceded with his captors One reminiscence led to another and we were soon almost as grateful to Red Bear for having opened such a store as Remington had been for having his life spared Frederic Remington was a born raconteur and pointed his stories with a bluff homely philosophy redolent of the plains and the sage brush The night before we left the Indians the Captain called a council All the old hostiles and many of the younger generation gathered The peace pipes circulated We had brought with us from New York a quantity of German porcelain pipes to trade with the Indians Among them was one monster with a bowl that must have held from an eighth to a quarter of a pound of tobacco The Indians ordinarily smoke kinnikinick which is chopped up willow bark It is mild and gives a pleasant aromatic smoke The tobacco which we had was a coarse strong shag We filled the huge pipe with it and lighting it passed it round among the silent solemn figures grouped about the fire The change was as instantaneous as it was unpremeditated The first brave drew deeply and inhaled a few strong puffs with a choking splutter he handed the pipe to his nearest companion The scene was repeated and as each Indian heedless of the fate of his comrades inhaled the smoke of the strong shag he would break out coughing until the pipe had completed the circuit and the entire group was coughing in unison Order was restored and willow bark substituted for tobacco with satisfactory results Then we each tried our hand at speaking One by one the Indians took up the thread grunting out their words between puffs The firelight rose and fell lighting up the shrouded shapes When my turn came I spoke through an interpreter Coached by the Captain as to what were their most lamentable failings those that most frequently were the means of his making their acquaintance I gave a learned discourse upon the evils of rustling ponies and the pleasant life that lay before those who abstained from doing so Grunts of approval how sincere I know not were the gratifying reply to my efforts The powwow broke up with a substantial feast of barbecued sheep and next morning we left our nomadic hosts to continue their losing fight to maintain their hereditary form of existence hemmed in by an ever encroaching white man s civilization Near the reservation we came upon two old outlaw buffaloes last survivors of the great herds that not so many years previously had roamed these plains providing food and clothing for the Indians until wiped out by the ruthless white man These two bulls living on because they were too old and tough for any one to bother about were the last survivors left in freedom A few days later we were shown by Scottie Phillips over his herd He had many pure breeds but more hybrids and the latter looked the healthier Scottie had done a valuable work in preserving these buffalo He was a squaw man and his pleasant Indian wife gave us excellent buffalo berry preserves that she had put up Scottie s ranch typified the end of both buffalo and Indian Before a generation is past the buffalo will survive only in the traces of it left by crossing with cattle and the same fate eventually awaits the Indian No matter how wise be the course followed in governing the remnants of the Indian race it can only be a question of time before their individuality sinks and they are absorbed The spring following this expedition I set off with father for Africa The Captain took a great deal of interest in the plans for the trip A week before we sailed he wrote I send you to day by American Express the best gun I know of for you to carry when in Africa It is a single action Colts on a heavy frame It is a business weapon always reliable and will shoot where you hold it When loaded carry it on the safety or first cock of the hammer Seth Bullock was a hero worshipper and father was his great hero It would have made no difference what father did or said the Captain would have been unshakably convinced without going into the matter at all that father was justified There is an old adage that runs Any one can have friends that stand by him when he s right what you want is friends that stand by you when you re wrong Seth Bullock had occasion ever demanded it would have been one of the latter In the Cuban War he was unable to get into the Rough Riders and so joined a cowboy regiment which was never fortunate enough to get over to Cuba but suffered all its casualties and there were plenty of them from typhoid fever in a camp somewhere in the South He was made a sort of honorary member of the Rough Riders and when there were informal reunions held in Washington he was counted upon to take part in them He was a favorite with every one from the White House ushers to the French Ambassador As an honorary member of the Tennis Cabinet he was present at the farewell dinner held in the White House three days before father left the presidency A bronze cougar by Proctor had been selected as a parting gift and it was concealed under a mass of flowers in the centre of the table The Captain had been chosen to make the presentation speech and when he got up and started fumbling with flowers to disclose the cougar father could not make out what had happened The Captain as he said himself was a poor hand at saying good by He was in New York shortly before we sailed for Africa but wrote I must leave here to day for Sioux Falls then again I am a mollycoddle when it comes to bidding good by can always easier write good by than speak it His gloomy forebodings about the Brazilian trip were well justified He was writing me to South America I was glad to hear you will be with your father I have been uneasy about this trip of his but now that I know you are along I will be better satisfied I don t think much of that country you are to explore as a health resort and there are no folks like home folks when one is sick The Captain made up his mind that if his regiment had failed to get into the Cuban War the same thing would not happen in the case of another war In July when the Mexican situation seemed even more acute than usual I heard from the Captain If we have war with Mexico you and I will have to go I am daily in receipt of application from the best riders in the country Tell the Colonel I have carried out his plan for the forming of a regiment and within fifteen days from getting word from him will have a regiment for his division that will meet with his approval You are to have a captaincy to start with I don t think Wilson will fight without he is convinced it will aid in his election He is like Artemus Ward willing to sacrifice his wife s relations on the altar of his country The Mexican situation continued to drag along but we at length entered the European war and for a while it looked as if my father would be allowed to raise a division and take it over to the other side The Captain had already the nucleus of his regiment and the telegrams passed fast and furiously However for reasons best known to the authorities in Washington it all turned out to be to no purpose The Captain was enraged He wrote me out to Mesopotamia where I was serving in the British forces I was very much disgusted with Wilson when he turned us down I had a splendid organization twelve hundred strong comprising four hundred miners from the Black Hills Mines four hundred railroad boys from the lines of the Chicago and Northwestern and the C B and Q in South Dakota Western Nebraska and Wyoming and four hundred boys from the ranges of Western South Dakota Montana and Wyoming It was the pick of the country Your troop was especially good while locally known as the Deadwood troop most of the members were from the country northwest of Belle Fourche twenty of your troop were Sioux who had served on the Indian police Sixty five per cent of the regiment had military training Damn the dirty politics that kept us from going I am busy now locally with the Red Cross and the Exemption Board of this county being chairman of each We will show the Democrats that we are thoroughbreds and will do our bit even if we are compelled to remain at home with the Democrats After expatiating at some length and with great wealth of detail as to just what he thought of the attitude of the administration the Captain continued with some characteristic advice I am going to caution you now on being careful when you are on the firing line Don t try for any Victoria Cross or lead any forlorn hopes modern war does not require these sacrifices nor are battles won that way nowadays I wouldn t have you fail in any particular of a brave American soldier and I know you won t but there is a vast difference between bravery and foolhardiness and a man with folks at home is extremely selfish if unnecessarily foolhardy in the face of danger All of it very good sound advice and just such as the Captain might have been expected to give but the last in the world that any one would have looked for him to personally follow The letter ended with I think the war will be over this year I did want to ride a spotted cayuse into Berlin but it don t look now as if I would The next time that I heard from the Captain was some time after I had joined the American Expeditionary Forces in France In characteristic fashion he addressed the letter merely Care of General Pershing France and naturally the letter took three or four months before it finally reached me The Captain had been very ill but treated the whole matter as a joke I have just returned from California where I was on the sick list since last December six months in a hospital and sanitarium while the doctors were busy with knives and nearly took me over the divide I am recovering slowly and hope to last till the Crown Prince and his murdering progenitor are hung I was chairman of the Exemption Board in and stuck to it until I was taken ill with grippe which ended in an intestinal trouble which required the services of two surgeons and their willing knives to combat The folks came to California after the remains but when they arrived they found the remains sitting up and cussing the Huns Now Kim take care of yourself don t get reckless Kill all the Huns you can but don t let them have the satisfaction of getting you My father s death was a fearful blow to the old Captain Only those who knew him well realized how hard he was hit He immediately set to work to arrange some monument to my father s memory With the native good taste that ever characterized him instead of thinking in terms of statues he decided that the dedication of a mountain would be most fitting and determined to make the shaft to be placed upon its summit simple in both form and inscription Father was the one honorary member of the Society of Black Hills Pioneers and it was in conjunction with this society that the Captain arranged that Sheep Mountain a few miles away from Deadwood should be renamed Mount Roosevelt General Wood made the address A number of my friends who were there gave me the latest news of the Captain He wrote me that he expected to come East in September that he was not feeling very fit and that he was glad to have been able to go through with the dedication of the mountain He was never a person to talk about himself so I have no way of knowing other than intuition but I am certain that he felt all along that his days were numbered and held on mainly in order to accomplish his purpose of raising the memorial I waited until the middle of September and then wrote to Deadwood to ask the Captain when he would be coming I found the reply in the newspapers a few days later The Captain was dead The gallant old fellow had crossed the divide that he wrote about leaving behind him not merely the sorrow of his friends but their pride in his memory Well may we feel proud of having been numbered among the friends of such a thoroughgoing upstanding American as Seth Bullock As long as our country produces men of such caliber we may face the future with a consciousness of our ability to win through such dark days as may confront us The changes and shiftings that have ever accompanied our growth never found Seth Bullock at a loss he was always ready to Turn a keen untroubled face Home to the instant need of things Throughout his well rounded and picturesque career he coped with the varied problems that confronted him in that unostentatious and unruffled way so peculiarly his own with which he faced the final and elemental fact of his recall from service FOOTNOTES Fifteen years later when I was in Medora with Captain Seth Bullock Muley was still alive and enjoying a life of ease in Joe Ferris s pastures Shenzi really means bushman but it is applied generally in a derogatory sense by the Swahilis to all the wild natives or blanket Indians Since writing this we have heard from a

set encoding UTF Produced by Greg Weeks Mary Meehan and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http www pgdp net START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OPEN INVITATION OPEN INVITATION A Short Story by H B FYFE The problem was simple or rather simply stated Zoya Lar Tul must keep those nasty aggressive little Earthmen from discovering the location of his home star Transcriber s Note This etext was produced from Planet Stories May Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U S copyright on this publication was renewed As Ullo Dah Gow waddled into the section communications chamber on Yaradir second planet of Zillor two of his four walking tentacles stuck slightly on a nearly dry spot Fire and dry sand he swore at the technicians Can t you two even keep the footing decently moist Without waiting for an answer he made his way to the row of shallow mud tubs before the television screen The operators aimed eyestalks at each other Finally Yado Nol Moz as junior rose and went to the wall controls of the conditioner The assistant supervisor was relieved to see a thin sheet of water creep across the floor He never knew when Yado or Viri Nol Rin might choose to ignore him Which comes of old Ahnu loading this section with his nephews he thought bitterly forgetting that in his own office he already had a list of his own relatives prepared against the day when he should succeed to the post of Supervisor of Colonial Scouting for Sector The slap slap of tentacles in the corridor announced the arrival of his superior Ahnu Nol Yev entered and lowered his thick body into the choicest of the mud tubs which Ullo had prudently left free Now what s this urgent message he demanded pointing one eyestalk at Ullo and fixing the other upon the screen above Viri s broad bony head A request for orders from scout Zoya Lar Tul answered Viri Assigned to let me see system LL Did we have any report on that system asked Ahnu Yado produced the tape of a preliminary report and placed it on the speaker The list of facts rolled out number of planets number with sufficient water for colonization number of intelligent species one on third planet native nomenclature star Sol own planet Earth others and so on All right wheezed Ahnu I remember now Get hold of whatsisname Zoya Viri manipulated his keys and knobs The brief delay before an answering image appeared on the screen irritated Ahnu The loose coppery scales around his thick neck glinted with iridescent highlights as he puffed out his air sacs Dessication he snarled We bridge all those light years with subspace waves for his benefit and he can t be alert enough to Got him now Viri The technician snapped the tip of a gripping tentacle in assent Another Yaradirian looked out at them from the screen This one had obviously been roughing it his scales were lubricated by only a minimum film of moisture and he wore space harness on the lower part of his body To keep his walking tentacles wet Ullo realized He hasn t so much as a drop of water on the floor of that dive Zoya Lar Tul announced Viri Stated simply said Ahnu bluntly what is your trouble Stated simply Great One answered the scout I am in imminent danger of detection by natives of this system Ullo stiffened in his mud tub He heard the slurp as the Supervisor splashed more mud upon the oozing floor How is that demanded Ahnu his throat again beginning to expand majestically I fail to see replied Zoya in what manner I could have avoided it Great One The natives Earthmen in their own speech have just discovered an inefficient form of our own interstellar subspace drive They have gone exploring Might have known it thought Ullo Just when I m working up to a top rank too It sounded bad Should they be unable to think Zoya out of his predicament it might well mean new personnel all around Ullo s only satisfaction was that Ahnu s relatives would be discharged before his own resignation was given him to sign Ahnu controlled himself Give me a picture of your situation he commanded To begin with Great One I chose to study the natives from a distance as is usual I left my subspace ship on the largest satellite of their sixth planet which has several other moons and a beautiful set of rings that Kindly touch bottom Ahnu cut him off I am not interested in a local travelogue Even so Great One With my short range rocket I then established this base on the seventh moon of their fifth planet Only this moon s smallness and insignificance has so far prevented by discovery They listened to the rest of the story in an uncomfortable silence that was broken only by an occasional squishing of mud as one or another stirred uneasily Zoya Lar Tul had observed the Earthmen as well as other bodies in the system for a quarter revolution of his chosen fifth planet At the time of his arrival the natives had reached their own satellite but he judged that they would be long in organizing successful flights to the planets I translated some of their broadcasts and learned that this was their great current project Naturally however I was unconcerned and contented myself with obtaining specimens for my researches by brief discreet trips here and there Ullo snapped his tentacle tip quietly in assent He remembered from his history the dreadfully long period of his own race s expansion throughout the system of Zillor These Earthmen however seemed from Zoya s report to possess certain advantages Their requirements of air and water were moderate and more easily stored in a space vessel If they had discovered a form of subspace drive they might be energetic enough to pop up in the vicinity of Zillor some fine day You will imagine my amazement continued Zoya when I heard one of their broadcasts announce that a ship had reached their fourth planet and another the second Ahnu blew out a long bubbling breath All this is doubtless interesting he snorted but what is the immediate emergency The image of Zoya aimed both eyestalks rather deliberately at the Supervisor They reached and passed this group of satellites he hissed out Do I make clear my dilemma Great One He waited while Ahnu s neck swelled dangerously Just before the explosion he continued Should they discover me they will also find the specimens I have collected except the choicer ones stored on my subspace vessel for transport home This is what I mean Zoya reached out to touch a button and the scene changed to what was evidently the dissecting laboratory of his base Behind a transparent bulkhead hung several sorts of carcasses in various stages of dismemberment Ullo suspected that the storeroom was simply left at the temperature of the moon s surface Very well exclaimed Ahnu as the scout reappeared You seem to be operating a sort of butcher shop with some of the most ugly specimens ever seen What about it Ullo felt sorry for the scout Even he indeed as he saw by the twitch of their eyestalks even the technicians had realized the problem Zoya patiently explained forbearing to mention that his instructions were laid out by Ahnu If you will refer to descriptions in my preliminary report Great One you will see that certain of the specimens are Earthmen themselves Should their explorers discover them I have reason to believe they would be resentful It is my opinion that they are a belligerent race Ahnu was silent for a moment Well yes that is possible he admitted It would appear he continued in another moment that you must either abandon your base or dispose of your specimens if as you say the Earthmen have so soon reached your vicinity Zoya waited Ullo stirred in his tub If I may suggest Great One Yes I believe he should destroy his subspace ship What I am inclined to agree Zoya Lar Tul put in Amazed Ahnu waited for Ullo s reasons Encouraged by such consideration the latter went on If these Earthmen are already on their way to the ringed planet they will undoubtedly stop first at the largest moon where Zoya has left his main ship And will likely discover it there Ahnu agreed reluctantly And from that point continued Ullo they will discover both our location in space and the interstellar subspace drive in its finished form After that they can get at us The opposite extreme of my dilemma confirmed Zoya Silence ordered Ahnu Let me think All of them Supervisor assistant technicians and the image on the screen considered the situation gloomily The government of Yaradir would take a dry view of having to combat an invasion should one develop from this The race of Yaradir because of their personal requirements and life conditions were not as numerous as most of the races they had found in their explorations The great distances between their colonies and the growing number of these were due to the comparative rarity of the type of planet that suited them Can you reach the ship in your local rocket in time to escape in it asked Ahnu After all subspace ships are costly if we leave a deserted base what can they find out It is possible admitted Zoya doubtfully but risky What do you mean They may intercept me on the way for their ships are faster than my rocket They may even catch the big ship before I gain enough speed to shift into subspace drive For all we know interrupted Ullo forgetting his place they may be able to keep up with you even then Ahnu bubbled angrily at the idea but they all were silent for another unhappy period of cogitation Perhaps admitted Ahnu in the end you will have to destroy the subspace ship but only in the last extremity I could blow it up from space if I get within range Not so fast that ship is a major item in the budget Ahnu told him angrily The first thing is to try to get aboard unseen and return to pick up what you can from your base And if these Earthmen are nearby Ullo asked Then Zoya must forget the base and escape with the ship which is the main thing But if they have already found it inquired Zoya All right all right Then destroy it And you had better start immediately unless you wish to find such action necessary Somehow here one eyestalk was deflected rather pointedly toward Ullo somehow too many mouths always speed up the clocks Ullo did a little neck swelling himself at this example of bias Just because he couldn t get my job for his youngest brother he thought resentfully Serve him right if I d resigned Where d he be if I didn t stick here to push his snout into the obvious every time he slides over it Yes repeated Ahnu complacent at having found his solution that is what you must do If anything goes wrong you can still use your rocket to return to your base Which I hope sighed Zoya to find undisturbed At that Ahnu fell silent After a tense moment he heaved himself around to direct both eyestalks at Ullo Well he wheezed Have you no suggestions in case he does have to destroy the subspace ship Ullo twirled one tentacle tip in the mud of his tub until he collected a sticky blob This he flipped away with a snap of the tentacle He derived a slight satisfaction from the splat against the far wall We must try to preserve one of his collections of information he said It would entail considerable expense not to mention time to replace Zoya and repeat the scouting Ahnu shifted his position irritably Ullo saw that his reference to expense had been a shrewd blow The Supervisor snorted and bubbled but finally conceded that much and gestured for Ullo to continue So it would be unfortunate if he should succeed in regaining his big ship only to return to his base and find it occupied by exploring Earthmen What do you suggest then He should try for either the base or the ship and arrange to destroy the other If he can remain undetected for a short time at the base he can dispose of his specimens after forwarding a report on them If he gets to the ship safely why leave behind any clues at all After considerable wheezing and puffing it was agreed that Zoya should take a chance on having his base discovered while he was away but provide for the eventuality by arranging a bomb that would be set off by the approach of any strange ship He admitted that he already had one keyed to be safe only after certain signals from his own rocket He had only to hook it up If you do have to return advised Ullo clean out your dissecting room and then make friends with the Earthmen Give them some story of being cast away and ask help in building a new ship You mean install our kind of drive without their knowing Exactly said Ahnu taking to the idea Then just drop out of sight some fine day and leave them wondering which way you went At this point Viri made bold to request that Zoya leave the televisor at the base operating with a continuous view of the main chamber as now shown He began to explain that he wanted to be sure not to lose contact but Ahnu had heard enough He cut Viri short by climbing out of his mud tub That settles it then he summed up to Zoya If you are forced to destroy the subspace ship report from the base when you return and are ready to contact the natives Otherwise report from the ship He waddled out of the communications chamber without ceremony followed by Ullo Dah Gow The next day the latter was kept busy with the many reports of arid planets he had to file in order to justify the expenses of exploration He always leaves explaining the budget to me he thought He did however snatch time to put a copy tape of the last installment of Zoya s preliminary report on the speaker having felt ill at ease for not being completely up to date at the previous evening s conference Halfway through a listing of sociological and psychological observations Ullo stiffened He ran the tape through again He d better get to that ship he wheezed to himself They sound like a nest of trouble makers resourceful aggressive just the sort to burst into this system some sweet day and tell us Yaradir is their colony He ripped the tape out of the speaker and hurried along a dank corridor to Ahnu s office not even pausing at his favorite spots to rub against the cool dripping walls He found his chief relaxing in an adjoining chamber by submitting to a massage Not now complained Ahnu at the first mention of Earthmen Wait till we hear from Zoya I want to enjoy having my scales oiled in peace Ullo spitefully dropped the tape into a pot of scale grease on the way out but dutifully returned to his work Late one night however he was reminded of the scout in system LL The emergency buzzer beside his sleeping pool awoke him with an urgent summons The number on the screen beside it indicated the communications chamber now reserved for Zoya Lar Tul Still dripping Ullo pumped down the corridor encountering his chief at the last turn Ahnu was irritated What can they have spoiled now he demanded as if he suspected Ullo of having had a tentacle in it It was a perfectly simple arrangement Perhaps something unexpected came up suggested Ullo What could be unexpected It was utterly simple said Ahnu explosively If he beats them to it he reports from the ship Otherwise he destroys it and goes back to report from his base He slap slapped irately into their destination wondering audibly why he had to come down here and direct people s eyestalks for them Because Great One replied Viri Nol Rin a trifle more abruptly than was consistent with proper respect for Ahnu s position the televisor at Zoya s base has gone dead What Why If you can t keep in communication There isn t any communication interrupted Viri Ullo saw that the operator was deeply disturbed To interrupt actually interrupt Ahnu Nol Yev Even if one was his nephew That is why if you will remember Viri went on I insisted Zoya leave his signal in operation The chance that his base would be approached by a strange ship sooner than we hoped and blow up So the bomb went off said Ullo It must have And by the figures Zoya gave me before he left he is long long overdue at the subspace ship Well what of it demanded Ahnu It merely means he will have to report from the ship when he if he if they don t He snorted and wheezed into silence Ullo traded stares with Viri Then he looked at Yado who wore an equally unhappy expression on his wide visage Are you sure he would have reached the ship before now Ahnu demanded Completely The Supervisor swore feelingly using some of the bleakest and driest terms Ullo had ever heard The gist of the diatribe was the delay and expense Now it may be yaras before we get his data How do you mean asked Ullo It s obvious isn t it He must have had to destroy the ship but before he got back some prowling Earthmen set off the charge at his base That leaves him with only his rocket Don t you see what it means Perhaps not said Ullo Why he ll have to make friends with those things from Earth and get help building a new ship Until then we ll have to classify his report pending He sloshed watery mud about as he heaved himself from his tub impatiently Ullo aimed an eyestalk at each of the technicians keeping them silent until Ahnu had waddled indignantly from the room I knew we didn t cover all the alternatives that night said Ullo feelingly How could we be so dry inside the skull How could we He certainly doesn t like the delay commented Yado Delay snorted Ullo Then he asked Is that what it means to you too Viri and Yado fidgeted under his stare I keep wondering if Zoya reached the ship said Ullo They stared at him Say it this way then If Zoya reached the ship Viri sighed I suppose we may never find out what really happened he said I believe I would really rather not Ullo told them preparing to leave Listen in to a complete copy of the preliminary report Zoya sent and you will see what I mean His scales were too dry and needed an oiling he told himself but he knew it was more than that which sent the shudder through him And there were billions of them What shall we do asked Viri I don t know what good it will do said Ullo pausing in the doorway but you might make your wills Personally I intend to apply for transfer to some colony lying in the opposite direction from this Sol Record of us and a ship to reach us we might as well have sent them an invitation He remembered their unhappy eyes two yaras later when the regular bulletin tapes sent out to the colonies reported Ahnu s dismissal Ullo applied for a post at a more distant colony After one yara at the new post the monthly tapes from Yaradir were interrupted Everybody complained about the service Everybody but Ullo He commandeered a subspace

From Greenland s icy mountains From India s coral strand Where Afric s sunny fountains Roll down their golden sand From many an ancient river From many a palmy plain They call us to deliver Their land from error s chain There is not one of you my dear boys and girls who does not know this oft sung missionary hymn But if there is then of this I am sure there is not one who knows it who does not love it for it is one of the most beautiful of all our hymns Since it was written many years ago by Bishop Heber hundreds and hundreds of young voices have sung it hundreds and hundreds are singing it to day and hundreds and hundreds will yet sing it It is a great call to us who know Christ our Saviour to spread abroad into all heathen lands our knowledge of Him who came down from heaven and died to save mankind And nobly has the call been responded to The Christian Churches have sent forth messengers into all the ends of the earth to preach the glad tidings of great joy which shall be to all people in obedience to the command of their risen Lord who said Go ye therefore and teach all nations So in our own day we find that Christ s ambassadors have gone into every continent and penetrated into the most distant lands that the Bible or some part of it at least has been translated into many different languages and that the lives of countless numbers of native peoples have been made purer and holier and happier by their knowledge of Him who loves them As you all know one of the continents of the earth is called Africa the dark Continent and it is about Africa and its children I want to write to you CHAPTER II THE DARK CONTINENT Africa has been called the Dark Continent and the name is suitable in more ways than one To the European people it was for ages a dark continent because it was unknown that is unexplored by them The name is also appropriate because Africa is the home of millions of dark skinned people But from a Christian point of view Africa is the dark continent because over most of its inhabitants there still hangs a black cloud of heathen darkness that shuts out the glorious rays of the Gospel of Light and Love Of course you must know that Africa has not all been an unknown land The northern part of it which borders the Mediterranean Sea has been known from ancient times And is not Egypt the land of the Nile and the home of the Pharaohs in Africa although we sometimes do not realise it But it is not so much of these northern lands that I want to tell you as about the far greater portion that stretches away south over the Equator right down to the Cape This part was until not so long ago the dark unknown continent the land of those teeming millions of dark skinned people who lived out their lives without ever hearing the Gospel story and without knowing the love of God for the children of men For hundreds of years very very little was known of this vast land lying away to the south The ancient peoples must have been afraid to explore it and it is no wonder for Africa is a land full of dangers and difficulties that must have appeared overwhelming to the ancients Here is a description of part of a voyage along the African Coast made in the old days I read it the other day in a nice book about Central Africa Having taken in water we sailed thence straight forwards until we came to a great gulf which the interpreter said was called the Horn of the West In it was a large island and in the island a lake like a sea and in this another island on which we landed and by day we saw nothing but woods but by night we saw many fires burning and heard the sounds of flutes and cymbals and the beating of drums and an immense shouting Fear came upon us and the soothsayers bade us quit the island Having speedily set sail we passed by a burning country full of incense and from it huge streams of fire flowed into the sea and the land could not be walked upon because of the heat Being alarmed we speedily sailed away thence also and going along four days we saw by night the land full of flame and in the midst was a lofty fire greater than the rest and seeming to touch the stars This by day appeared as a vast mountain called the Chariot of the Gods On the third day from this sailing by fiery streams we came to a gulf called the Horn of the South After reading such a description do you wonder that the ancients left the land to the south severely alone We to day can give a very simple explanation for the above fiery exhibition These ancient mariners had evidently visited that part of Africa at the time of the bush fires and were consequently appalled In the year a Portuguese navigator called Diaz sighted the Cape of Good Hope and a fellow countryman Vasco da Gama a few years later discovered Natal and the Cape route to India But of inland exploration there was little or none till men like James Bruce and Mungo Park made their famous journeys in the interior the one on the Blue Nile and the other on the Niger Then bit by bit our knowledge of the interior of Africa was added to by such brave men of whom Dr Livingstone is the most famous If you ever get the opportunity of looking at an old map of Africa you will find that most of the interior is blank But now the map of Africa is filled with names and features that are known to us through exploration Mighty rivers and great lakes have been discovered and mountains of which the ancients only dreamed are familiar to us All honour to the brave men who have laid us so heavily under their debt and to no one more than to David Livingstone whose noble example was as an inspiration and who as missionary and explorer laid down his life for the Dark Continent But for many years the European nations only looked upon Africa as a land whence slaves were to be taken for their plantations in the New World And this part of the history of Africa is a dark blot upon their fair fame What with the European slave buying in the West the Arab slave hunting in the East and the chiefs perpetually at war and enslaving one another s people the lives of countless numbers of these ignorant people were made miserable in the extreme The village lies slumbering peacefully in the hollow in the midst of its gardens of maize and sweet potatoes It is silently surrounded before dawn by the cruel Arab and his men Shots ring out The startled inhabitants rush forth into the grey morning with shouts of Nkondo War Nkondo War The men who resist or try to flee are ruthlessly shot down Houses and gardens are burned and destroyed the dead and dying are left where they fall round the necks of the living is riveted the hateful slave stick and the gang is on its way to the coast leaving behind only the abomination of desolation Too often alas have the children of Africa tasted of this bitter cup And now that the European people know the sin from which they were freed by the mercy of God it behoves them to try their best to make up to the black people for the injury they formerly did them That much is being done we know for the whole continent is marked out as belonging to the different European nations and is ruled by them So the days of the old tribal wars are over and the slave hunter has disappeared from the land The future of the Dark Continent you will then see lies now to a large extent in the hands of the people of Europe The old rule of the native chiefs has in most places passed away and in others is rapidly passing The power has gone into the hands of the white man Pray God he may use it wisely and guide his black brother towards the green pastures as becomes a follower of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ CHAPTER III THE GREAT RACES OF AFRICA Before I begin to speak to you about the children of Africa I would like you to understand how the people of Africa are separated into different families or divisions There are in Africa nearly two hundred millions of people but they do not all belong to the same race The three big families are the Berbers in the north the Negroes in the middle and the Bantus in the south Besides these there are some smaller divisions to which belong the Pigmies or Dwarfs those strange little people whom Stanley encountered on his famous journey through the terrible forests of the Congo Then there are the Hottentots and the Bushmen of the south west corner of Africa who have been driven into the desert and hilly places by the more powerful invading Bantu tribes Many long years ago the whole of the northern part of Africa was invaded by large numbers of fierce Arab tribes They were very warlike and soon overran the whole country and settled down in it and lived side by side with the original people of the country as their masters but with whom they afterwards mingled So the North Africans of to day are you see a people of mixed race These hordes of conquering Arabs who overran the country were Mohammedans and they forced their religion upon the people among whom they settled Mohammedanism is therefore the chief religion of the north of Africa Now these Berber tribes are very dark skinned when compared with Europeans but they do not belong to the black people They are in fact classed along with the white races The true black people are the Negroes and their home is in the middle part of Africa which stretches eastwards right across from the West Coast They are the people with the black skins the woolly heads the thick lips the flat noses and the beautiful white teeth It is they whose forefathers were bought as slaves and taken to America where we find their descendants to day They were a heathen people and had many cruel customs and some of them were cannibals Mohammedanism has come upon them from the north and the east and a great many of them now belong to that religion The home of the Bantu people is the great southern portion of Africa The Bantus are not so black as are the Negroes nor are they quite so thick lipped and flat nosed But in all other ways they are very similar to their Negro neighbours They are a heathen people although Christianity has made good progress among them They are brave and intelligent and are showing themselves able to adopt a higher and better way of living The other smaller tribes the Pigmies the Hottentots and the Bushmen are far below the Negroes and Bantus in intelligence The first of these the Pigmies or Dwarfs inhabit the dense forest region of the Congo and not very much is known about them even to day The Hottentots and the Bushmen live away down in the extreme south west of Africa and the Kalahari Desert It is said that they are the descendants of the older inhabitants of Africa who had to seek refuge in the hills and deserts from the powerful Bantu tribes who invaded and seized their country Now I think this will be quite enough information about the different races dwelling in Africa What I want you to understand is that the whole of the northern portion of Africa is Mohammedan that the Negro people are many already Mohammedan and that others are rapidly being converted to that religion and that the Bantu people are mostly yet heathen while some have become Christian especially those of the south In Africa there is a great war going on Three mighty forces or powers are fighting against one another and victory cannot go to them all These great forces are Mohammedanism heathenism and Christianity But to those of us who know the African it is plain that the great fight will be between the first and the last that the Africans will be ruled by the Cross or the Crescent that the Bible or the Koran will be their Holy Book that Mohammed or Christ will be their guide in this life Already we see that the whole of the north follows the Prophet of Mecca The nature worship of the Negro and Bantu although yet strong will pass away with the passing years The south is largely Christian and Christianity is pushing up northwards Christian missions are attacking the strongholds of Mohammedanism and heathenism in the north west and east in Egypt and the newly opened Soudan CHAPTER IV AN AFRICAN HOUSE You must be wondering when you are going to hear about the children of Africa for I am sure you want to know about them now the little sons and daughters of the big black people I have so far written about Well it so happens that I am sitting writing this story in a native hut in Africa many thousands of miles away from you and if any of you wanted to come and join me here and see for yourselves you would have to travel a good many weeks to reach me Will you let me first try to describe this house I am in and the village of which it is part as being what most African huts and villages are like and in which black boys and girls are born and play This hut is a square one and a good deal larger than you would imagine It is the size of a small cottage at home Long ago most of the huts were round I believe and indeed many of them are so yet But square ones have come into fashion here for even in far off Africa there is such a thing as fashion and it can change too This hut is divided into three rooms The middle one is provided with a door to the front and another to the back The rooms on each side have very small windows like spy holes looking out to each end All round the house runs a verandah which prevents the fierce rays of the sun from beating against the walls of the house and throws off the heavy showers of rain of the wet season clear of the house The whole house is built of grass and bamboos and is smeared over with mud inside and out The roof supported by stout cross beams in the middle of the partition walls in which other forked beams stand slopes not very steeply down to the verandah posts which hold up its lower edges It is heavily thatched with fine long grass The owner knows by experience what a tropical thunder shower means so he leaves nothing to chance in thatching his house In the middle of the floor in the room with the doors a small hole has been scooped It is surrounded with stones and forms the cooking hearth although there is also attached to this house a very small grass shed about a dozen yards away at the back of the house which is used as a kitchen on most occasions The doors are made of grass and bamboos and at night are put in place and held firm by a wooden cross bar Such is the house of a well off native of Africa It takes but a few weeks to build and lasts but a few years Of course in a house with such small windows it is always more or less dark In the end rooms with the spy holes it is always dark to me But black boys and girls do not seem to mind this In fact I believe they are like owls and cats and can see in the dark I am certain though of this that they can see ever so much better than white children can Illustration A VILLAGE HUT There is not much to look at in the way of furniture in a black man s house Here is a table made in imitation of a European one and some chairs too whose backs look forbiddingly straight a few cooking pots some sleeping mats a hoe or two some baskets and some odds and ends complete the list What surprises a white man is the number of things the black people can do without For instance if a white man wants to travel in this country he must first of all gather together a crowd of natives to carry him and his belongings He must have a tent and a bed pots and pans boxes of provisions a cook and servants before he can travel in comfort But if a black man goes on a journey he simply takes a pot and some food with him and maybe a mat and blanket takes his stick in his hand and his bundle on his shoulder and off he goes it may be to walk hundreds of miles before he comes to his destination To day there is no fire in the hearth There is no chimney in this house so I could not have a fire and enjoy my stay The owner however would not mind the smoke from the firewood He is used to crouching over a fire and his eyes get hardened I see in one corner there is a heap of grain called millet and in another a white ant heap It has risen in the night for I did not notice it before and I am glad that none of my belongings were in that corner of the room Nothing but iron seems amiss to the white ant His appetite is terrible and he can play sad havoc with one s property in a single night There is grain in one corner I have said and consequently there are rats The Pied Piper of Hamlin of whom you have all heard would find plenty of rats to charm in any African village Then in the houses there are many kinds of biting insects and some that don t bite but look ugly The mosquito is calling ping ping everywhere and night is made endurable only by retiring under a mosquito net The mosquito is the most dangerous insect in Africa for it has been found out by clever doctors that it is the mosquito bite that causes the dreaded malaria fever In tropical Africa nearly all the insects bite or sting even innocent looking caterpillars if touched give one itch Nor may you pull every flower you see for some of them are more stinging than nettles To day I came across two boys hoeing a road One was a bright fellow who kept things lively by singing snatches of songs and whistling at his work When I came near I spied a fine large glossy black beetle hurrying away after having been thrown up by the hoe I asked the lively youth what kind of insect it was In reply he dropped his hoe and pounced upon the unfortunate beetle and held it up to me for inspection Does it bite I asked astonished Oh yes he said look So saying he stuck the point of one of his fingers close to the head of the angry creature which promptly seized it with its pincers But one gets used to these pests and even the sight of a spider the size of a two shilling piece running up the wall does not disturb one There is one insect however you may not despise and which you can never get accustomed to the red ant He comes in millions and if he deigns to pay your house a visit while on his journey you had better leave him in possession of the place Unless you happen to head him off early with burning grass and red hot ashes you need not stay to argue with him Everything living disappears before him rats mice lizards cats dogs boys and girls men and women give way before his majesty the red ant I remember watching for half an hour an army of red ants on the march They were streaming out from a small hole in the grass crossing over a hoed road and disappearing into another hole in the grass on the other side Each was carrying a tiny load that looked like a small grain of rice and was hurrying after his neighbour as if the whole world depended on his speed Here and there on each side of the hurrying companies were scouts and officers without loads evidently engaged in keeping the others in order and in watching for enemies What I thought were grains of rice the boys told me were ana a chiswe that is white ant s children Somewhere underground there must have been dreadful war and the red ants were carrying off the spoils of victory Next there came along a poor little lizard home by eager and willing I had almost said hands pincers Here a pair were fixed in there another pair Everywhere that a pair of pincers could find a grip there was the pair I pulled the lizard out but it was quite dead So I pushed it back into the excited line and it was soon on the march again After a little there came past a curious round little object into which dozens of ants were sticking and which with ants swarming atop was being carried along with the stream I rescued this strange thing too because I was anxious to find out what it was the thing inside this living ball of ants One of the boys got a basin of water and plumped the ball into it and with a piece of wood scraped the angry insects and frothy looking stuff off Then there was revealed a tiny toad which the boys called Nantuzi It was just like a little bag with four legs one at each corner When annoyed it swells itself up like a ball and refuses to budge When seized by the ants it had promptly covered itself with a frothy sticky spittle and so was little hurt Had I not rescued it however it would have been eaten at last overcome by numbers Then I got tired watching and left the never ending ant army still on the march CHAPTER V THE AFRICAN CHILD Inside such a house as has been described and in many a smaller one are born the children of Africa At first and for a few days they are not black I am told they are pink in colour and quite light but that they soon darken The mothers and grandmothers are very pleased to welcome new babies and bath and oil them carefully Nearly all the women one meets about a village have children tied on their backs or are followed by them toddling behind These mites glisten in the sun as they are well oiled to keep their skins in good condition In some tribes very little children have no names You ask the mother of an infant what she calls her baby and she replies Alibe dzina It has no name I once asked the father of a plump little infant what the name of his child was He told me that it had not been named yet but that when the child would begin to smile and recognise people it would get a name Well I said when he smiles call him Tommy Months after I saw the child again a fine boy he was too and Tommy was his name But alas Tommy did not live more than two years He took some child trouble and died Illustration HIS FIRST SUIT Sometimes the father or the mother may give a child its name or sometimes a friend may name it Many of the names have no special meaning but some of them refer to things that happened or were seen at the time the child was born Boys and girls names differ from one another although the difference is not clear to the white man But if he stays long enough among the black children he will begin to know what are boys names and what are girls I know a bright boy who is called Mang anda In English you would have to call him Master Playful Another child I can recall is called Handifuna which means Miss they don t want me But wherever the white man is settling in Africa the people are picking up European names and it is a pity I think that the old names will pass away Little black children are not nursed and tended so carefully as white children are From a very early age they are tied on to their mother s backs and are taken everywhere It is seldom that an accident happens through a child falling out for the black children seem to have an extraordinary power of holding on If mother is too busy another back is soon found for baby to show his sticking on ability In any village you may see a group of women pounding corn in their mortars under a shady tree It is hard work this daily pounding of corn Up and down go the heavy wooden pestles Backwards and forwards go the heads of the babies tied on the mothers backs At each downward thud baby s neck gets a violent jerk but he is all unconscious of it and sleeps through an ordeal that would kill his white brother Again a woman with an infant on her back may go a journey of many miles exposed to the full blaze of the African sun Yet baby is quite comfortable and never gives a single cry unless when he is hungry Then black children have no cribs and cradles as have white ones When mother is tired of baby and there is no other back at hand she simply lays him down on a mat and leaves him to himself to do as he likes If he makes a noise well he can just make it He will disturb nobody and is allowed to cry until he is tired Unless he is known to be ill his squalling be it never so loud will attract no attention Most of the mothers are very proud of their children and oil them and shave their woolly heads with great care But in spite of all this care on the mother s part great numbers of the babies die Very often they are really killed through their mother s ignorance of how they ought to be fed and nursed when sick Then diseases like smallpox pass through the villages at intervals and carry off hundreds of children A black infant is not clothed like a white one If his mother is very proud of him he will have a string of beads round his neck or waist Round his fat little wrist or neck you will often see tied on by string a small medicine charm put there by his fond mother to protect him against disease or evil influence When the babies are big enough to toddle they begin to look out for themselves and when they have fairly found their legs they go everywhere and do almost anything they like so long as they do not give trouble A little boy s first article of clothing may be made of different coloured beads carefully woven into a square patch which he wears hanging down before him from a string of beads encircling his waist Or it may perhaps be only the skin of a small animal worn in the same way as the square of beads He may however begin with a cloth from the beginning If so his mother provides him with a yard of calico rolls it round him and sends him out into the world as proud as a white boy with his first pair of trousers He gets no special food because he is a child He eats whatever is going and whatever he can lay his hands upon Thus he grows up not unlike a little animal There is not much trouble taken with him If he lives he lives and if he dies well he is buried No fond lips have bent over him and kissed him asleep for kissing is not known to his people Nor has he learned to lisp the name of Jesus at his mother s knee It is not that his mother does not love him for she does in her own peculiar way But all are shrouded in ignorance father mother and children all held in the grip of dark superstitions from which nothing but the light of the Gospel of Love can free them CHAPTER VI AN AFRICAN VILLAGE Shall we go round the village now Well come away and we ll have a walk through it But as we are strangers and white I must warn you that many pairs of curious eyes will be watching us when we know not and all we do and say will be the talk of the village for a long time to come It is not every day that the villagers get such a good look at a white person and they will take advantage of their chance to day Babies on backs will cry if we come near them and little mites that can run will disappear behind their mothers and peep out at us feeling safe but very much afraid In fact many of the women frighten their naughty children by telling them that if they do not behave better they will send them to the white people who will eat them Consequently when a white man comes along the children often scatter in terror as from a wild beast And would not white children do just the same from a black man if they were told that he might eat them In a certain African Mission not long after school had been started for the first time it was found necessary to build a kiln for the burning of bricks But the eyes of the children had been watching the building and whatever could it be but a large oven in which to cook them So the whole school fled pell mell to their homes Of course you must remember that in several different parts of Africa some of the tribes were cannibals and even in our day there are still tribes among which the eating of human flesh is not unknown Here we come to a house not unlike the one we have already described to you but smaller and not so neatly finished The owner will not be so well off as the owner of that we occupied Let us go near along this path Here comes an old lady to receive us and there go the children round the corner and off goes baby yonder into tears and even the dogs begin to bark Banana trees grow all round the house and yonder is a small grove of them on the other side of the courtyard They are waving a welcome to us with their large ragged leaves The fruit is hanging in bunches here and there on the old trees and is evidently not yet ripe But before we are introduced to the old lady who is coming to meet us let us take a hasty glance round about First we see that the children are getting braver and are beginning to show themselves now Ragged looking little things they are who do not look overclean The skin of their bodies is too white to have been washed recently Isn t it strange that a black boy when he is dirty looks white just the opposite from a white boy who when he is dirty looks black The mother of the crying child has turned round so as to shut us off from baby s frightened gaze In one corner of the courtyard is a pot on a fire the contents of which are boiling briskly This we are informed is to be part of the evening meal which is in preparation It seems to us but a mass of green vegetable Really it consists of juicy green leaves of a certain kind plucked in the bush Over there in the shade of the bananas stand one or two mortars in which the women pound their grain and without which no village however small is complete On the verandah of the house stands the mill a very primitive one A large flat stone slightly hollowed out holds the grain which is ground down by another stone a round one being rubbed backwards and forwards over the hollow one Snuff too is ground from tobacco in this way for many of the men enjoy a pinch of snuff and not a few of the women like to smoke a pipe A fierce looking little cat is blinking up at us watching us narrowly through the dark slits in its large yellow green eyes seeming in doubt whether to run off or to put up its back at us A sleeping mat made of split reeds and spread out on the ground near the mortars is covered with maize ready to be pounded Two or three baskets are lying about some shallow some deep some large and some small That stump of a tree there serves as a seat when the shade of the bananas is thrown on it And down on the whole is pouring a flood of tropical sunshine so hot that we are glad to retire into the shade of a friendly tree But the old lady is come and offers us her left hand Her arms from the wrist almost to the elbow are covered with heavy bracelets and her legs from the ankles half way to her knees are laden with great heavy anklets of the same metal Clank clank clank like a chained prisoner goes the poor old soul when she walks Long ago she would carry these huge ornaments with no difficulty and not a little joy But now although proud of them still no doubt they must be a trouble to her slipping up and down on her withered arms and legs for she has tried to protect her old ankles by wrapping round them a rag of calico to keep the brass from hurting She is dressed in a single calico none too new but we are pleased to see very clean Other calicoes doubtless she will possess carefully stored away and hidden in a basket in the darkest corner of her house Her old face is a mass of wrinkles and she has lost nearly all her teeth But her upper lip What a sight Poor old creature what a huge ring there is in it Why we can see right into her mouth when she speaks and to us it is not a pleasant sight This ring seen in many old women is called here a pelele Men do not wear it When a girl is young her upper lip is bored in the middle and a small piece of bone is put into the hole to keep it open Gradually larger and larger pieces are put in until the full sized pelele is reached Sometimes these rings are as much as two inches in size and the upper lip is fearfully stretched by wearing them It hangs away down over the lower lip and the tongue and inside of the mouth are seen when the old pelele wearer speaks The old dame is very polite but you can see that she is afraid of us and will be quite glad when we go elsewhere She says her cat is not a bit fierce but is a first rate ratter so much so that there isn t a single rat in her house Now to the next house through the bananas It is like the last and very much the same kind of things are lying about But instead of a cat we are met by the usual African yellow haired dog He too is suspicious of us but retires growling A hen is busy scraping among the rubbish at the side of the house to provide food for her numerous offspring that chirping follow her motherly cluck cluck Between this house and the last stand the grain stores round giant basket like things with thatched roofs The largest ones are for holding the maize and the small ones for storing away the beans That low building there built of very strong poles is the goat house It needs to be strong as the hy na and leopard and even the lion sometimes pay the village a visit at night And woe betide the poor goats if a fierce leopard should get in among them Not satisfied with killing and eating one he will tear open as many as he can simply for the pure love of killing The houses in the village are all much the same as that you have already read about and number about twenty They are built here there and everywhere with no regard to plan or regularity The corner of the verandah of this one projects out over the footpath and we have actually to cross the verandah to get down to the well The owner only laughs when we ask him why he built his house so near to and partly upon the path Some day he says he will hoe a new path to go round about his house That is African all over He will do things some day He thinks the European mad to be such a slave to time The owner of each house greets us with a smile and we are well received by all except some of the old people who are really afraid of white people and who while glad to see them when they come to visit their village are still more glad when they go away We have gathered quite a crowd of little people about us and they follow us round very respectfully watching all we do and looking at all we have on Many of them you see suffer from ulcers Here and there are patches of tobacco and sweet potatoes but most of the gardens are outside the village proper Their chief crops are maize millet sweet potatoes and cassava root Paths twist about and cross one another in a marvellous manner This one leads down to the stream that to the next village this to the graveyard in yonder thicket a place shunned by the children that to the hill A white stranger promptly gets lost in African paths and has to give himself up to the guidance of the native The whole country is a vast net work of such snake like paths and I verily believe you could pass from one coast to the other along them Illustration AN AFRICAN VILLAGE But just as we get to the far end of the village there is something to interest us It is a very small house well fenced in On the roof and exposed to the sun and rain are spread and tied down a blanket and various calicoes This must be the grave of someone important It is and we ask to be allowed to see inside Permission is given because it would not be polite to refuse it not because it is given willingly It proves to be the grave of the headman of the village who died about a year ago His clothes and blanket of no further use have been spread over the roof covering the grave and on the grave itself are lying his pots and baskets and drinking cups In a small dish some snuff has been placed His house which was only a few yards away had been destroyed with much ceremony after the death of the owner and the site is now heavily overgrown with castor oil plants and self sown tomatoes Not far from where his house had been is the tree at the foot of which he had offered up sacrifices to the spirits of his forefathers Being the chief of the village he was buried beside his house and not away in the bush where the common people are laid to rest I asked the children if they were not afraid of this grave in the middle of the village and they said that during the day they were not afraid because the noises of the village kept the spirits away All the time we were visiting this sacred place the old woman with the pelele was following us at a short distance not at all too pleased to see us pry into such places but too afraid to tell us so She was much relieved when our steps were turned elsewhere Such is the home of the African children Here they are born and grow up and play and laugh and cry to their heart s content It is a careless easy life with nothing beyond food and clothing to be interested in and not a thought for the morrow But we are here to give them a new interest in life In this large courtyard we gather all the people of the village together and with the western sun shining upon the little crowd we tell them of Jesus and give them something more to talk about than ourselves and our clothes Here in the quiet of this African village surrounded by the banana trees is told once more the story of the love of Jesus The old woman with the ring in her lip says our words are only white men s tales and will go on in her own way teaching the children the superstitions of her forefathers The seed we sow will not all fall on stony places Some of it will fall on good ground and bear fruit in the lives of these simple village people CHAPTER VII GAMES When black children are small the boys and girls play together but when they grow up a bit the boys separate themselves from the girls and have their own games They would never dream now of playing with the girls The latter are not strong and brave like boys and must play by themselves In this respect they are just like white boys who feel ashamed to play with girls One of the boy s greatest enjoyments is to go hunting in the woods with their bows and arrows It is small birds they want and their keen eyes scan the leafy boughs for victims of any kind It does not matter how small or pretty a bird may be down it comes struck by a heavy headed arrow Victim and arrow fall back down at the feet of the cunning shooter The reason why the boys kill even the smallest bird is that everything no matter how small will be eaten They do not eat meat as white people do All they want is just enough to make their porridge tasty and to let them have gravy So any small animal such as you would despise is acceptable to them Pushing through the bush is difficult work but the black boys do not seem to mind it although the grass towers far above their heads All they fear is that perhaps they may tread upon a snake or disturb a wild beast but in the excitement of the chase they soon forget all about snakes and wild beasts Should a boy be very good at imitating the call of birds he gets ready an arrow with many heads six or seven This he makes by splitting up one end of a thin bamboo and sharpening each piece These ends he ties in such a way as to separate them from one another leaving one in the middle He then takes his bow and his newly made arrow and goes off to the bush Having selected a likely spot he quickly pulls the grass together loosely over his head to hide him from above crouches under it and begins to imitate the call of a certain bird of which kind he sees many about In a short time the birds come hovering over the grass concealment and the boy watching his chance sends his arrow into their midst In this way several birds are obtained at a time Then the boys hunt small game such as rabbits with their dogs The dogs chase the rabbits out of the long grass and the boys stand ready to knock them over with their knobbed sticks Another favourite occupation is to go down to the gardens with hoes and dig out field mice which are relished just as much as the birds are Traps of various kinds are set to catch game Some are made with propped up stones that fall down and crush the unwary victims Some are made with a running noose that strangles the unfortunate beast A very simple kind for catching birds is made out of a long bamboo A spot is first chosen where birds are likely to gather together quickly The bamboo is then split up the middle for about a third of its length The ends which if left to themselves would spring together with a snap are held wide apart by a cross pin of wood To this pin is attached a long string which goes away over to the grass where the youthful trapper lies hidden A handful of grain is then scattered over the space between the split ends of the bamboo When everything is prepared the eager youth retires to hide in the grass and watch the birds It is not long before several are enjoying the bait and when a sufficient number have entered the boy pulls the string which displaces the cross pin and the two ends of the bamboo close together with a snap The poor birds are not all quick enough to escape and several lie dead to reward the cunning of the trapper Such doings you would hardly call games but so they are considered by the black boy for whenever I ask them to tell me what games they play at hunting and trapping are always among those given me Of games proper hand ball is a great favourite and is played in the courtyard or any other cleared space This is a kind of ball play in which two sides contend against one another for possession of the ball which is usually just a lump of raw rubber When the sides have been chosen and it matters not how many a side so long as there are plenty the game is started by a player throwing the ball to another boy on his side Thus the ball passes through the air from player to player it being the endeavour of the opposite side to intercept it and of the first lot to retain possession of it Every time the ball is caught all the players with the exception of him who holds the ball clap their hands together once and sometimes stamp with their feet The players may dodge about as they like and jump as high as they like in their endeavour to catch the ball It is an excellent game and a hard one and would be enjoyed I am sure by white boys for no lazy bones need ever think he would get the ball Only he who is quick of hand and eye would ever get a chance and the more clever the players the harder is the game After the ball has gone round one side a certain number of times the players on that side shout out a little chorus and clap their hands to proclaim their victory Then the game begins afresh and is carried on with such vigour that when finished each boy is sweating freely and glad to retire to a cool place to rest A quiet game in contrast to the hand ball is the native game of draughts in which the opponents eat one another to use the native expression Four rows of little holes are made in a shady place The opponents sit on opposite sides and each has command of two rows Sometimes there are six and at other times eight holes in each row Each player has a number of seeds or little pieces of stone or other small things about the size of marbles and he places one in each hole leaving a certain one empty Then begin mysterious movements of taking out and putting in So it seems to the European at first But there are rules and the black boys know them well The idea is to move one s own men one hole along at a time until those in any hole surpass in number those in the enemy s hole opposite when they are taken and placed out of the game The game is won when one is able to take the last remaining man on his opponent s side To the boys it is a very engrossing game and they often forget all about time over it Sometimes the holes are chiselled out on a board and the game played by the grown up people on the verandah of their houses Quite a different game from any of those described is that played by both boys and girls among the cassava bushes in the gardens When one finds a single leaf growing in a fork of a bush he calls out to his neighbour I have bound you The neighbour considers himself bound till he finds a leaf in a similar position when he calls out I have freed myself He who first finds the leaf binds the other and so the game goes on till the children are tired of it The boys have another use for the cassava leaf They pluck a nice big one Then the left hand is closed fist like but leaving a hollow in the hand The leaf is then laid across the hollow resting on the thumb and the bent fore finger The open right hand is now brought down whack upon the leaf which is split in two with a loud report Hide and seek you all know I think it must be played by children all over the world It is played by the black children of Africa and enjoyed very much There are splendid opportunities for hiding in the long grass You have only to go into it a few feet and you are completely hidden Sometimes the black children vary the game from the ordinary hide and seek The seeker will be a wild beast say a lion and the hiders will be deer They go off and hide in the grass and the lion has to find his prey Sometimes the hider will represent a deer and go and conceal himself and the seekers will be hunters on the chase Then if there is water near one will hide in the water and pretend to be a crocodile and when the others come down to the stream to bathe or draw water the crocodile rushes out on them and tries to seize them by the legs The boys also play at war with tiny bows and arrows made of grass stalks They stand in rows facing one another and try to kill one another with their arrows There is another good game played by the boys called nsikwa It has no English name or I would have written it instead of the native one There are sides in this game but two boys can play it Of course the fun is better when there are perhaps four or five a side The boys sit in the courtyard in lines facing one another and about ten feet apart In front of each player is placed a small piece of maize cob about two or three inches high from which the grain has been taken It is then very light and easily overturned In his right hand each player holds a native top When all are ready the players send their tops spinning across the clear space with great force and try to knock down the piece of maize cob belonging to the player opposite To and fro in the battle are whirled the tops to the accompaniment of shouts and laughter of opponents and onlookers Most of the games I have seen are boys games but the girls of Africa can play too like the girls of other lands But their play mostly consists of trying to do what they see their mothers do Thus the girls will seize the pestles and try to pound at the mortars Others will take the winnowing baskets and try if they can do as well as mother in sifting out the hard grains from the fine flour They also play at keeping house and marriages They borrow pots and cooking utensils from their mothers and go to the bush and build little houses and make believe to set up house on their own account If they play this game in the village the girls mark out the walls of the supposed houses with sand and say Here is my hearth there is my sleeping place and this is the doorway They also make food with mud and invite one another to afternoon mud cakes and pretending to eat them throw the mud over their shoulders When the big people of the village go to work in the gardens the children often go to the bush and build little houses and bring flour and maize and other kinds of food and play at a new village Then one will be chosen to be a hyena and another will be a cock The hyena goes off to the grass and hides and the cock struts about the village Then someone will call out It is night let us go to sleep So they all go to sleep and in a short time the cock will crow Kokoliliko which is the black boys way of saying Cock a doodle do The hyena will also roar Those in the house will awake and one will say It is daybreak but others will say It is only that foolish cock crowing in the middle of the night Then hearing the hyena one will get up open the door cautiously and chase the beast away When the big people go back to the village the children are not long in following them Boys and girls also play at funerals One will pretend to be dead and the others will gather round in sorrow and mourn over the dead one and lift him up with great ceremony and bear him off for burial But if I make this chapter any longer I am afraid I may tire you Let me finish with just one more pastime Some of the black children play at making little animals out of mud just as white boys and girls play at mud pies The African women do not bake pies so the children know nothing of the pleasures of mud pie making Instead they make little mud dogs and hens and lions and snakes These they put out into the sun where they get baked hard They can then be carried about and played with These games are some of the many played by African children and I hope you will like reading about them If you could only see the black children play them in this sunny land I am sure you would enjoy it and want to join them I have watched them often and as often wished I had a camera to take living pictures of African children at play so that you children at home might be able to see with your own eyes something of what I have but feebly tried to describe to you CHAPTER VIII FAIRY TALES All Africans are great story tellers At night round the fire when darkness covers the land and the boys appetites are appeased many are the tales told Let me translate one or two for you THE STORY OF NALING ANG A Long ago there lived a man named Naling ang a He was a very foolish man for he smoked bhang and the fumes of this deadly weed had run off with all his wisdom One day the chief of the village in which Naling ang a lived ordered all the people into his gardens to hoe for him so that the maize might not walk with the grass that it might not be overgrown All the people obeyed the chief s words and went early in the morning to the gardens followed by the chief himself But Naling ang a lingered on in the village to have a morning pipe of his favourite bhang Afterwards when all the people were already in the gardens hoeing away under the eye of the chief Naling ang a came on alone On his way he crossed over a stream and arrived at the plain near which were the chief s gardens Lying on the side of the path was an old skull that had been there for many a day and which Naling ang a had often passed But to day because he had been smoking bhang he was annoyed at it and took the handle of his hoe and struck the skull saying Tell me what killed you To his horror the skull moved and said My tongue killed me Poor Naling ang a was dreadfully afraid and his knees shook under him hearing this dead thing speak so But he plucked up courage and struck it again to see if it was really true and again the skull spoke the same words Being unable to stand it any longer for his courage at this second exhibition had deserted him he turned and fled as fast as his tottering legs could carry him to where the people were digging in the chief s gardens and lost no time in telling his story At first the people refused to believe him but because of his earnestness and his frightened condition the chief ordered all the people to stop hoeing and follow him back to the plain where he the chief would himself see this wonderful thing Arrived at the spot the people stood round about in a frightened circle with Naling ang a and the chief in the centre Naling ang a was brave now because of the crowd of people and lifting his hoe struck the poor skull a violent blow saying Tell me what killed you But the skull answered not a word Again and again he struck it and demanded it to tell but never a word spoke it The people saw now that they had been deceived and the chief was mad with rage at having been made appear foolish before the eyes of the people and at the loss of time from the hoeing So he ordered poor Naling ang a to be put to death there and then and his head to be cut off and thrown beside the skull as a warning to all to speak the truth When the execution was over and the people had all departed the skull turned round to poor Naling ang a s head and said My friend Naling ang a tell me what killed you And Naling ang a replied My tongue As with me said the skull my tongue caused a great quarrel and the people killed me THE STORY OF THE FREEMAN AND HIS SLAVES There was a freeman that had many slaves and he went with them on a journey When they were on the journey the slaves sent the freeman saying Go for water But he refused and the slaves themselves went and drew water When they returned with the water the freeman said Give me some water to drink But the slaves refused saying We don t want you to drink our water Go to the well and draw water for yourself So the freeman had to go to the well himself When he was about to drink the slaves pushed him into the water and killed him But a drop of blood leapt upwards and fell on a leaf of a tree and thereupon became a bird and sang Ku Ku Ku The slaves got ready for their journey but the bird went before them and came to the village and said They killed me Make beer when the strangers come When the slaves entered the house to drink the beer the people set fire to the house and burned them THE STORY OF THE CHILDREN AND THE SERPENT There was a certain man that hoed his garden and said Now that I have hoed my garden what shall I do These children finish the food in the garden Then he went to look for bark and made a rope out of it and put it into the garden When the children said Let us steal the rope became a serpent that drove off the children who ran to the village and said Father in the garden yonder there is a snake And he said Let us go there and see When they came to the garden the father said Look now that is a rope You thought it was a snake Is it that you were stealing the maize You must never do so again Such are African fairy tales but there is a very great difference between a written story and one told by word of mouth The teller stands up and with hands going and eyes rolling and body bending backwards and forwards imitates whatever birds or beasts their calls and their cries there are in his tale At intervals he sings out a line or two of chorus which is taken up by the audience and sung with great delight Many additions are made in the spoken tale and the written one is but the shadow of the other CHAPTER IX ANIMAL STORIES Now let me get you a few animal stories of which I am sure there must be hundreds stored up in the hearts of the black boys and girls Where they learn them I know not but they all seem to be able to tell stories I really do believe they are born with them in their hearts all ready for the telling Among the animals strange to say the rabbit is considered the cunning one White children are accustomed to hear of the sly fox who said the grapes were sour his place in Africa is taken by Mr Rabbit Many are the tricks he plays on animals big and small and even on people The foolish animal is the hyena and on him very often falls the punishment that ought to be borne by the cunning rabbit THE STORY OF THE RABBIT AND THE ELEPHANT A rabbit made friends with an elephant and they agreed together to hoe a large garden While they were busy hoeing the head of the rabbit s hoe fell out and as he could not see a stone on which to knock his hoe he was at a loss to know what to do Suddenly a good plan entered his head and turning to the elephant he said Friend Elephant let me knock in my hoe on your head The elephant agreed and the hoe was knocked in by the rabbit Then they went on hoeing again Not long after the head of the elephant s hoe fell off So turning to the rabbit he said Friend Rabbit let me knock in my hoe on your head But the rabbit being afraid that the elephant would kill him refused and ran off On his way he met a hyena who asked him why he was running at such a break neck speed Ah replied the rabbit the elephant has much meat in the garden yonder Go to him and you will be sure to get a bit I am running to get a knife to cut it up When the elephant saw the hyena coming he thought it was still the rabbit who had bewitched himself to be like another beast So he caught him and killed him THE STORY OF THE RABBIT AND THE HIPPOPOTAMUS A rabbit going down to the river to drink met a hippopotamus and began to speak to him Not far away was an elephant feeding on the trees near the bank of the river Come let us try our strength said the rabbit to the hippopotamus you try to pull me into the water and I shall try to pull you to the bank and whoever is pulled over must pay the other But the hippopotamus would not listen to such a proposal and laughed saying Why should I waste time pulling with a creature so small as you But the rabbit urged him very much to have a try so at last he consented Then the rabbit went off to find a rope but in passing the elephant who was feeding quietly he challenged him to a similar trial of strength but this time the rabbit was to try to pull the elephant into the water Like the hippopotamus the elephant at first refused But in the end he consented So the rabbit gave him one end of the rope saying that he would go down into the water and begin to pull When he reached the river however he gave the other end of the rope to the hippopotamus saying he would now run back and begin to pull Then the rabbit pretending to go to pull his end of the rope slyly lay down in the grass and watched Then the two great animals began to pull and tug against one another but neither could pull the other over and all the time the rabbit lay laughing in the grass All day the great beasts heaved and tugged at the rope About sunset quite worn out they gave up the tug of war The rabbit ran to the river bank where the hippopotamus was standing exhausted half out of the water with the sand all trampled round about Well said the rabbit how did I pull The poor hippopotamus had to own up that he was beaten and agreed to pay Thereupon the rabbit ran to where the elephant still panted amidst trampled grass and brushwood and said Well how did I pull The elephant also had to own defeat and agreed to pay Thus was the rabbit made rich in a single day THE STORY OF THE RABBIT AND THE LION CUBS A rabbit once wanted to wear a lion s skin so he said Where shall I find one But his friends said You don t mean it The lion is a fearful animal But the rabbit said I shall deceive it So he went to a lion s den where there were cubs stood in the courtyard and clapped his hands The lioness came out and received his salutation and said Well what And the rabbit replied I have come to stay So the lioness said Pass into the house there and take care of the children Remain with them and I myself shall go to kill game Then she went away to kill game Not long afterwards the lioness came back and stood in the path and called out saying Rabbit And the rabbit said Here I am And she said Take this meat Are all the children well And the rabbit replied Yes they are all well All right said the lioness bring them that I may see them So the rabbit brought them and said This is one this is another and this another In all there were three Quite pleased the lioness said Take the meat and give it them The rabbit went and received the meat but ate it all himself and the children got none Then the lioness went off to kill more meat When she had gone the rabbit took one child killed it took off its skin and went away to hide it The lioness soon returned bringing more game and said Are the children well Bring them that I may see them So the rabbit brought them saying This is one this is another and this another but one he brought twice Again well pleased the lioness went away for more game and the rabbit killed another cub took off its skin and went away and hid it In the evening the lioness again returned bringing meat and said Are the children all well As usual the rabbit replied Yes they are all well So he showed the lioness the same cub three times and said This is one this is another and this another Again well pleased the lioness said Take this meat and give it them But the rabbit ate it all and afterwards killed the cub that was left skinned it and went off to hide the skin Then afraid of the return of the lioness he went to get string Next he cut a small slave stick and tied himself by the neck Then he twisted cords and tied his legs and bound himself to the stick again and with another cord tied his arms Then he made a great noise and called out War War War against the lion War The lioness came bounding back and said What is the matter So the rabbit said The children are all taken the soldiers carried them off And the lioness demanded Soldiers from where And the rabbit said I don t know Untie me The lioness set about untying and the rabbit said Wait for me I shall go in search of them So the rabbit went away and found monkeys spinning their tops saying Go Go But the rabbit said Yes nonsense but you should say I have killed a lion and taken off his skin The monkeys said Yes very good and the rabbit left the monkeys repeating these words He himself went back and met the lioness and said The children were killed by these monkeys So the lioness said Deceive them saying that we will do trade in tops So the rabbit went back to the monkeys and said Let us deal in these tops So they said With what goods And the rabbit said With beans Then the monkeys said Well bring them that we may buy So the rabbit went back and told all to the lioness who said Weave a basket and tie me into it And the rabbit wove a basket tied in the lioness and put a few beans on top lifted the basket and departed When he arrived at their courtyard he found the monkeys spinning their tops So he called out I have brought that merchandise And they replied We shall buy it Just then a monkey sent his top spinning saying I have killed a lion s cub and have taken off its skin So the rabbit whispered to the lioness Listen those fellows killed the children then to the monkeys Let us go and sell in this house Then the rabbit took a knife and cut the ropes that held the lioness who sprang out upon the poor monkeys and killed them all But the rabbit went for his skins and took them home and wore them THE STORY OF THE TORTOISE AND THE MONKEY Once a tortoise and a monkey made friends and the monkey said to the tortoise Friend Tortoise come to my home and visit So the tortoise went and the monkey cooked food for him but wishing to play a trick on him placed it on a high platform which the tortoise could not possibly reach up to Then he called the tortoise saying Friend Tortoise go into the house and eat When the tortoise went in expecting a feast he found the food so high up that he could not reach it So he came out very angry and said Friend Monkey you have been insolent to me So he went home and brooded over the insult for three days Then he sent a messenger to invite the monkey to his home saying to himself Yon monkey was cheeky to me I also will be cheeky to him So when the monkey came he found food already cooked and eyed it greedily But the tortoise said Friend Monkey there is no water in the house go down to the stream and wash your hands So the monkey went down through the burned grass and washed his hands in anticipation of the feast But in coming back from the stream he had to pass again through the burned grass and his hands were as black as ever So seeing through the tortoise s cunning he got angry and said My friend has played a trick on me and departed to his own home CHAPTER X FINGER RHYMES AND RIDDLES Now I have told you four African tales of animals and perhaps you are tired of such stories If however I can remember a very good one before I am finished writing to you I shall put it into this chapter Let me now tell you about the black boys and girls riddles and there are one or two nursery rhymes that I know of I am sure you would like to hear them so I shall write them down for you as they are spoken here and then translate them for you Here is one of them Uyu ndi mtecheteche Uyu ndi mpwache wa mteche Uyu ndi mkala pakati Uyu ndi mkomba mbale Uyu ndi chitsiru chache Tikumenya iwe Go Go Can you guess what this is all about You have a rhyme that means just the same Well this is what these funny words mean This is the shaky little finger This is his younger brother This is the one in the middle This is the plate scraper This is an old fool I beat you thus Go Go It is you see an African finger rhyme You have all one of your own but I am sure in it you never call your fore finger a plate scraper nor your thumb an old fool But if you had to eat without spoons and knives and forks and wanted to make your plate very clean you would have to use your fore finger a good deal and you would then understand why the black children call it a plate scraper This is another finger rhyme for counting up all the fingers Mbewa zagwa Zagweranji Zagwera mapira Ndikazikumbe Ndiopa uluma Mzanga Likongwa Ali kukaku Amanga mpanda Ndikamtandize Wata Kale This is the English for it The mice have fallen Why have they fallen They have fallen for the millet I go dig them I fear to be bitten My friend Mr Weasel He is at the chiefs house He builds a fence I go help him He s finished long ago Then about guesses I have tried to pick out one or two just to let you hear what like they are Many of the answers to riddles I have heard seemed to me to have little or no point in them So it is with the stories But when I have failed to see the joke and have not laughed the black boys have not failed They have their own funny stories and laugh at them heartily But our jokes they do not understand nor do they play pranks on one another as white boys do Let me try to tell you how you can make black boys and girls roar with laughter and yet to a white man there is nothing to laugh about If you are telling them about people scattering helter skelter and say that the people nalimenya which means go off helter skelter the boys will go into fits of laughter Now I can see nothing to laugh at in this and I am sure you can t either and if another word had been used neither would the black boy But here is the peculiar thing It is the li in the middle of the word that makes it funny to African children here Menya means beat but li menya means run off helter skelter Again Sesa means sweep but li sesa means run off helter skelter and so on with a lot of other words the addition of the syllable li makes them change their meanings entirely and become run off helter skelter and so very funny that black boys and girls cannot keep from laughing Now for the guesses What is yonder and here at the same time Answer A shadow I built a house with one post Answer A mushroom It goes yonder yet remains here Answer A belt I had a big garden yet got no food from it Answer The hair of the head I built my house without any door Answer An egg My hen laid an egg among thorns Answer The tongue and the teeth I think you will understand these answers to the above guesses but what do you think of this one In my mother s house there is money Answer Baldness I am certain you and I would never have thought of such an answer Here are one or two of their proverbs Sleep knows no friendship has no favourite If your neighbour s beard takes fire quench it which latter means Help your neighbour now for some day you may need help By means of these guesses the African children while away the time and amuse themselves on wet days or on cold nights round the fire by asking them from one another Now let me close this chapter by telling you the story of THE RABBIT THE LION AND THE WILD PIG There was once a lion that knew all about medicine He did a good trade with people who came to buy it One day some people from a far country came and begged him to come with them to heal their sick So the lion agreed and set about to get a servant to carry his bundle on the journey Finding a wild pig near he called him saying Come friend Pig will you go on that journey and the pig agreed So the lion gave him the load to carry When they were on the way the lion said to the pig Look there Master Pig that is the medicine for porridge If they make porridge for us at the end of our journey you must run and get some of these leaves The pig said All right and they went on their journey While they were passing another bush the lion said again Look there Master Pig that is the medicine for rice If they make rice you must run and get some of these leaves The pig again said All right and they continued their journey When they reached the village of the sick people the lion and pig were well received In the evening porridge was cooked for them and the lion said to the pig Master Pig go and get yon leaves So Master Pig ran off to get the leaves When he came back with them he found that the lion had finished all the porridge So that night Master Pig went to bed hungry Next evening the people cooked rice and the lion said to the pig Master Pig go and get yon leaves and Master Pig set off in a hurry to bring the leaves But when he got back all puffing and blowing he found that the lion had just finished the rice and he had to go hungry to bed Next day they returned home and the poor pig arrived at his village in a famished condition to the great sorrow of his wife and children Not long afterwards other people came requesting the services of Dr Lion to heal their sick and he agreed to go Looking around for a carrier he spied the rabbit and said Come friend Rabbit will you go on that journey and the rabbit agreed So the lion gave him his load to carry When they were on the way the lion said to the rabbit Master Rabbit do you see that bush That is the medicine for porridge If they make porridge for us at the village you must run and get these leaves All right said the rabbit and they continued their journey But they had not gone far when the rabbit stopped and said Where is my knife I must have left it where we rested Let me run back to get it All right said the lion don t be long So the rabbit ran back pulled some leaves from the medicine bush and hid them in the load When he reached the lion they resumed their journey Soon the lion stopped again at another bush and said Master Rabbit do you see that bush That is medicine for rice If they cook rice for us at the village you must run and get these leaves The rabbit said All right and they went on their way But in a short time the rabbit stopped and said Where is my knife I must have left it where we rested Let me run back for it The lion was very angry this time and said What kind of a servant are you always losing your knife Don t be long So the rabbit ran back not to find his knife but to pull the medicine leaves for rice which he hid in his bundle When he made up on the lion again they continued their journey and soon arrived at the village In the evening porridge was cooked for the visitors and the lion said to the rabbit Master Rabbit go and get yon leaves So the rabbit untied his bundle and produced the leaves The lion was so angry at seeing the leaves thus produced that he could not eat a bite and the rabbit had all the porridge to himself Next evening rice was cooked for them and the lion said to the rabbit Master Rabbit go for yon leaves But the rabbit again just opened his load and produced the leaves and the lion was so sick and angry that he could not touch the rice which the rabbit ate all to himself Next day they started on their homeward journey and the first night slept in the same house the lion in a bed the rabbit on a piece of bark During the night the rabbit said out aloud He who sleeps on bark will be fresh for his journey in the morning but he who sleeps in a bed will walk heavily and with pain The lion on hearing this got out of bed saying You little one get off that bark I myself will sleep there So they changed sleeping places In the middle of the night the rabbit got up and lit a fire while the lion slept The heat of the fire soon caused the bark to shrivel up and tightly enclose the sleeping giant Then the rabbit ran off home and left him In the morning great roars were heard coming from the house and the people wondering what had befallen Dr Lion rushed in and found him struggling to free himself With their axes they soon had him out and he went home a hungry and sorrowful beast When his wife and children saw him looking so thin they set up a great crying And so people who believe that they are very clever will soon find others more clever than they The lion thought himself very cunning when he deceived the poor pig but he found the rabbit too much for him CHAPTER XI FOOD AND ORNAMENTS The principal dish of the African is a kind of maize porridge made rather thick so as to hold together in lumps It is for flour to make this porridge that the women are continually pounding at the mortars The porridge is always eaten with something tasty to send it down and is never eaten without this relish Now this relish may be simply juicy leaves got in the bush and boiled as we boil cabbage or it may be meat of some kind no matter what or it may be fish no matter how high but it is oftenest beans porridge and beans being the everyday food African children have but two regular meals in the day and the porridge one is the afternoon meal The forenoon one may be made of sweet potatoes or green maize or pumpkins or cucumbers anything that does not require much cooking on the part of the mothers But from early morning onwards the children always have an eye for anything that will help to appease their hunger Thus the boys go off early with their bows and arrows to shoot birds or they may go digging for field mice or setting traps for any small kind of animal that may be foolish enough to enter them These little creatures are skinned and roasted spitted on bamboos and kept ready for porridge time At certain seasons of the year a kind of caterpillar is gathered to be roasted to make relish I have seen children with their hands full of yellow green crawling things as proud as if they had been a handful of sweets Then when the sky is dark with locusts the children are glad Knowing the locusts cannot fly till the sun has warmed them the boys and girls go out early in the morning and gather baskets full of them The legs and wings are torn off and the bodies roasted Then again at the time when the winged white ants are issuing forth from underground to fly off and make another home the cunning children place a pot over the hole and catch hundreds These also they roast and consider delicious Their sweets are very few wild honey and sugar cane They do like sugar cane and tear it and munch it with their strong white teeth It is very sweet and not unpleasant to chew But a white man must get it cut into little bits for him before he can enjoy it He cannot eat it as the black people do Some of the tribes eat frogs and snakes and land crabs and snails but many of them do not Those who do not eat such things look down upon those who do and consider them savages and altogether to be despised Then again in every tribe there are certain superstitious customs as regards food A mother will warn her child saying My child you must never eat rabbit If you eat rabbit your body will be covered with sores So this child will refrain from rabbit and so on with other kinds of meat each child has something or other that is forbidden to him I remember once when some boys of mine had gone rabbit hunting asking a very small boy who had been left behind if he was looking forward to the feast that was to come when the other boys returned and how he would enjoy rabbit I don t eat rabbit he replied in a disconsolate voice I asked him why Does not everyone even the white man eat rabbit Yes he replied but my mother forbade me to eat rabbit saying if I did I would be covered with itch I advised him to try but he was afraid Later on in the day towards sunset after the boys had returned from the woods I saw the little disconsolate one all smiles He was holding in his hand two miserable field mice and was as happy as a king The other boys had remembered he did not eat rabbit and had put off half an hour to capture some mice for him that he might be able to join in the feast Besides the food from the gardens there are many bush fruits that the African children eat So as far as food is concerned the black boys and girls are very well off They have none of the pleasant things you may buy with your pennies But then they know nothing of your nice things and so they do not feel the want of them Give the African child bananas and sugar cane and ground nuts what you call monkey nuts I think and he is as happy as you with your toffy and chocolate and other sweets When a black boy or girl gets up in the morning he or she has just a small wash The real wash comes later on in the day when it is warmer But they are very particular over their teeth and take very good care of them In keeping them clean they use toothbrushes which they make out of little pieces of the wood of a certain tree about the length of a lead pencil but rather shorter and stouter One end is cut and cut into again and again and teased out till it makes a very good toothbrush and with it the black boy keeps his teeth in good condition Of course it must be easy for him because he can open his mouth so very wide At the real washing he goes down to a quiet pool and has good fun in the water with his companions I have often come across little groups of them and of course when a white man comes along the children squat down doubled up to try to hide their nakedness making themselves just like a group of brown giant frogs Their feet they clean with broken pieces of rock and would you believe it the soles of their feet and the palms of their hands are white It is strange but so it is Their feet too are very large and strong compared with ours but their hands are generally very neat and shapely On these feet they can walk mile after mile and not feel tired If a small white boy walked five miles on a journey and five miles back he would boast of his endurance But it is a common thing for a small black boy to walk twenty and even thirty miles in a single day and think nothing about it In fact if he could not do it he would consider himself a weakling Of course in cold weather the children do not wash at all and in some places when the grown up people are not particular the children wash but seldom But on the whole they like to be clean especially after having come into contact with white men for most white men insist on the black children keeping themselves clean Illustration A BATHING POOL If you had a black woolly head like those of the African children how would you do your hair You would find all your brushes useless and your combs would break on the first trial They would not be nearly strong enough to get through the mass of short curls Have the black children no combs then Oh yes peculiar combs they make the teeth of which point out like fingers and with these they comb their woolly pates But it is in arranging their hair that they excel One boy will train a tuft of hair over his forehead to grow up like a horn Another will think he ought to shave out bald spaces Some cut the hair on both sides and leave a ridge in the middle like a cock s comb while others tie the hair with grasses into little tufts and make their heads like miniature cabbage gardens And after a death in the family the hair is shaved clean off altogether and the black boy appears with a head like an ostrich egg Feathers and sometimes flowers are stuck into the hair as decorations Teeth too come in for some attention They are not always allowed to grow as nature wills In some of the tribes the boys and girls teeth are filed by their mothers each tribe having its own peculiar way of filing Sometimes all the teeth are cut into little notches Sometimes only the two upper front ones are done But the custom is dying out and many of the children of the present generation are not made to submit to such an indignity Tattooing is also practised by many tribes Face arms breast and back are often done Again difference of tribes is shown by these markings This is how it is performed The cuts are first made and allowed a day or two to heal partly They are then opened up again and charcoal rubbed in The wounds are then allowed to heal which they do as broad black raised up lines These tatoo marks are quite different from what is seen on some white people at home They are not drawings but simply little lines some straight some curved done into a certain tribal design In some tribes the ears are pierced and the hole made rather large So large are they in some cases that I have seen a native carry a roasted mouse hanging through his ear I have already told you about the ring in the upper lip called the pelele so I shall not mention it again But some of the women who have given up the pelele have taken to wearing a button of lead in one side of the nose which from our point of view does not improve their appearance Their persons they adorn with anklets and bracelets of brass But in places where there are plenty of elephants one finds the girls wearing great ivory bracelets made from the tusks All kinds of grass bracelets are plaited and worn by young girls who can t afford to have better ones and I have sometimes seen a necklace made by stringing parts of locust s legs and beads together Of the beads there is an infinite variety bought from the trader These are strung together in many ways and made into bracelets and necklaces and various other things which only the patience of African children could produce CHAPTER XII THE AFRICAN S BELIEF In this chapter we shall tell about something altogether different from what you have been reading We shall go into the spirit land of the African children and we shall try to find out something of what they believe about God In the great black part of Africa there are no temples and wonderful gods to write about There are no old books to be found containing the wisdom of their forefathers written down and preserved through long ages In fact there is not very much in native African belief that can be made very interesting to white boys and girls But I shall try to do my best to let you understand something about it Some people at home think that the heathen tribes of Africa know nothing at all about God But it is not so They do know something be it only a very very little In some tribes it is so very little as to be almost nothing and shows us how far they have fallen away from a knowledge of their Creator Let me tell you what some of the tribes here believe about God God our loving heavenly Father is to them but a far away spirit whom they call the old old one or the great great one He made the world and everything in it and sends rain and sunshine and is all powerful But He is very far away from us and takes little interest in the people of the earth When people die their spirits they say go to the land of this old old one Spirit villages are there I have heard it said inhabited by the spirit folk As a man was on earth so is he in the land of the spirits So a chief on earth remains a chief in spirit land Now the spirits of the chiefs are supposed to be on very intimate terms with the old old one and are allowed to do almost whatever they like with the affairs of the people on earth So it is the spirit of the dead chief that receives the sacrifices and prayers of the people The old old one is felt to be so far away and so indifferent that he is passed over in some tribes forgotten altogether and the spirit of the chief receives the homage due to the great great one because the people feel that he the chief has a personal interest in them The more famous generally the more fierce a chief was on earth in his life time the more is his help asked for after he is dead and has gone to the land of the spirits It is not considered wise to neglect him in case he revenge himself upon the people The spirits of the common people are just ordinary inhabitants of spirit land and are of no account except to their near relatives A man in private matters of his own may seek the aid of the spirit of his father or of his grandfather But on the whole it is the spirit of the chief whom the people knew and were familiar with that is prayed to and receives the sacrifices of the people The spirits when they wish to speak to the people may enter into any person and cause that person to rave like a madman He retires to the darkness of a hut while his fit of madness lasts His sayings are not set aside as mere idle words but are remembered and repeated to the interpreter generally an old person who explains to the people that under cover of these words spoken in delirium by the person possessed the spirits mean that so and so should be done Dreams also are thought of as journeyings to the land of the spirits Now I think that will be enough about the spirits for you to understand a little of what many of the African children believe about the Great Spirit who made everything It is only when the children are big that they are told all these things about the spirits The people do not like to talk about such things and the children avoid the places where the spirits are supposed to come and visit They are afraid to give offence to the spirits I think and in fact all their sacrifices seem to be made with the idea of appeasing the anger and earning the good will of the spirits Sometimes the sacrifices are made at the base of a tree Very often a small hut is built in which sacrifice is offered up The offerings are of flour or native beer and at other times of animals Only small bits of the flesh of the sacrificed animal are offered the rest of the meat being eaten by the people The bits offered up are wrapped in leaves and placed at the root of the sacrificial tree It is the chief who offers up the sacrifice and says the prayers In times of great calamity large sacrifices are held in which several chiefs join their people together and make prayer to the departed ones Sacrifices are also made for rain for success in hunting for safety in travelling and for freedom from sickness The prayers are generally very simple requests like the following one for safety Watch over me my forefather who died long ago and tell the great spirit at the head of my race from whom came my mother Here is a short account of a sacrifice for rain The chief goes to the spirit hut to offer sacrifice for rain and the people stand round about having brought the meat for the sacrifice Then the chief begins to complain to the spirits saying Give us rain and do not harden your heart against us With many other prayers he continues to implore while the people round about clap their hands and some of the women sing Kokwe Kolole Kokwe Kolole Mbvula ya kuno sikudza Kokwe Kolole which means May there come rain sweeping rain The rain here has not come May there come rain sweeping rain When the rain does come the people believe that it came because they appeased the anger of the great great one with their sacrifice But wherever the Gospel of Jesus is preached the people are learning that there has been offered up for them by God Himself one great sacrifice which has redeemed the fallen sons of men the sacrifice of His only Son on Calvary s Cross CHAPTER XIII THE AFRICAN IN SICKNESS When the children of Africa are well and strong their lives are carelessly happy so long as they are not hungry When they are ill all the happiness departs and they become very miserable You may have thought that because black children can eat almost anything that they are never ill But that is not so They suffer I believe a good deal more than white children do For simple troubles they get no treatment at all They are just ill they say and lie on their mats near the fire or sit huddled up over it until they are better These little complaints are mostly all of the stomachache kind caused by reckless eating of anything the children can pick up I have seen black children eat fruit that was quite green and hard such as would kill little whites and still live And when you try to explain that these things can hurt they just smile to themselves and go on swallowing them for they don t believe you Headaches are treated by binding the head round the temples tightly with a piece of string Sometimes if the headache is very painful the sufferer is bled Little cuts are made on the throbbing temples with a sharp knife and the blood allowed to flow It is the mothers who are the doctors and nurses of the children Very often the sick child is attended by his grandmother These old ladies are supposed to know a great deal about medicine and they do know many plants and roots that are useful in simple illnesses For mumps which many black children call masigwidi no medicine is given The mothers tell the children to go to the mortar put their heads in and call Mooo I don t know whether this simple remedy is a certain cure or not The following method of getting rid of the disease is considered to be very effective The person sick with masigwidi goes in the evening to the house of another person and claps his hands in salutation When the inmates reply the owner of the house takes mumps and the former sick one runs off cured When a child is seriously ill the doctor is called in as is the case with white children The disease has gone beyond the skill of the mothers and grandmothers so better advice must be got The doctor when he comes is first of all paid a fee A few fowls are caught and handed over to him Then he begins to treat the sufferer He keeps his medicine in horns not having any bottles And in these horns are many weird mixtures Like the grandmothers most of his medicine is made from plants and roots yet it is wonderful how well they get on with these simple things When the patient recovers another fee is charged by the doctor But if the child dies unless if be from some well known disease like smallpox death may be attributed to witchcraft Someone has used bad magic against the patient and nothing could save him In the presence of serious trouble however these doctors are very helpless and when accidents have happened and bones are broken and internal injuries are inflicted the sufferers are beyond their aid Here then is the opportunity for the medical missionary from the home land He is able again and again to help the people when they are most helpless Thus he gains their confidence and a way to their hearts for the Gospel of Christ His work is a daily putting into practice of the teaching of Our Saviour and the lesson learned from it is not lost on the African African children suffer a great deal from ulcers especially on their legs These are painful sores that break out on them and if neglected as they are alas too often there is grave danger to the limb Sores on the toes are common You may see in almost any village children running about with some of their toes half eaten away These sores are caused by an insect the penetrating flea or jigger which bores its way under the skin and seeks in the warm flesh a cosy place to bring forth its young It generally selects a place under the toe nail as most suitable When it enters first the jigger is very small But in a few days it grows big and may become the size of a small pea If these pests are not promptly removed sores break out on the toes and the toes crumble away Now little children are unable to take them out and if their mothers neglect to do so the children lose their toes I have often seen boys armed with stout thorns picking the jiggers out of one another s feet The process I know from experience is sometimes painful for the toe under the nail is very tender yet the black children seldom wince when the jiggers are being taken out They are brave little things in the presence of physical pain but they really do not feel so keenly as you children do Their feelings are a good deal blunter than yours and so they do not dread pain as much as you do for they suffer less There are some diseases found among African children that are not found among white children Of these leprosy the most dreadful used long ago to afflict white children too It is the terrible disease from which our tender hearted Saviour freed some poor sufferers when He was on earth Alas one comes across it now and again among the black races of Africa I remember once meeting a leper He was a bright lad and was attending a class for Bible instruction Some of the joints of his fingers were gone at the time I saw him but he had been a leper for some years then He told me that his father had been a leper and that he himself began to suffer from leprosy when he was a boy of some twelve years of age The beginning was like this One morning he awoke and felt his hands and arms sore as if they had been burned in spots here and there during the night So he blamed the other boys who slept in the hut for playing tricks on him with a burning stick But they all denied it It was the beginning of the fatal disease The Africans have no treatment for the leper He simply lives his life in the village so long as he looks after himself or can get anyone to care for him But when his disease has gone on year after year and he is no longer able to walk or do anything for himself or has no friend to care for him the people used to have and still have in many places a savage way of dealing with him Back from the village a bit in the bush a little hut was built and one day the leper was carried out taken to the hut shut into it with a supply of food and left to his fate Either he perished from hunger or was devoured by a wild beast or was burned to death by a bush fire The natives firmly believe that such lepers are transformed into wild animals I once heard how a poor sufferer was otherwise dealt with He had been ill for years with an ulcer on one of his legs The sore had been neglected at first and then it got too bad for treatment But as native doctors cannot cut off limbs as white doctors can the poor fellow could now do nothing but lie about his village and depend on his friends to help him As he got worse and worse and less able to help himself his friends became fewer and fewer At last he became such a source of trouble to the people that the men decided to put an end to it Accordingly they went up the hillside near and dug a grave with a small niche to one side at the bottom Then they returned to the village and carried off the helpless sufferer He guessed at their intention and piteously implored them to desist Where are you going with me he said Do not leave me alone on the cold hillside But they were deaf to his appeals When they reached the grave they quickly lowered the miserable wretch down placed him in the niche at the side shut him in with a mat drove in a few stakes filled up the grave and left him Not long ago I passed through a village where some years ago I had made the acquaintance of the head man He was then a hale and hearty old fellow fond of his joke and his snuff box But now what a change I found his people mostly gone and he himself but the wreck of what he had been Everything round about had a neglected look Some disease or other had laid him low and friends had gone I found him sitting on a mat close to a fire His poor skeleton legs were firmly bound at knees and ankles with cords made of bark He had tried many doctors he said and had paid for much medicine and now he had nothing to do but sit and wait for the end He was too old to visit a white doctor he was accustomed to the medicine of his own people and would not try that of strangers There is a great deal of suffering in African villages silently and patiently borne and the white doctor can do a great deal to alleviate it I can assure you children that your pennies put into the missionary box to help to support hospitals in heathen lands are not given in vain and there is no part of missionary work that more deserves your help Remember what our Lord said Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto Me CHAPTER XIV MAGIC MEDICINE In the previous chapter we were talking about doctors and medicine In this chapter we shall hear more about medicine but of another kind Medicine in Africa is of two kinds one for the lawful purpose of healing the sick the other for the unlawful purpose of bewitching people and doing other dark deeds It is when we begin to look into all that surrounds this unlawful medicine that we meet the heathen in his darkness The black people firmly believe in the power of medicines to bewitch to enable the possessor to steal or to do some other thing equally bad Anything that happens for which they cannot account they ascribe to witchcraft medicine The white people are supposed to be the possessors of great stores of such medicine and from that to obtain their power This belief crops up on all sides in their daily life for there are unlawful medicines for almost everything All one requires to know is where to find a dealer in such medicine and he will make it to your order no matter what you may want it for He will give you medicine to bury against your enemy that he may die or he will make you medicine that will enable you to kill game easily Everything can be done by the power of medicine The darkest part of this belief in medicines is that in which certain people are supposed to possess power to cause the death of others that they may feast upon their dead bodies Such horrible people are called Afiti in this part of Africa They are supposed through their medicine to have powers of making themselves invisible at will of going great distances in the smallest interval of time of changing themselves into beasts etc These Afiti are supposed to gather during the night round the grave of any recently buried person to call the dead man out and to feast upon him The bark of a fox or the hoot of an owl at night is said to be the signal call for these wretches to assemble for their awful meal When a mysterious death has happened in a village it is at once blamed upon one of the Afiti But who he is nobody can tell It may be one s very own father for the Afiti during the day retain their ordinary form one never can tell Great fear hangs over the village for each suspects his neighbour of being the cause of the death Then the witch finder is sent for He or she for sometimes the witch finder is a woman comes laden with medicines and charms and stays in the village No one now will be seen out of doors after dark in case of being suspected After learning all the gossip of the village and finding out who was on bad terms with the dead man the witch finder proceeds to business The people are assembled to the sound of a large drum and stand in a circle in fear and trembling The witch finder now begins to dance and spin round and work himself up to a high pitch of excitement during which he rushes here and there among the frightened people smells their hands for traces of blood and finally calls out the name of the guilty person Then the poison ordeal is tried A poison draught is made up with bark from a certain tree and the accused is given it to drink Should he happen to vomit it up again after having taken it he is declared to be innocent and payment is made to him But should he happen to die what further proof was necessary The village is now clear of the evil one and great rejoicings are made and payment given to the witch finder In this way hundreds and thousands of innocent people have met their end in Darkest Africa This belief in Afiti is one of the most difficult to deal with which the missionary encounters You try to explain that God never gave people such power over one another but although agreeing with you outwardly they secretly cling to the old belief and their faith in the poison cup for there are among them people foolish enough to imagine themselves possessed of Afiti powers who actually open graves and steal bits especially fingers from the dead It is the occurrence of such cases that causes the people to cling to their belief Among the negro peoples the makers of medicine are supposed to have power over the spirits and to bind them into what are called fetiches A fetich may consist of any convenient sized object It may be a small horn or a snail s shell or a stone But it has power only when the witch doctor has imprisoned a spirit in it This he does of course for payment And fetiches are made to meet every wish of the human heart You can obtain them to make you brave or wise or cunning or to prevail over your enemy or to prevent theft or to be successful in the chase or anything you wish In this part of Africa when a lion begins to prey upon human beings he is supposed to be one of the Afiti who to satisfy his craving for human flesh has transformed himself into a lion for the time being At a certain village on the river Shir several people had been taken by a large crocodile which was well known because of its boldness This animal was believed not to be a real crocodile by the people of the village but to be one of the Afiti transformed After the brute had taken off several people one of the men of the village determined to put an end to the tragedies Seizing a spear he boldly went into the water to try conclusions with the monster But he too in spite of his medicine was taken off and only a reddish tinge on the water marked the spot where he had been seized and dragged down Quite recently I asked a boy to go an errand for me His destination was about fifteen miles away and he could not possibly arrive before dark But the road was perfectly safe or I would not have asked him to go At first he did not want to go declaring he was sure Afiti would catch him whenever it became dark If a fire is seen in the distance where no fire should be it is at once put down to the presence of the dreaded corpse eaters I remember another boy who not long ago insisted in maintaining that one night an Mfiti had come and sat on his chest for a long time while he remained in mortal terror lest it should begin to tear him Explanations of nightmare were of no avail The boy firmly believes to this day that he had a narrow escape from being devoured Some years ago I remember seeing a medicine man surrounded by a crowd of natives He was telling them that he had medicine to protect him from being hit by any stone that might be thrown at him His word was just accepted and no native ever thought of lifting a stone to try When a white man offered to have a throw at him he objected saying that his medicine had power over black people only Another man I can recall produced a horn containing a very powerful medicine that enabled the possessor to enter unseen into any house by simply stepping through the wall He was asked to display its powers on the white man s house He also declined saying that his medicine was made against black men s houses only which are made of grass and not against white men s that are built of brick What a magnificent faith these poor black people have in their magic medicine If it fails it fails only because someone is working against them with more powerful medicine still and a new supply must be got The belief in the medicine remains as strong as ever If this unwavering faith could only be transformed in a single day to Him who is the Light of the World what a change would come over the Dark Continent CHAPTER XV THE DANCE AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS Now I am sure you have learned a great deal about the African people and their children yet there are two important things I have not written about and these are their dances and their musical instruments I had intended to put this part into the chapter on games but I thought I had better not although the dance is considered a game by the African children In the hot season when the moon is full the whole country side resounds with the beating of drums and the shrill voices of the dancers are borne far on the warm night wind There are many kinds of drums from the deep bass to the high tenor They are beaten with the hands and on a still night the deep boom of the bass drum can be heard for miles interrupted by the short snap of the smaller ones The time seems at first very irregular and for a white man difficult to follow But the dancers move out and in and round about and keep up the game till sunrise Unfortunately the dances are not all harmless ones and the less said about some of them the better Of musical instruments the African children have quite a large number One of their favourites is called a Sese I can best describe it to you by calling it an African mandoline The body is made out of a large dry gourd and the strings are made by twisting threads together till the desired thickness and strength is obtained The left hand fingers are used for pressing down the strings which are tweeked by the fingers of the right hand The music is very pleasing when the Sese player is a short distance off The tunes are quite unlike anything white children hear at home and charm one by their quaintness I have tried to play the instrument but of course failed The boys themselves are not all able to play the Sese Only those who are musical can and after much patient practice Another instrument with which the boys amuse themselves is called the Sansi It is the African piano and is played a great deal by river boys The sounding board in the Sansi is made out of a flat piece of wood about six or seven inches square and about an inch deep hollowed out Two rows of little keys are fixed along this board The keys are sometimes made of wood but in good instruments are of iron These keys are all different sizes and are arranged so as to produce a kind of a scale pleasing to the African ear and not unpleasant to us The instrument is grasped in both hands and the keys are skilfully played by the thumbs and forefingers of both hands Sometimes these instruments are bedecked with beads and pieces of shells which cause a sort of buzzing accompaniment to the music A good deal of skill is necessary to play the Sansi properly and it is only a boy here and there who can do it well Like the Sese the Sansi sounds more pleasant when a bit away The flute is another source of amusement to the African boy He makes his own instrument out of a piece of reed but he can appreciate a good tin whistle from across the sea From the reed he takes the pith and bores three or four holes in the hollow tube and his flute is ready The notes produced from the native flute always seem to me to be of a weird melancholy nature The same three or four notes are blown over and over again and become in time rather monotonous to the white man Illustration DRILL REPLACES THE DANCE Then there is the African violin called the mgoli It consists of a drum through which sticks are passed There is one string drawn tight over a bridge which stands in the drum This primitive fiddle is played with a bow It is not so difficult to play as the others already described but its music is much more monotonous The African boys are also expert at playing on a wooden dulcimer which they call Nangolingondo Pieces of hard wood tuned to the African scale are laid across two pieces of palm stem and are fixed in their places by pegs Then two players squat down on opposite sides of the dulcimer armed with a stick in each hand One player leads off with a few flourishes and is joined by the other player whose notes overlap and yet fit into and between those of the first player s in a marvellous manner The music is fast and furious but cannot be kept up for a long stretch at a time As with the other instruments this one is heard to advantage some distance off The buzzing of a certain kind of beetle is also made to do duty with children as a kind of toy instrument The unfortunate beetle is caught and fixed up with grass so that he cannot get away although his wings are free to buzz with as much as he likes In order to make this beetle music the insect is held by the grass in front of the opened mouth According as the mouth is opened so does the buzzing sound vary There are many other kinds of African musical instruments mostly of a very simple kind giving forth but a note or two peculiar to the African and beloved by him The children are on the whole not unmusical and can be trailed to sing very sweetly indeed But I am sure they like their own songs best CHAPTER XVI HINDRANCES TO THE GOSPEL Now I think I had better not write much more about Africa and its children lest I tire you There are many other interesting things one would like to tell you but I am afraid this book is already quite long enough In India and in China and in other lands I am sure it is harder than it is in Africa to win the people for Christ Yet there are many hindrances too in the black man s way If all Africa is to be Christ s then Mohammedanism in the north must be overcome and must be prevented from creeping down southwards It is already well over the equator especially on the east coast and if left unhindered will spread right onwards But the Church of Christ at home must see that this does not happen and Christians must put forth all their strength in the cause of their Lord and Master And you children too have your part to play a part which is told you in this little hymn of which I have copied two verses The fields are all white And the reapers are few We children are willing But what can we do To work for our Lord in His Harvest We ll work by our prayers By the offerings we bring By small self denials The least little thing May work for our Lord in His Harvest Another enemy of Christ in Africa is the native s belief in the customs and superstitions of their forefathers The old people cling to these and tell the children that the Gospel is only white men s stories They die hard these old superstitions but they are slowly and surely disappearing before the light of God s message To obey Christ means that a great deal of the old life must be given up and put away altogether and it is here that the struggle begins Temptations to drift back into the old way of living beset the African Christian on all sides They come from without and from within and only the word of God planted in his heart can keep him from falling Polygamy is one of the great obstacles in his path I wonder if you know what that big word means In words it means that the men may marry many wives but in reality it means that the women and children are living in conditions that give them but little chance of rising out of the darkness by which they are surrounded I remember how much surprised I was when told that a certain little girl who had been at a village school but who was now withdrawn was married She was not really married of course only bespoken as it were by a big bearded man who already had more than one wife The girl had therefore been taken from school and was lost to Mission influence In Africa the girls have but little of the happy girlhood known in England for they step from childhood right into womanhood There is another enemy of Christ in Africa that I do not care to write to you about because it comes from our own race but it would not be fair to make no mention of it whatever The force of example goes a long long way in Africa and often does a great deal more than words It is what you do rather than what you say that first attracts the heathen Now if a careless white man forgets this and like the prodigal son in the far off country gives himself up to the evil ways of living he is doing a great deal of harm to Christ s Kingdom in Africa and is putting a serious stumbling block in the way of the poor black people If such white men would but remember that they come from a Christian land and behave towards their ignorant black neighbours as Christian gentlemen this enemy of the Gospel would soon be laid low Let me now tell you a little how missionary work among the heathen Africans is carried on In different missions the work is carried on in different ways but the end is always the same that the Gospel be preached to the heathen Many of the missions divide their work into four parts One is called Evangelistic that is the part of the work in which the Gospel is preached to the people Another is called Medical because doctors and nurses join in the mission work to heal the sick and help the helpless Another part is Educational the teaching of the people in school so that they may be able to read the Word of God The last part is called Industrial for in it the African Christians are taught trades to show them that work is not for slaves only and to make them useful members of the community Of course in every mission you may not find all those four departments of work Some missions are mainly Evangelistic others Industrial but in all large missions in Africa you generally find the four In the evangelistic work the missionary fresh from home is at a great disadvantage till he has mastered the native language Then this difficulty over he finds the way open to the black man s heart Experience however is showing us more and more that it is not the white man who will evangelise Africa but the African and the work of the white missionary is more and more being reduced to the training of the native evangelists who will carry the message of love to the people Hospital School and Industrial work have in Africa been practically forced upon the missionaries The native of Africa sick is most helpless and the native of Africa well is most indifferent to sickness in others Hence the constant ministration to his own sick folks by white doctors and nurses fills him with astonishment and causes him to think why this should be done It is a magnificent object lesson to the native of the practice in our lives of the Gospel of Christ One of the best gifts that can be given to any race of people is the gift of the Bible in their own tongue But to prevent the Bible being a sealed book to them the people must first be taught how to read So the missionary must turn school master and teach his people their letters Here then is the beginning of educational work and it is found a great help to the evangelistic For in school reading is not the only subject taught The children learn as they never otherwise could the story of Jesus And the teacher is naturally the evangelist So preaching and teaching in Africa go hand in hand Then there is work such as the African is not accustomed to He is by no means lazy as is so often said by ill informed people but he has to be taught that work is not for inferiors only Hence all kinds of useful trades are taught in large missions The Africans make very good carpenters gardeners bricklayers and printers In fact they pick up readily such trades as are taught them Of course at their present stage of development they cannot be compared with white workman and should never so be compared but they do exceedingly well so far as they are able In thus educating and training their people the missions are endeavouring to make their converts Christians who can read their Bibles and who will prove themselves to be useful and industrious members of the community in which they live CHAPTER XVII METHODS OF MISSION WORK In this chapter which must be the last I want to let you see as well as possible a little mission work in the various departments you read about in the preceding chapter Let me begin with the evangelistic In a missionary magazine I have come across a description which will suit the purpose very well Here it is a visit to a village preaching Our machila carriers are impatient to be off They are not always so anxious about an early start but to day we can sympathise with their impatience for the hot weather is upon us and travelling during the heat of the day is anything but comfortable A start is made at last and we are now as eager as our boys to see the end of the seven or eight mile journey It will take us almost two hours to do this short distance two hours of as unpleasant travelling as one could wish to be saved from for machila travelling is at the best but a mild form of being tossed in a blanket The carriers keep up an incessant chatter all the way varied at times with a break into the chorus of one of their machila songs Gurr r r Mwana wa mkango Ine Child of a lion I am fierce Fierce am I child of a lion Gurr r r Gurr r r Such is the complaint of one of the carriers as he sweats at the machila pole He imitates with wonderful skill the deep growl of the lion and fondly compares himself for strength to the king of beasts The other boys with lusty chorus give him every support in his contention and even we agree judging from his deep growls that he must really be what he says he is and soon the chorus ends But here we are at Chentambo s village Our machila men promptly retire under the shade of the nearest tree and stretch themselves out to rest The service has already begun and if we want to be in time next Sunday we must leave very early Che Bernard is giving an address the gist of which is the contrast between the old heathen life of superstition and darkness and the new way of the cross of truth and light and life eternal of the love of God for fallen mankind and the great sacrifice of Christ Jesus our Saviour It is skilfully placed before the audience much better than could be done by a white man The people are interested they understand and they KNOW that Bernard s way is the right one You can read it on their faces Old customs and superstitions however die hard and to morrow perhaps even to day many of those eager listeners will be the same careless indifferent lot they were yesterday But the seed is not falling only in stony places customs and superstitions cannot always choke it By and by will come the harvest and the triumph of the Word While Bernard is speaking let us look around That we are in the school is evident for there is the blackboard and there the easel Over on the other side hangs a syllable card But on Sunday it is the Nyumba ya Mulungu House of God and here we are surrounded by such a crowd as never enters school Men women and children of all ages are sitting upon the poles which do duty for seats But when we run our eyes over the crowd we find that the majority are women and children Of grown men there are few Where may they be They may perhaps be out of the district on plantations at the railway or down to the river for loads but they may also be somewhere not so far away beer drinking There is however quite a goodly number of youths among our hearers The audience is happy noisily so There is no such quiet here as is given to a home preacher The little fat brown shining babies will not be still they insist upon making themselves heard all through the address and it is only when one has become most outrageous in his conduct that his mother thinks it necessary to let him see the trees outside But when the white man gets up to begin to speak all these tiny brown mortals seem by instinct to plot against him No doubt his white face is the cause of it for he is always greeted as only black babies can welcome a white speaker Bernard however goes calmly on He is used to this kind of thing and he does not suffer from nerves So too with his audience not a word is lost Crash down goes a seat broken in two by the weight of some half dozen ponderous dames But this is quietly ignored by the rest of the audience and the heavy ones proceed to accommodate themselves to a seat on the floor as if nothing out of the way had happened Then two dogs have disagreed and become unpleasant to one another till a few vigorous cuffs and a blow from a stick convince our canine friends that to day they must be on their best behaviour fit and proper for dogs admitted to such an assembly But the babies have their own way and perform an involuntary accompaniment all the time of the service Bernard has finished now He has urged the people to come to a decision to day not to put off till the to morrow which never comes Now is the time to take a stand on the side of truth and righteousness Who will take his stand now And so he leaves his audience to answer his final appeal A hymn one of the few which the school children have learned has been given out by Bernard He reads the first verse Mwamva mau a Mulungu Mukabvomeranji ko Kodi musandula mtima Ndi kumvera Yesu yo Bvomerani Bvomerani Bvomerani msanga tu You have heard the call of Jesus And your answer now must give Turn to Him your heart so precious And obeying learn to live Oh believe Him Oh believe Him Oh believe Him quickly do The singing is robust there is no absence of sound and the hymn is enjoyed by all It may not be the finest of music but it is living real earnest Then follows a short prayer and the service is over In a few minutes men women babies and dogs are out into the sunshine and we are enjoying nay gulping down the fresh air The hearers class has now assembled and we endeavour to teach a few of the great truths of our faith to this little company of young men and women To this little class we look for the things of the future Here at least the ground is not stony The seed is being sown in good soil and by God s blessing will bear fruit in the future and become the foundation on which to build another church When the lesson is over we have a few minutes talk with Bernard and some of the boys to give and to receive words of encouragement in the work Then once more to our machila and back home our Mwana wa mkango being as fierce as ever Guwr r r Mwana wa mkango Ine Guwr r r Mwana wa mkango Ine Guwr r r Guwr r r Illustration A MISSION SCHOOL CLASS Now let me send you along with a mission lady to visit a village school so that you may know a little about the educational work of an African mission But I am afraid you cannot go to the village so I must let the lady tell of her visit herself This is what she writes and had you gone with her you would have seen it all with your own eyes Our Donna is coming Our Donna is coming Thus heralded we approach the village a flock of small boys who have come to meet us dancing along before the machila shrieking at the pitch of their shrill young voices Our Donna has come announces that we have reached the village courtyard There stands the school a little grass shed with forms like bird perches and the teacher conspicuous by his clean white clothes and Kungauma the headman are waiting there to welcome me After a little a wheezy horn is blown by a stalwart young man and the scholars begin to assemble Meantime I pay a visit to the women s quarters where the older women are busy pounding the maize and sifting the flour After a few words of friendly greeting enquires about their work and notice of their babies for a black mother as well as a white one likes to see her bairns respeckit like the lave I return to the school It is full to overflowing A hymn is sung and prayers are said by the teacher then the classes arrange themselves on their respective perches I begin to examine Class while an admiring circle of fond mothers and sympathising friends squats outside After going conscientiously through the lessons of Class we go on to Class and I hear them their allotted task But time is flying I ask what other classes still remain to be examined Class and an Infant replies the teacher indicating their whereabouts I glance at the dozen or so of eager little faces that compose Class and then look towards the Infant He may be such legally so called but to my astonishment I see the stalwart young man who performed upon the bronchitic horn It turns out later that he is the most advanced pupil in the school and is reading an English book called the Infant Reader hence his name Leaving him and Class for another day I call the young women and girls to begin sewing Forty are in my class and more would like to enter but I cannot give proper attention to a larger number One is advanced to enough sew a child s frock several are hemming sashes most of them are at the elementary patch stage As I give out the seams I glance at their hands Some conscious of cleanliness and virtue will voluntarily turn up their little pink palms for my inspection Mine are clean Adonna look at mine while others have to be sent to wash Soon the class is hard at work Some learn very quickly others find the management of the needle almost beyond their powers some need words of praise and encouragement to help them to persevere while others require judicious fault finding and criticism to nip incipient vanity in the bud A few words about the use of the words Please and Thank you a few lessons in the elements of gentle bearing to each other courtesy to my self is never lacking are taken in very good part and remembered and put into practice In the course of the day s lesson which lasts two and a half to three hours several may get advanced from the patch to the sash stage The price of the ordinary sash is sixpence The work done in all the sewing classes is sold later at a little bazaar and the proceeds are given to some scheme in connection with the native church I hear the girls planning how they will manage to buy the sash when it is hemmed I have fowls at home worth sixpence says one I have only one fowl but it can lay eggs says another Some having no source of income can but regretfully admire and envy their more fortunate companion About two o clock I take in the work again and proceed to do a little simple surgery the binding up of ulcers chiefly Anything serious I decline to dress advising the sufferers to come to Hospital but the simple sores which are sadly common are quite within my powers It brings me into touch with the people at another point of contact and increases our sympathy The dressings done and the farewells said I call my carriers get into my machila and off we go my men singing lustily as they bear me swiftly along the native path The village lies close among the hills and the path winds in and out through native gardens and bush and long grass while two streams and a bog have to be forded On either side rise the everlasting hills solemn grand restful beautiful at all times in sunshine or shadow In about an hour we leave the native path and turn into the dusty high road and a very short time finds us again at the mission And now to show you mission hospital work I have found in the same magazine the story of Gwebede the Angoni labourer His home was in far Angoniland the village where his childhood had passed where he played through many a sunny day rolling in the sand till he was white fighting mock battles with big grasses for spears tying little houses of grass and sticks and lurking in them all play and no school and at night time sleeping in his mother s hut close to the fire beside the dogs and the chickens Now he is a little boy perhaps ten years old and when his brothers and uncles and companions are getting ready to go off to work with the white men Gwebede joins the party He will work for three months and then come proudly home with his earnings His earnings will be an altogether unimaginable extent of beautiful white calico Perhaps it will be enough to pay his mother s hut tax and when that is paid they will tuck the yellow edged paper with the stamp on it safely away among the shiny black grass on the inside of the roof So he trots gaily along the narrow path carrying on a stick over his shoulder some yellow cobs of maize for food by the way At night he is very tired and after roasting his corn and grinding it up with his little white grinders he very soon drops asleep The party travel for a day or two and then stop to work for a day at some village to earn food for the further journey In about a week they reach their destination and see the coffee planters broad acres of cleared ground where in rows grow the coffee plants as big as gooseberry bushes some of them a little bigger Then is Gwebede installed with hoe in hand amongst the coffee Illustration ATTACKED BY A LEOPARD Now one morning early Gwebede got up and had just stepped out of the grass shelter where he slept when a great leopard sprang on him caught him by the back of the neck in its mouth and bounded off with him as easily as a cat would do with a mouse Gwebede s brothers are waked from their sleep and look out A leopard they shout as they seize hold of the red brands of their evening fire and rush out yelling as they run Into the grass they dash yonder is the leopard after him He is frightened he drops the boy he is off Then they carefully pick up Gwebede Poor little Gwebede Is he dead No but there is a great wound as if the leopard had taken a mouthful away from the back of his head They take him to their master who promptly binds up the wound and sends them off with a letter to the hospital It is a long distance and it is late in the afternoon when they reach the mission This was the first we saw of Gwebede There did not seem to be much hope for him A little thin boy with a face full of terror whom the slightest movement made to cry out with pain He refused to swallow medicine so we injected under his skin a little dose of that blessed drug that takes away pain and in a few minutes he was asleep Then we washed and dressed his wound A leopard s teeth are such dirty things that the wound they make is very difficult to get clean One has to wash and wash and wash for a long time going carefully into all the holes and comers As the days passed the pain became less and the wound began to heal For several days Gwebede cried a good deal and we had to repeat the dose under his skin to put him to sleep Then we noticed that he was beginning to enjoy his food and one day the attendant told us that Gwebede had laughed These were good signs A few weeks later if you could have seen Gwebede you would have seen that he was no longer thin but getting quite respectably stout and also that he was constantly smiling The night attendant noticed however that he sometimes started and cried out in his sleep This is the way with people that have been hurt by wild beasts For long afterwards they dream dreadful dreams Indeed some of them are afraid to sleep alone They can t help thinking that a beast will come into the room One day Gwebede s brothers came to take him home They said that the whole party from their village were about to start for home We begged them to leave Gwebede with us to be attended to and we asked them to come back for him in a month They said they were afraid to go back without him because Gwebede s mother would say What have you done with Gwebede We told them that Gwebede was not well enough to do without having his wound dressed They saw also that he was quite happy in the ward So they decided to go back to their master and do another month s work and at the end of the month to come again for Gwebede The month passed Gwebede walked about slowly and sedately holding his head in the air because his neck was stiff He got fatter and fatter till his face grew like a little round moon a black moon full of smiles and dimples He was the jolliest little boy you could imagine Then came again the big brothers Gwebede s neck was now quite healed The great open wound had closed up and now there was only a scar left Soon he was dancing and skipping along the road with his brothers having clean forgotten the stiffness of his neck and that was the last we saw of little Gwebede Now that you have heard such a great deal about Africa and its children and about mission work are you not glad my dear young friends that you are enjoying the privilege of helping to make Christ known among the black people that you are helping them to learn to read and write that you are helping them to be taught useful trades and that you are helping to bind up their wounds and ease their pain I know that you are We all want Africa to belong to Christ and in God s own time it will be so Meantime we must not faint or be weary although the fight against the powers of darkness be fierce and long Africa the dark continent must emerge from darkness at the call of her Lord and Master and take her place among the nations who live in the Light of the Saviour of the world Spirit of truth and love Life giving holy Dove Speed forth thy flight Move o er the water s face Bearing the lamb of grace And in Earth s darkest place Let there be light TRANSCRIBER S NOTES Italicized text is surrounded by underscores italics Obvious

produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive WAR CHESS OR THE GAME OF BATTLE INVENTED BY COLONEL CHARLES RICHARDSON NEW YORK C B RICHARDSON PUBLISHER BROADWAY Entered according to Act of Congress in the year BY CHARLES B RICHARDSON In the Clerk s Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York COMPOSITION OF THE GAME OF BATTLE The Game of Battle represents two antagonistic armies one of which the Attacking or Invading Army is composed of four figures each representing a regiment of Light Infantry five figures each representing a regiment of Infantry of the Line two figures each representing a regiment of Cavalry two figures each representing a battery of Artillery and one figure a wagon representing the Supply Train in which it is to be supposed is carried all of the subsistence ordnance stores etc necessary for the maintenance and effectiveness of the army The object of the Attacking Army will be to capture the Citadel The other army called the Defending Army is composed of four figures each representing a regiment of Light Infantry five figures each representing a regiment of Infantry of the Line two figures each representing a regiment of Cavalry two figures each representing a battery of Artillery and one figure the Citadel representing a city in which are arms ammunition foundries subsistence supplies and all kinds of government property which it is of vital importance to hold The object therefore of the Defending Army will be to secure the Citadel against capture RULES OF THE GAME OF BATTLE Light Infantry moves one two or three squares at the discretion of the player directly forward right or left obliquely and one or two squares in any other direction and can A take Light Infantry Infantry of the Line Cavalry and Artillery Infantry of the Line moves one or two squares in any direction at the discretion of the player and takes Light Infantry Infantry of the Line Cavalry and Artillery Cavalry moves one two or three squares at the discretion of the player in any direction and takes Light Infantry Infantry of the Line Cavalry and Artillery Artillery moves one two or three squares at the discretion of the player diagonally and can B take Artillery but cannot take Light Infantry Infantry of the Line or Cavalry though it can check them that is neither of those figures can come within the range of the Artillery except when protected by Artillery of its side in which case Light Infantry Infantry of the Line Cavalry or Artillery can move on the first square next to the Artillery of their side but Light Infantry Infantry of the Line or Cavalry cannot occupy the second or third square nor can either of the last named figures occupy the first square next to the Artillery of their side if it is also the first square next to the Artillery of the other side Artillery can be placed there but of course could be taken by the Artillery of the other side See Plate Figure Artillery does not cover or command the second or third square from it when a figure intervenes See Plate Figure When a piece of artillery bears on a figure of the other side that is not on the first square next to the Artillery of its side if Cavalry Light Infantry or Infantry of the Line it must move out of range of Artillery See Plate Figure Artillery cannot be moved leaving a figure of Cavalry Light Infantry or Infantry of the Line of its side in range of Artillery of the opposite side See Plate Figure Artillery cannot take the Citadel but when placed so as to command it the defending party must bring some figure to the defence and take or drive off the Artillery of the attacking party before moving otherwise Artillery cannot take the Wagon but when a piece of Artillery of the defending side is placed so as to bring the Wagon within its range if the attacking party cannot take that piece of Artillery then the Wagon must be moved out of its range The Wagon cannot occupy the second or third square from its Artillery if that square is in range of the Artillery of the defending side nor can it occupy the first square next to the Artillery of its side if it is also the first square next to the Artillery of the defending side Should all of the figures of a side be taken except the Artillery that side loses the game as Artillery cannot take the Citadel or Wagon Light Infantry Infantry of the Line or Cavalry can take the Citadel or Wagon The capture of the Citadel or Wagon will decide the game REMARKS ILLUSTRATING THE POWER OF THE FIGURES IN THE GAME AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF TROOPS IN THE FIELD The inventor has endeavored to give to the figures of his game a relative power which would as nearly as practicable accord with that of the arms represented It will be observed that the Infantry of the Line moves one or two squares in any direction and can take either Infantry Cavalry or Artillery while the Cavalry can move one two or three squares in any direction and can take either Cavalry Infantry or Artillery We know that in a country comparatively level such as the board represents and presenting no obstacle except the river Infantry or Cavalry can move in any direction and under some circumstances either of those arms is good against the other It is of course necessary that there should be some distinction in the moves of the different figures and as Cavalry can move more rapidly than Infantry it has power to move three squares while the Infantry of the Line moves but two Perhaps it will be said by some that the Cavalry has the advantage of the Infantry but on placing a piece of Cavalry and a piece of Infantry on the board by cautious playing it will be found almost impossible to capture the Infantry with the single piece of Cavalry In the field a regiment of Infantry attacked by a regiment of Cavalry might easily escape altogether or may repulse and capture the regiment of Cavalry The reverse may happen and the Cavalry well handled may defeat and capture the regiment of Infantry The Light Infantry moves one two or three squares directly forward right or left obliquely and one or two squares in any other direction The object of this is chiefly that there shall be a distinguishing power between it and the Infantry of the Line Light Infantry in the field does or should have the advantage in moving more rapidly besides it often has arms of a longer range and can be used more successfully when a sudden and rapid movement is necessary The Artillery moves diagonally and has a range of three squares on the diagonals It cannot move perpendicularly or laterally therefore has no power in those directions The Artillery can attain any position on the board but cannot always reach it directly as does the Infantry and Cavalry but in many instances must make a detour to the right or left This distinguishing move is proper inasmuch as a carriage cannot always follow the course of a man or horse yet it may reach any point that they can in a country such as is represented by the board Infantry or Cavalry cannot move in range of Artillery of the opposing side except when protected by Artillery of their side etc Artillery in the field may occupy a position several approaches to which it may so thoroughly command that it would be impracticable for Infantry or Cavalry to take it unassisted by Artillery by either of those approaches Artillery would have to be brought up in order to operate on the first named Artillery or some other line of attack must be sought In the game when one piece of Artillery is not protected by another there are four other points at which it may be assailed namely the angles of the square But when one piece of Artillery is supported by another neither can be taken by Cavalry or Infantry without the aid of their Artillery C If a battery in the field occupied a position commanding thoroughly all of the approaches to it and another battery of the same side was placed a short distance behind it say in easy range and commanded the first battery it would be very difficult for Cavalry or Infantry to take the first mentioned battery and if they succeeded in taking it they could not easily if at all hold it while under the fire of the supporting battery It may appear that the Artillery in the game has too much power but it must be remembered that a piece of Artillery of one side can always take a piece of Artillery of the other side that is placed in its range It often occurs in the field that one battery is brought up close under the fire of another to dislodge it and if both are well served one must soon give way See Plate Figure The Wagon D representing the Supply Train moves diagonally like the Artillery but only one or two squares at a time for it should not move so rapidly therefore it does not move so far The player should be careful to guard the Wagon for if it is captured he loses the game An invading army entering a country where supplies cannot be procured must necessarily carry them with him and should his train be captured with a good army in his front he would be in great danger of destruction SUGGESTIONS TO PLAYERS The attacking party should first determine upon a plan of attack Then proceed to arrange his figures in proper order for the accomplishment of his plan He should guard his lines by throwing forward Light Infantry and Cavalry but will endeavor to avoid an engagement until his order of attack is formed Unless to secure a very decided advantage when once put in operation his first plan should not be abandoned The time lost in arranging a new plan may be taken advantage of by the defending party who might assume the offensive and win the game The defending party at the opening of the game should throw forward Light Infantry and Cavalry to guard against any rapid movement to take the Citadel that may be attempted by the attacking party with Cavalry and Light Infantry This will also give him time and space for moving up and arranging his figures in proper order for defence In advancing the Cavalry and Light Infantry great caution should be observed in placing the figures on the squares most desirable for checking the advance of the attacking party while at the same time they are not endangered No figure should be lost if it can be avoided at this stage of the game and no figure of the attacking party except Artillery should be taken at the risk of the loss of one of the defending party Indeed the defending side should continue to remain strictly on the defence till a good opportunity is offered for an attack as for instance when the figures of the attacking party are scattered and not in supporting distance of each other It is however best not to cross the river until the attacking side is weakened by a considerable loss Early in the game an opportunity is seldom offered by a good player where it is safe for the defending party to cross the river with a single figure and it is only when the attacking party has been weakened by the loss of three or four figures that two or three figures can be spared from the defence When such advance is determined upon be always careful to leave the Citadel as securely guarded as possible If the attacking party be an expert player he will avoid an engagement until he has arranged his figures in order for a grand attack If it is discovered that he is thus engaged every good opportunity to annoy him and prevent the formation of his plan should be taken advantage of by man uvres feints and sometimes real attacks particularly at his Artillery and his Artillery should be taken if possible even if it involve the loss of one or two figures of the defending party for by the loss of one piece of his Artillery he will be more crippled than by the loss of almost any two other figures The game requires the constant attention of the players Often the slightest mistake leads to defeat therefore be careful that every move is for a purpose E Illustration PLATE figure figure Explanation to Plate The board has one hundred and thirty nine squares that can be occupied It represents a comparatively level field traversed by a river impassable except at the fords and bridge In crossing the fords and bridge the figures move one two or three squares according to their power as elsewhere on the board The short black lines indicate the entrances to the fords and bridge A figure cannot take or check another across the river except at the fords and bridge For example a figure on square cannot take or check a figure on square nor can a figure on square take or check a figure on square or Squares are numbered in Plate ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIGURES ON COMMENCING THE GAME On the defending side Cavalry occupies the first square on the right of the line of nine squares Artillery the second Infantry of the Line third fourth and fifth Cavalry sixth Artillery seventh Infantry of the Line eighth and ninth The Citadel fifth square from the right of the first line of eight squares Light Infantry first third fifth and seventh squares of the second row of seven squares The figures of the attacking side are arranged like those of the defence except that the Wagon is placed on the fifth square of the line of nine squares and a piece of Infantry of the Line on the first square immediately in front of it Explanation to Plate FIGURE When two pieces of Artillery of opposite sides are thus placed no figure except Artillery can occupy the squares one or two If Artillery is placed on either square it can be taken by the Artillery of the other side FIGURE The figure on square nine cannot now move on square seven because a figure cannot occupy the second or third square from its Artillery if that square is in range of the Artillery of the other side But if the figure on square eight moves to square six then the figure on square nine could occupy square seven for that square will not then be covered by the Artillery on square five Should the figure on square eight be placed on square four then the Artillery on squares three and five do not protect each other and in that case the Cavalry on square ten could take either of them or the figure on square nine could take the Artillery on square five and if it were taken by the figure that was on square eight now on square four then the Artillery on square three could be taken by the Cavalry on square ten FIGURE In this case if the Artillery on square fourteen is moved to square fifteen then the figures on squares sixteen and seventeen would be in range of that piece and must move one at a time of course or after one is moved the Artillery on square eighteen may be brought up on the next square to the remaining figure For example if the figure on square sixteen be moved out of range then the Artillery on square eighteen could be moved to square nineteen to the support of the figure on square seventeen If either of the squares sixteen or seventeen should be occupied by Artillery of course that figure could take the Artillery moved to square fifteen FIGURE White figures representing the attacking party and the black figures the defending party The attacking party having the move suppose the figure of Cavalry on square twenty is moved to square twenty one or twenty two then the Artillery on square twenty five is in danger of capture when the attacking party has another move Now the Artillery on square twenty five cannot move leaving the figure on square twenty four in range of the Artillery on square twenty three If the player desires to save his Artillery on square twenty five he might move the figure or square twenty four to square twenty six in order to protect his Artillery from capture by the Cavalry moved to twenty one or twenty two and if that piece were taken by the Cavalry he would then have an opportunity to move his Artillery away Illustration PLATE figure figure figure figure Illustration PLATE figure figure Explanation to Plate FIGURE Shows how the Wagon may be taken Suppose the attacking party having been repulsed with considerable loss is driven back from the river pursued by the defending party and the figures of the two sides occupy the squares indicated in this plate the white figures representing the invading army and the black figures the defending army The defending party having the move suppose the Artillery on square fourteen is moved to square thirteen Then the Cavalry on square eight must move as no figure except Artillery can occupy the first square next to the Artillery of its side if it is also the first square next to the Artillery of the other side If the Cavalry on square eight is moved to square four then the Artillery now on square thirteen can take the Artillery on square five and could be taken by the Cavalry moved to square four or the Infantry on square six or the Artillery on square two Suppose it the Artillery of defending side having taken the Artillery on square five is taken by the Cavalry now occupying square four then the Cavalry on square eleven could take the Artillery on square two and if it the Cavalry of defending side moved to square two is taken by the Cavalry of attacking party now on square five or the Infantry on square six then the Infantry of defending party on square seven could take the Wagon on square one There are many other combinations for the capture of the Wagon FIGURE Shows how the Citadel may be taken Light Infantry Infantry of the Line or Cavalry of the attacking side can take the Citadel when it is within their range if no figure intervenes For example if the Artillery of the defending side is placed as indicated in this figure on squares eight and ten a figure of Cavalry or Light Infantry of the attacking party on square one or a figure of Cavalry Infantry of the Line or Light Infantry being on square two three four six or seven or a figure of Cavalry on square five could take the Citadel if the attacking side had the move But suppose the defending party had the move and a figure of Cavalry or Infantry occupied square one or two and either piece of Artillery was placed on square nine then the figure on square one or two could not take the Citadel but must move out of range of the Artillery If the Artillery on square ten is moved to square nine then the figure of the attacking side on square two could occupy square three and the next move could take the Citadel or if the Artillery on square eight were moved to square nine then the figure on square two could move to square seven and on its next move could take the Citadel for though the Citadel would be in range of the Artillery on square nine that would not prevent its capture A city may be very well defended on one side and yet might be easily taken at another point Of course the Cavalry and Infantry should co operate with the Artillery in defending the Citadel and the player should endeavor to prevent the attacking party from occupying any square from which it could be taken Explanation to Plate FIGURE If the Artillery on square is moved to square the Artillery on square can take it or move out of range If the Artillery on square takes the Artillery moved to square then it could be taken by the Cavalry on square or the Artillery on square If it on the other hand moves to square it could be taken by the Artillery on square and if it is moved to square or it could be taken by the figure on square But if it is not moved at all then the Artillery moved to square could take it its next move FIGURE Shows how the figures of the game can be moved Cavalry can be moved one two or three squares in any direction at the discretion of the player provided the way is not obstructed by another figure For instance the Cavalry on square could not be moved to square because the figure on square intervenes Nor if the cavalry is moved to square could it afterwards be moved to square or while a figure occupied square If the Cavalry on square is moved to square it could afterwards be moved to square or or to or or to or or to or to or or to or or to or etc Light Infantry moves one two or three squares directly forward right or left obliquely and one or two squares in any other direction at the discretion of the player Now if a piece of Light Infantry occupies square it could be moved directly forward to square or left obliquely to square or right obliquely to square or to the left to square or obliquely to the left and rear to square or to the rear to square or obliquely to the right and rear to square or and to the right to square or Infantry of the Line moves one or two squares at the discretion of the player in any direction If a piece of Infantry of the Line were on square it could be moved either to square or etc Artillery moves diagonally one two or three squares at a time at the discretion of the player A figure of Artillery being on square could be moved to square or If it were moved to square it could then be moved to square or or back to or etc If a piece of Artillery occupied square no figure of the opposite party except Artillery could be placed on square or unless that square were next to the Artillery of the other side See rules of the game relative to Artillery page The Wagon can be moved one or two squares at a time at the discretion of the player The Wagon being on square could be moved to square or etc Illustration PLATE figure figure FOOTNOTES A When a piece is taken it is removed from the board and the piece by which it is taken is placed on the square which was occupied by the captured piece B Whenever a piece of Artillery of one side is placed in range of a piece of Artillery of the other side the first piece can be taken by the second See Plate Figure C The necessity of the co operation of two or all of the different arms represented and in many instances their dependence on the support of each other is demonstrated in many real battles D The Wagon is captured in the same manner as other figures are it cannot be taken while under cover of a piece of Artillery of its side E Success sometimes rewards a bold operator

CHAMBERFIRE LONDON Printed by J TOWERS in Piccadilly And published by the Inventor J DURNO and sold by him at his House in Jermyn Street R DAVIS the Corner of Sackville Street Piccadilly and M COOPER in Paternoster Row Price Six pence Illustration A DESCRIPTION Of a New Invented STOVE GRATE The State of the Weather in this Island is so extremely variable and uncertain that the Inhabitants are obliged to keep Fires to sit by near Eight Months in the Year AND ever since the Duty laid upon Coals the Article of Fire has been so very expensive in many Parts of the Kingdom particularly in this Metropolis that it is to be hoped any Attempt to make our Rooms more warm and comfortable and that at a much less Expence than usual always free from Smoke and equally chearful as with the common Fires will meet with the Favour of the Publick THESE are some of the Advantages proposed by a new invented STOVE GRATE the Description and Uses whereof are contained in the following Sheets AND surely if ever any Invention discovered by a Mechanick deserved the Attention of the Publick this may justly lay claim to it since not only every Family but every Individual is in some degree interested in it and more especially as it is not offered as uncertain Theory but its Uses and Advantages over all others have been confirmed by Trial and Experience For one of the smallest Size of these STOVE GRATES has been set up ever since the beginning of last Winter in a common Room at the Inventor s House where several curious and ingenious Persons have been to see and observe the Effects of it and it has appeared to the Satisfaction of the best Judges that this same Room built of common Quartering and covered with Laths and Plaister Feet Inches Long Broad High with a Pair of large folding Doors at one End and a Door opening to the Stair Case at the other End in which four or five Pecks of Coals had usually been consumed every Day in a common Grate and Chimney has been kept warm ever since the New Stove was erected with no greater Quantity than one Peck of Coals a Day and with this singular Advantage that the Warmth is diffused more regularly and uniformly over the whole Room than it was before THOSE who will take the Trouble of calling will be able to form a more distinct Idea of the Construction and Use of this Machine than can be conveyed by Writing But as many People have neither the Curiosity or Opportunity for occular Inspection I shall give a particular Description of it as well as of all the other Machines that have been contrived for the like Purposes and it will appear by a fair and impartial Comparison that this is attended with greater Advantages and fewer Inconveniences than any that has ever yet been offered to the Publick BUT for the better understanding of what follows it will be necessary to explain some of the Properties of Air and Fire THE chief Properties of Air are Fluidity Gravity and Elasticity First THE Air is a Fluid consisting of Parts which have not any sensible Attraction or Cohesion betwixt themselves but of such a Shape or Form as to glide one over another and yield to the slightest Impression Of this we need no other Proof than the Ease and Freedom with which Animals breathe this Element and pass through it without any sensible Resistance Secondly THAT the Air does gravitate or act upon inferior Bodies by its Weight is demonstrable by a great many Experiments and particularly the Barometer which by the rising and falling of the Mercury shews the greater or lesser Weight of the Column of Air incumbent upon it Thirdly NOR is the Elasticity of the Air less demonstrable than either its Fluidity or Gravity AIR is an elastick Body for if it be confined or compressed within a less Space than its natural State requires it will the Moment the Restraint is removed dilate and expand itself so as to fill the same Space as before and that too with such Force as to break in Pieces the Glass or Earthen Vessel that contained it as may be seen by the common Experiment of a Bottle full of common Air strongly cork d and put under the Receiver on the Air Pump when the Air surrounding the Bottle is pump d out But what is particularly remarkable with reference to the Subject we are treating of is That Air is rarified by Heat and condensed by Cold First Air rarified and expanded by Heat becomes specifically lighter than it was before and will ascend in Air of greater Density As Matter specifically lighter than Water Cork for Instance if placed at the bottom of an empty Vessel will if Water be poured into the Vessel ascend above the Surface of the Water so rarified Air will rise in common Air till it comes to Air of equal Weight or is by Cold reduced to its former Density FOR the same Reason if a Fire be kindled in an open Place the Heat thereof will rarify the next circumambient Air and that which is more remote being heavier will press every where and in all Directions upon the Air that is rarified and drive it to the Fire the Flame and Sparks whereof will together with the rarified Air ascend in a conic Form like the Flame of a Candle in a trembling Motion as it is more or less acted upon by the Pressure of the cold Air And the Reason why the Flame is more contracted at the Top than Bottom is that the Heat at Top being less intense the next adjacent Air is less rarified and the gross Air confines it more THEREFORE when a Fire is lighted in a Chimney the Heat rarifies the Air over and next the Fire and makes it rise in the Funnel and the common Air in the Room immediately supplies its Place is rarified in its turn and rises also THIS Motion being thus generated is continued by small Inlets of Air through the Doors and Windows of the Room and the larger the Fire the greater will be the current of Air through their Crevices If the Doors and Windows are so well fitted in their Frames that all the Inlets together cannot supply so much Air as is wanted to carry off the Smoke it will then hang about the Fire gradually diminish and at length totally extinguish it VARIOUS are the Improvements that have been made in the Construction of Chimneys to increase the Degree of Heat to prevent Smoke and to save in the Article of Fuel AND notwithstanding the many Attempts to remedy the Defects in one or other of these Respects the same have hitherto come short of the End proposed Take the Article of Smoke for Instance No Builder of Character will pretend to insure all the Rooms in a new built House from smoking appears from this that they generally at first finish the Chimney Tops with what they call Roundings and if upon Trial those do not answer they either Hovel or fix Earthen Pots like a hollow Cylinder or plant Tin Tubes on the Tops not much unlike Organ Pipes inverted all which Methods not only spoil the Symmetry of the Building but what is still worse they often leave the Chimnies as Smoky as they were at first after a considerable Sum has been spent on a Cure IN order to remedy all or some of the Inconveniences already mentioned a great Variety of Chimnies Stove Grates and Close Stoves have been invented I shall describe some of the principal ones that have fallen under my Observation and shall endeavour as I go along to point out their Advantages and Defects FIRST Mons Gauger has described seven sorts of Chimnies which however all agree in general as to the Construction and Disposition of the principal Parts HIS Manner of Performance is by Plates of Iron Copper and Brass placed in the Chimney after its being prepared to receive them at four Inches from the Back Jambs and Hearth with a Communication to the external Air which first entered under the Hearth Plate and made several Turnings and Windings through Partitions between the inside of the Chimney and those Plates representing as it were a re curved Canal one End whereof joins the outward Air and the other comes out of the Top of one of the Jambs of the Chimney The Use and Intent of these Chimnies is only for burning of Wood the Heat whereof is more diffused than that of Turf or Peat THE Invention was extremely ingenious the Room was warmed in all its Parts with great Equality cold Air was prevented rushing through Crevices the Funnel was supplied by a Trap Door or Bellows upon the Hearth Plate and much less Wood served to make a Fire but the Expence was found to be so great especially in old Chimnies that they never came into much use and are now entirely laid aside The upright Heat was likewise all lost in all those Chimnies SECONDLY the ingenious Dr Desaguliers gives the Construction of two kinds of Chimnies one for burning Turf and Peat upon the Hearth and the other for Sea Coal in a Stove Grate made in a particular Manner IN the Description of the First he says That in Chimnies where Wood is burnt the Cavities behind the Back and Sides after the Manner that the French Author directs are very useful but where you have the Heat very strong it will be proper to make the Cavities as near the Fire as possible and tho the Course of the Air will be shorter yet the great Heat it acquires in that Case will make Amends for the Shortness of the Passage THE Shape and Manner of the Chimney is the same as directed by Mons Gauger with this difference that the Doctor s has no Cavity under the Hearth only a divided Box made of Plate Iron upon which the Fire is placed and an horizontal Cavity behind the Back faced with Plate Iron so low that the Fire lies against it Through this Preparation comes a Stream of external Air in several Turnings and Windings and from thence is carried up a Passage within the Brick Work in one of the Corners as high as the Mantle Piece from the Corner it is brought forward to the under side of the Mantle Piece where it makes several Turnings in a Tin Canal from which it is at last convey d into the Room HE likewise recommends the Trap Bellows in this Construction of Stoves THE Construction of the Second Sort consists of a Grate of a particular Make with a Box of Plate Iron behind the Back that has only three Cavities one End communicates with the outward Air to bring it through those Cavities obliquely to the Corner in the Brick Work from thence it is brought forward in the upper part of the Jamb quite into the Tin Canal behind the Mantle Piece as in the last Construction but the same Inconvenience attends both these sort of Chimnies that the upright Heat which is at least three fourths of what proceeds from the Fire is almost wholly lost as it is in all the open Fire Places THIRDLY the Dutch and German Stoves which are very different THE Dutch Stove has a Flue proceeding from the Top which is sometimes bent downwards and then goes into the Chimney through a false Back at about four Inches from the true Back That Space has a Communication with the Funnel and all the other Parts of the Chimney are wholly closed up AND there are others which have the Flue straight upward that goes into the Chimney and all the Funnel closed up round the Flue of the Stove The First Sort in my Opinion is the best for there is not so much of the upright Heat lost as in this and the Chimney cannot so readily smoke because the Space between the false Back and the true Back obstruct in some degree the Passage of the Air down the Chimney Both these sorts have a small Iron Door into the Room which in some degree changes the Air as it flows to that Opening part of which goes off with the Smoke and its Place is supplied by the entering Air from Doors Windows and Crevices But as there is so small a Change of Air the Room will soon be warm the Chimney being wholly closed up very little Air is required to supply the small Door of the Stove and that only can enter at the Door or Windows of the Room Little Fuel serves for almost all the Heat is saved This small change of Air makes these Stoves wholesomer or at least pleasanter than the German Stoves but there is little sight of the Fire and no other Use can be made of it but to warm the Room And if any ill Smell should happen in the Room it is not easily carried off by Reason of the slow change of Air at the little Iron Door and the Room is always somewhat suffocating especially to those who are not accustomed to it THE German Stove is not unlike a Chest for Cloaths set upon one End and is fixed into the Wall with the Top turned outwards or into another Room which open and shut as there is occasion for making and mending the Fire it warms a Room all over in a very little Time with little Fuel to make a Fire no fresh Air can enter the Room if the Door be left open no more than it would in an open Oven because there is not the least Discharge of Air in the Room But there is not any Appearance of Fire to be seen in these Stoves and they who used them were obliged to breathe the same unchanged elemental Air mixed with that inspired by all the Company FOURTHLY the Chimney in the House of Lords which was designed by way of an Improvement upon the Sieur Gauger s Chimnies FOR First the outward Air from below the House in the Passage enters under the Iron Plate commonly called the Hearth Plate which is prepared to receive it into a re curved Canal and from thence passes up the back Plate of Iron in the like Turnings and Windings near to the Top where it is divided and enters into two Tubes of Copper one placed on each side of the Funnel of a sufficient Length to appear above the Cornish there they are joined to other Conveyances one of which is carried round the Throne and ends over against the Fire and the other Conveyance is continued to the Window above the Cornish made of Tin in form of a right angled Triangle and is perforated to let out the Air There is likewise a Valve in each of these Copper Pipes or Tubes placed at a considerable distance from the Fire to open and shut at pleasure by a Thumb Latch which being shut imprisons the Air in its Passage upwards until it be hot and when opened discharges this warmed Air near the Cieling through those perforated Conveyances ACCORDING to the Construction of this Fire Place it is next to an Impossibility to warm that House with the greatest Fire that can be made in it For all the upright Heat is lost occasioned by the continual Current of Air coming in at the Doors and Crevices which forcibly drives almost all the Heat up the Chimney Secondly THE Streams of cold Air which enters under the Hearth and Back Plates where a large Stove Grate stands in its various Turnings and Windings behind these Plates and through those Tubes is but very little warmed in its Passage above the Fire in the Conveyances to the Cieling and it cannot receive any Heat from the Hearth Plate unless the Fire was made upon it as mentioned before for the bottom Bars of the Stove Grate are at so great a distance from the Iron Hearth Plate that the Fire with its downward Heat cannot reach it and not above Eight superficial Feet of the Back Plate is warmed by the Fire and considering the distance from the hot part to where the warm Air is discharged into the House nothing is clearer than that it cannot receive any considerable degree of Heat in its Passage through the Copper Pipes that convey it to the Cieling and where it is suspended and mixes slowly and imperceptibly with the colder Air in the lower part of the House so that little or no Warmth can be obtained by this Conveyance Thirdly FROM hence it appears that it would have been of much greater Use to have discharged the hot Air immediately from the hot Iron Back Plate into the Room its Effects in that Case would have been sensibly felt and it would then have ascended naturally without the help of Pipes and warmed the circumambient Air as was intended and likewise would have supported the Fire without the Assistance of any Air from the Doors and Crevices FIFTHLY Stoves placed at the End of long Rooms Coffee Houses and Tradesmen s Shops warm the Room in a little Time but the Smoke and upright Heat are both conveyed thro one and the same Tube of Iron jointed in several Pieces to bring them round the Wall and Turnings of the Chimney where they are discharged but never fail to send out some part of the Air impregnated with Sulphur so as to occasion a disagreeable Smell and often Head achs and Lowness of Spirits to those that are not accustomed to these Stoves SIXTHLY The French Stoves are much the same as the Dutch and I am informed that they have many from Holland and Germany but they have another Sort which is the Mode at present it resembles an old fashion d low Chest of Drawers with a flat Top and has swelling or rising Mouldings on all Sides which represent the Drawers It is composed of several Pieces of burnt Earth in the manner of our Earthen Ware and is placed upon a Frame of Iron at Bottom and all the Parts are luted together to complete the Body It is likewise bound about with two Iron Belts to keep all tight and has a little Door at one End like a Dutch Stove where the Fire is put into it it projects into the Room some distance from the Chimney and gives Heat from the four Sides as well as the Top There is a Flue proceeds from the back Part and an Iron Pipe fixed upon it to reach the Chimney which carries the Smoke up the Funnel and the Chimney is closed up all round the Iron Pipe it is on the same Principles as the Dutch Stove and is subject to many more Inconveniences which are not necessary to be mentioned SEVENTHLY The Pensilvanian Stove Grate comes lastly to be considered which is a curious Invention indeed contrived about Twelve or Fourteen Years ago and particularly described by Mr Franklin of Philadelphia in a Treatise intitled An Account of the New Invented Pensilvanian Fire Places printed at Philadelphia in I have lately examined one that was made in that Country all of cast Iron which I believe to be the only one in England and at the same time I saw a perfect Model of it which discovered the whole Work at one View THIS Stove Grate must infallibly cure most of the Inconveniences with which the other sorts before mentioned are attended if the Smoke Passages can be kept clean You have a full Sight of the Fire nor does it lose any of the upright Heat as in common Fire Places and smoky Chimnies will be often cured by it This Stove has likewise the Advantage of a constant Supply of fresh Air coming in warm through a Canal in the Manner before described by Dr Desaguliers with this difference that here the warm Air comes out on each Side of the Stove and is better adapted to warm the lower Air of the Room than if it came out higher in the Chimney IN this Machine the Smoke first ascends and then passing over the Iron Plates that compose the warm Air Box descends to the Bottom where it passes under a false Back about three or four Inches from the true Back of the Chimney then ascends a second time up the Funnel of the Chimney and passes out at the Top The Chimney is closed up on all Sides between the false Back and Breast of the Chimney except only in one Place where is an Opening with an Iron Door large enough for a Chimney Sweeper to creep through to sweep the Funnel but at all other times this Door is kept shut There is also a Register fixed in the Smoke Passage to give more or less Vent as shall be required THE whole is a compleat Piece of Machinery and was first intended for burning of Wood which is the common Fuel of that Country but for that Reason is not so well adapted to burn Sea Coal whose bituminous Quality would soon close up the narrow Smoke Passage and would often require cleaning and become very troublesome it being difficult to come at the Smoke Passage for if there be a Trap Door made upon the Hearth you cannot clean the Smoke Passage any farther than to the Register and there is no coming at the upper part without lifting up the Top of the Machine which is always luted down and fastened with Screw Nuts THE Defects and Inconveniences that I have occasionally pointed out in the Chimneys and Stoves already described put me upon contriving a new Machine Grate which upon Trial answers all the Ends that I proposed by it IT is built indeed and constructed upon almost the same Principles with the Pensilvanian Stove but with greater Advantages for instead of the narrow Passage for the Smoke in the Pensilvanian Stove there is a Chamber made in the Brick Work which effectually warms the Air Box and is all covered over like an Oven except a narrow Passage made of Plate Iron with a Register in it which has a Handle into the Room and may be turned upon its Axis to such a Degree of Vent as either to support or diminish or even to extinguish the Fire The Register is so contrived that it will probably want no cleaning in two or three Years but if it should by lifting up the Chimney Sweeper s Door it is done in one Minute and is equally adapted to burn Coals or Wood with more Safety and Ease than in a common Fire Place The Chamber behind the Stove is cleaned when the Chimney is swept by taking out a Piece of concealed Iron rabited into the Brick Work at the Side of the Stove and always whiten d over with the Brick Back The Chamber behind is of greater Use than warming the Air Box for being almost all closed up it is not only Proof against the Influence of the Houses and Chimnies about it that stand higher but even against Eddy or Whirl winds if they should come down the Chimney the Force whereof is broke by the Top of the Chamber and what comes through the small Opening where the Register is placed is immediately expanded and loses its Force THE whole of my Machine is less complex and of more easy Construction than any others I have mentioned and which is all I have ever seen or heard of but has Advantages besides that which no former Invention can pretend to First IT warms the Room equally all over and the Fire appears the same as in a common Stove Grate yet any Place in the Room will be as warm as that by the Side of the Fire FOR this there is occular Demonstration because Thermometers placed in the remotest Parts of the Room will not differ above one Degree a Difference which every body knows has scarce any Effect from one placed by the Side of the Chimney Secondly THE Chimney is so intirely closed up that if you sit near the Fire Place there is not the least cold Air from the Door Window or any Crevice that can offend you as in common Fire Places where at the same time that you are burnt before you are ready to freeze behind but on the contrary the warm Air here goes out at the Door when opened and will make you sensible of its Approach at Four or Five Feet distance before you enter the Door THE Doors indeed ought to be kept shut because otherwise the warm Air will be wasted as with common Fires but there is no manner of Occasion for Skreens of any sort because the Fire cannot hurt the Face neither can the cold Air offend the Back as in common Rooms where there is a common Stove Grate and a large Draught up the Chimney Thirdly TO be soon and agreeably warmed is not the only Advantage we have from this Invention but we are better warmed at less than one Third of the usual Expence at a moderate Computation When the Mercury in my Thermometer that was placed without Doors stood the last Winter at Four Degrees below the Freezing Point a Peck of Coals i e the th Part of a Chaldron was sufficient to warm the Room for the whole Day from Eight in the Morning to Eleven at Night During all that Time the Mercury within the Room stood from to Degrees much the same Degree of Heat with that of the th Day of last June at Two o Clock in the Afternoon and when that Observation was made the Weather was as warm as usual at that Time of the Year BUT before I set up this Stove which is one of the smallest there was seldom spent in the Room less than a Bushel of Coals and sometimes more in one Day according to the Degree of Cold and then we were obliged to have a Skreen to keep off the cold Air from the Backs of those who sat near the Fire and only that Part of the Room was warm which was nearest the Fire THE Air that enters the Room through the Iron Canal of the Air Box is both fresh and warm and computing the Swiftness of its Motion with the Area of its Passage it will appear that Ten Barrels or near Cubic Feet of Air is hourly introduced from the external Air if the Door of the Room be shut THIS warm Air comes into the Room with such Rapidity from the hot Iron Canal that it turns several Paper Wheels with great Velocity which are placed near the Opening that lets it into the Room But as soon as the Door of the Room is opened all the Wheels stand still which proves what has been said before That much warm Air is wasted in opening the Door because the warm or rarified Air rushes through the cold Air with great Force And the cold Air that comes in at the Door being an over balance to the Air entering from the hot Iron Canal of the Stove entirely stops it from coming into the Room while the Door is open IN like manner if the Door of the Room be shut and the Register that is fixed in the Smoke Passage be turned so near as almost to shut it up which may be done when the Coals upon the Fire are burnt to a Coke then the whole Heat of the Fire will be forced into the Room the warm Air will be stopt from coming through the hot Canal and the Paper Wheels will stand still as they did when the Door of the Room was open THIS may seem a little unaccountable but when considered it is plain that the warm Air from the hot Canal cannot come into the Room which is already full of Air and in a perfect State of Rest because there is no Passage for it to go out at the Register having closed up the Funnel and the Doors and Windows of the Room being shut THE Room in this Case will soon become suffocating in the manner of a German Stove Room and does exactly point out the Difference between that Stove and mine WHEREAS on the contrary when the Doors of the Room are shut and the Register gives a proper Vent to the Fire the warm Air in this Case is at Liberty to act as before by warming the circumambient Air in its Passage from the Mantle Piece to the Cieling where it mixes slowly and imperceptibly with the grosser Air of the Room which in its turn flows towards the Stove and Fire part whereof feeds the Fire and passes off with the Smoke and the other part after being rarified by the Heat of the Stove and Fire ascends by the Mantle piece to the Cieling as it did before repeating the like Circulation as long as there is any Heat in the Stove By which it appears that the warm Air that comes from the hot Iron Canal of the heated Air Box is sufficient to support the Fire and carry off the Smoke without the Assistance of any Air from the Crevices of the Doors and Windows of the Room BY this Means the Air in the Room is continually changed and an Advantage gained that could never be obtained by any former Contrivance of the Kind that at all Times the Air in the Room is as wholesome as the external Air and in some Respects more so For it is apparent that the Air issuing into the Room through a hot Canal of Iron can never acquire any noxious Quality and on the contrary in damp Weather when the Air is replete with Moisture and noxious Particles it will be purified in its Passage and the Moisture and Vapours will be condensed fall and stick upon the Sides of the hot Canal UPON this as well as other Accounts this Stove will be extremely useful in Hospitals and the Rooms of sick Persons with great Advantage to the Patients But this I submit to those who are better qualified to judge of such Matters Fourthly IN Common Stoves and Chimnies the upright Heat which has been computed to be Three Fourths of the whole is intirely lost as to the Purpose of warming the Room or those that are in it On the contrary in this Stove Grate a very inconsiderable part of the Heat ascends with the Smoke and all the rest is diffused gradually and equally over the whole Room Fifthly THIS Fire Place thus prepared prevents Smoke so effectually and so certainly in all Degrees and Variations of Wind and Weather that the Inventor is willing to give his Machine Gratis if ever the least Smoke is perceived in any Room where it is erected unless it may happen at the first lighting of the Fire before the Air in the Funnel is put in Motion but I have never yet seen that happen THERE is no Occasion for Chimney Boards in Summer for by turning the Register the Air is shut out so that both in Summer and Winter the Furniture and Gilding is preserved from Smoke and damp Air which are the chief Causes of the one and the other s being spoiled Sixthly IT will be obvious to every Person who examines the Construction of this Machine that the Chimney will not require sweeping in less than two or three Years and that it is morally impossible the Chimney can ever take Fire Seventhly IT has been already observed that no part of the current of Air that passes continually through the Fire is supplied from the Doors Windows or Crevices of the Room For the same Reason the Candles in all sorts of Weather will burn clear the Light will be pleasant equal and steady and there will be a considerable Saving in that Article Eighthly WHEN the Room is thoroughly warmed in the Day time it will cool but a few Degrees during the Night and by shutting up the Fire Place over Night and excluding the external Air the Fire will be found in the Morning without any sensible Diminution ready to blaze out by the Addition of a Stick of Wood or a few Coals which every body knows is an Advantage that never could be obtained in common Chimnies with a Coal Fire without a great Expence and much Danger THESE and many other Advantages that would be tedious to enumerate at present will be found to result from this useful Invention Several of the Stove Grates are already set up and Orders given for the erecting others in many Houses in London and the Country SOME are of Cast Iron in its plain natural Colour and others have a Case richly ornamented that is put on and taken off at Pleasure The Inventor hopes he shall be permitted to publish the Names and Places of Abode of those Noblemen and Gentlemen who have encouraged this undertaking BY this Method it will be in the Power of those who incline to become Purchasers to inform themselves of the Truth of every Particular by Persons of undoubted Credit and Veracity and to know with Certainty what they are to expect without laying out their Money upon what they might suppose an unexperimented Project the Success whereof might otherwise be uncertain THERE are Three Sizes of these Stove Grates adapted to the Dimensions of the Rooms where they are set up They are all made of Cast Iron which will endure longer and come much cheaper than if they were made of wrought Iron Ft In Pts The smallest High Size Price Broad in Front over all l s set up Depth from Front to Back The Space that contains the Fire within this Stove Broad in Front Depth of the Bars From Front to Back Middle Size High Pr l l Broad in Front over all set up Depth from Front to Back The Space that contains the Fire within this Stove Broad in Front Depth of the Bars From Front to Back Largest Size High Pr l l Broad in Front over all set up Depth from Front to Back The Space that contains the Fire within this Stove Broad in Front Depth of the Bars From Front to Back I FIND by my own Experience that the smallest Size of these Stoves will warm a Room of Twelve or Fourteen Foot Square or the largest Dressing Closet The Middle sized Grate will warm a Room of Feet and or Feet high The largest Size will warm a Room of Feet by and about or Feet high AS I have not advanced any thing but what I have proved from my own Experience I shall omit what might be said from the Testimony of others to Time and the real Merit of the Machine which in all Respects will answer for itself For the Beginning of this Attempt was founded upon Theory and Mechanick Principles supported by Observation and Experience of what had happened before BUT had not the same Observation and Experience likewise confirmed the Use of this and all the Advantages mentioned I should not have offered it to the Publick Jermyn Street March ADVERTISEMENT The Inventor of this Stove Grate has contrived a Stove for a Laundry which answers all the Ends desirable without any other Fire and at one Third part of the usual Expence that keeps a Fire in the common Way It is moveable to any part of the Room and stands on a boarded Floor with the greatest Safety It likewise may be placed in a Room where there is no Chimney and will serve for Airing large Rooms far preferable to the common Braziers it warms a Room sooner with greater Safety and much less Expence For Half a Bushel of Coals will go farther than a Bushel of Charcoal

Character set encoding UTF Produced by Greg Weeks Mary Meehan and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http www pgdp net START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DATELINE MARS Dateline MARS By RICHARD WILSON It was the story behind the biggest story on Mars how Fate had grimly reckoned with the Rockhead Rastol but Scott Warren of Galactic News couldn t write it yet Transcriber s Note This etext was produced from Planet Stories May Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U S copyright on this publication was renewed Scott Warren snapped off the vision screen and sat down in front of his typewriter Through the glass side of the building he could see the lights of the celebrations whose sounds he had just silenced He lighted a cigarette and started to type out the final edition of Today on Mars for transmission by Interradio to the New York bureau of the Galactic News Service He started the news roundup IOPA MARS GN Events on Mars were at a snailspace today the midpoint of the traditional three day Landing Day holiday Scott rolled the paper up in the carriage of his typewriter and jagged a line through what he had written Four days in the same sentence might get past the night desk but the New York bureau chief would send him a memo about it in the morning He started again Landing Day celebrations on Mars are at their midpoint tonight with both Earth people and natives He x ed out natives and substituted Martians remembering the memo he d got about that both Earth people and Martians forgetting their political and physical differences to take part in planetwide carnivals Business houses government offices and stores have been closed down since Friday and Pleasure is king The two great cities on Mars Iopa and Senalla are ablaze with light from their desert outskirts to the quarter mile high government buildings that mark the center of each Parades speeches Scott snubbed out his cigarette shoved his chair away from the desk He looked out over Iopa toward the government building spotted in searchlight rays from all sides of the city It was bad enough writing this stuff bad enough grinding out a routine night lead to be later dictated to Interradio for transmission across space to Earth simply because the news schedule demanded two daily Mars roundups But it wasn t even the truth The truth was that both Earth people and Martians were observing Landing Day with the usual fuss but that it was all a big masquerade The oldtime distrust of Terrestrials that had come with the first spaceship was still there It had never been completely wiped out The only ones being taken in were the people back home who knew nothing about Mars except what they were told by people like Scott Warren and who usually saw it only as a red pinpoint in the sky if the weather happened to be right When he got to thinking this way Scott Warren felt more like a propagandist for World Government than a newsman the chief of the Mars bureau of Galactic News He wished he could tell them the truth a truth not dictated by Policy Some day he d write a book That was what all newsmen said wasn t it The truth would have gone something like this The distrust Martians have for Earth people yes that includes you dear friends of the reading listening and viewing audience wasn t completely wiped out even when World Government corrected its first monumental blunder Oh yes W G has made blunders and the first was a whooperdoo ladies gentlemen and prodigies a whooperdoo of the first order a dilly whose details still are skirted when we talk about it because they re very very embarrassing The first spaceship you see dealt naturally enough with those who had seemed to be the rulers of Mars if not the duly elected representatives of the pee pul And so did the Earth emissaries who followed These Martians in the welcoming party were a crafty race stockily built with oversized heads like granite hard bargaining and double crossing Rockheads we called them and still do underestimating them As our politicians point out with pride there has been no colonization of Mars as such Not even despite the cries of the imperialists back home And there has been no war you will remember although for a while it was touch and go Among the first to come from Earth were the World Government commissions C E A exploration and assessment C E D economic development C I I industrial integration C H W came later health and welfare And so did C I E information and education It all worked very smoothly Mars you remember was the goal of space flight for half a century ever since the pioneer hop to the icy rock of the moon and the planning commission had it all set up in advance from Martian Relations right down to War Planning top secret in the if necessary category But Earth muffed it and good The Rockheads of Mars who met the spaceship and whose delegations worked with the Earth emissaries were intelligent people true but they were the fascists of Mars What World Government didn t know and couldn t have known was that there had been a military revolution on the red planet a short ten years before the first spaceship landed and that in that revolution the democratic government of the planet was overthrown and its leaders killed or banished Scott Warren took an imaginary sip of water and paced up and down his imaginary lecture platform He pointed a finger at his imaginary classroom The big shots of W G had found out about it of course It didn t take them too long Only about two years went by before they were convinced of what had happened and they had had suspicion of it long before But it took W G twenty years to do anything about it Twenty years mind you when the average lifespan of a Martian is forty Of course there were reasons Good sound diplomatic reasons In the first place it would have been embarrassing to act sooner There had been such hoopla and ballyhoo during the first negotiations with the Rockheads so many grandiose statements and telepix of interplanetary amity that to have confessed then would have been diplomatic suicide or so they thought So the fiction had been maintained Not only maintained but magnified and distorted So bad did the distortion become that the people back home had almost no inkling of the difficulties in negotiation of the many concessions Earth had to make to Mars totalitarian rulers They didn t know how many insults the Earth envoys had to swallow or of the innumerable conferences that ended in deadlock because of the Rockheads impossible demands demands made to impress their own subject people with their might or of the W G investigators who were imprisoned because they had stumbled across some particularly noisome secret of the corrupt Martian government Scott was getting quite wound up He was pointing a finger again when the door opened His finger paralyzed in midair The thing that entered was taller than he The entire upper half of it was a face An idiotically grinning white toothed face Its eyes were outlined in black and its lips were an oversized red A caricature of a woman s face with a great mass of blonde hair coiled fantastically above What the hell said Scott The figure bent forward and the huge mask came off Hello Scott a girl said My Terrestrial aunt said Scott Ylia She was a Martian the daughter of one of the subcommissioners of her government Ylia wasn t pretty by any Earth standard She had the big head of her race the stocky body and the flat face But she was esteemed by the Martians as attractive as far as looks count on that planet Why the mask asked Scott I didn t think you went in for all this brothers together nonsense Everybody s masked tonight she said meaning all the women I had to see you and I thought I d attract less attention if I wore one too Scott knew what the masks represented They were brought out every Landing Day and worn in the streets for the traditional celebrations The masks were all of women Earth women Few Earth women had come to Mars but Earth s advertising had come as soon as the planet was opened to trade And with the ads had come the art which hadn t changed in centuries A pretty face it was reasoned if there was any reasoning ought to sell as much soap or cigarettes on Mars as it had on Earth Hence the masks representing Earth s greatest contribution thus far to the culture of its neighboring planet advertising and the female face What s up Ylia Scott asked We re having a meeting sort of and Father would like you to come if you can Why sure he said When is it Anytime you get there You see you re sort of part of it Will there be anything I can use in the roundup Scott asked There s nothing in it so far except color stuff on Landing Day It has to go off in a few hours You re the newsman Ylia said Why not come and see Good enough he said There s something Father would like you to bring with you I don t usually carry a gun said Scott but I guess I could scrounge one up if I had to Nothing like that I think you have what he needs right in your files The Green Arrow affair You do have it don t you Of course We have copies of all the stories on it that Galactic sent out I can dig them up in a couple of minutes No said Ylia Not that part of it What we want is the information you didn t send out Oh said Scott The Green Arrow was the name the news services had given a guerrilla leader who d spearheaded the resistance movement against the Rockheads before World Government had got around to any definite action The name came from a chalk symbol he had left behind him after each raid or foray Around the Green Arrow had rallied a handful of partisans who had not been content with W G s slow and not so sure methods of deposing the Rockhead regime They were men of ideals and more than that of action Somewhere in the desert below Syrtis had been the Arrow s headquarters All the punitive expeditions of the Rockheads had failed to find him No one had known who he was On the rare occasions that an Arrow man was captured no amount of torture could get a single secret from him The damage the Green Arrow did to the Rockheads was negligible in its overall effect But he had been more than a night raider he d been a symbol to the people in the Rockhead yoke that someone was actively on their side There was a tremendous lift in spirit each time the Arrow hit a Rockhead target and for days thereafter people in the community where he had struck and in others too were more cocky and less cooperative than the Rockheads thought they had a right to be The Arrow s raids sparked slow down movements and some sabotage and evoked Rockhead reprisals against guilty and innocent alike Some of the reprisals were cruel so cruel that they would have deterred a less determined man but the Green Arrow was not to be swayed He remained even after he was captured and executed a symbol of liberty in a land which had not tasted such a blessing for years Galactic News had covered the Green Arrow story from start to finish G N gave it the full treatment despite threats from the Rockheads and the denial to it of certain newsgathering facilities More than that Scott Warren got permission from G N s New York headquarters to send a man out to interview the Arrow The reporter got through where all the anti partisan forces of the Rockheads had failed and interviewed the Arrow in his desert headquarters That interview was the journalistic beat of the year and was highly embarrassing to the Rockheads Shortly thereafter the reporter was arrested by the Rockhead secret police and it took all the influence of World Government to have him released The name of that reporter was George Mercer He was now covering the Martian parliament for Galactic News There had been more in Mercer s story than had been made public however Before Galactic broke the story it went with it to W G A high diplomatic official there in the interests of security asked G N to withhold one fact and Galactic agreed As things turned out it was nothing W G hadn t known but something in the nature of a politico military secret It was the name of the Green Arrow Scott Warren knew what the name was but it meant nothing to him He got Mercer s original story out of the files it had once been kept in a safe and put it in an inside pocket This used to be classified material he said to the girl It s not any more I don t know why you want it Ylia smiled Are you ready to go He nodded She put the grotesque mask on again and the two of them left the building Ylia s father was Kring a sub commissioner of commerce in the government of President Murain The news services had begun the custom of transliterating Martian names into pronounceable English the W G language and W G itself later adopted it Murain was a symbol of World Government s diplomatic triumph as Earth chose to regard it For two decades the dirty political game of collaboration with the Rockheads had been played although it was on such a high level that diplomacy was considered the proper word It ended finally with free elections the first since the military coup The elections were the result of W G s long psychological siege against the Rockheads The men from Earth played on the vanity of the complacent dictators until they believed they could be the people s choice voluntarily It was a masterpiece Scott had to admit but a masterpiece of striped pants double cross On the one hand the Earthmen pumped up the egos of the Rockheads and on the other they smuggled the democratic leaders those who still lived out of their desert Siberias and let them talk to the people in thousands of small indoor gatherings The people anywhere whether it s in Iopa or Middletown are smart if they have the facts These people went to the polls and booted the Rockheads out It was close and there was some violence when W G watchers arrested repeaters from the Rockheads machine but the dictatorship went down in a relatively peaceful manner The democratic coup evoked a singing story from Scott Warren who was then newly assigned to the post of Mars bureau chief The story won him a journalistic prize The election also provoked a counter revolution by the Rockheads which had to be put down by World Government s police troops That was another story and it won Scott a rest leave on Earth which he cut short to get back to the news beat which he found strangely he had an unaccountable hankering for And so democratic government returned to Mars and everything was dandy for a while Scott and Ylia pushed their way through the celebrating crowds The big grinning masks of Earth women were moving chaotically idiotically all around them Spotlights which were partly heat lamps played over the throng in their many colors coloring and warming the night scene Musicians in outlandish costumes circulated in groups of three or four their reedy tunes conflicting and yet mingling in a pleasing semi harmony Most of the crowds were Martians but here and there a party of Earth people was taking part in the gaiety In the warm glow of one big spotlight an Earthman was dancing with a Martian girl her mask and his fantastic steps parodying a popular Terrestrial ballroom team Suddenly there was an intrusion into this scene of celebration From a side street into the main square which Scott and Ylia were now going through there came a knot of people They came on slowly about a dozen of them their steady progress in contrast to the aimless carefree motions of the rest Their faces were serious and the group held both Martians and Earthmen They were young old faces young in age but old in their apparent contempt for the scene all round them The group remained close together not costumed and when a reveler pulled at the sleeve of one in invitation to join a chain dance he was pushed away brusquely almost angrily When the group reached a well lighted position near the center of the square its members formed themselves into a tight circle They pulled signs from beneath their tunics and thrust them up then began moving in a shuffling lockstep chanting discordantly They were pickets serious almost fanatic young men of two planets bound together in their cause Their signs read Down with the Earth Imperialists Democracy Not Mockery What are you Celebrating Colonization and so on They chanted the same things out of unison so that their voices created a nerve tingling atmosphere of unrest They shouted defiantly yet not looking anywhere but at the neck of the man directly ahead in the revolving picket line Reds Picket Landing Day Fete Scott said to himself thinking in headline terms There was tension now among the celebrants in this part of the square This was not a time for problems or for thinking about them and those who had gathered to have fun were being robbed of their spree Abruptly a Martian stepped up and in a quick motion wrested a sign from one of the pickets He ripped it up and danced on the pieces The picket whose sign had been snatched made no protest aside from a look of surprise and a frown He stayed in ranks and the circle continued to go round Cheers went up and other revelers pressed forward The marchers tightened their ranks and took firmer grips on their signs The Martian who had snatched the first was now conferring with others He motioned to a group of silently standing musicians and they took up a tune The music was rousing and patriotic and some costumed Martians went into a wild snake dance With apparent good humor but with telling effect they drove into the circle of pickets and split them into two groups In the scramble several more signs were trampled underfoot More revelers joined the attack and the pickets were split again until they were widely separated and all their signs were gone Their unity lost they disappeared in the crowd The musicians switched to a gayer tune and there were cheers and laughter The Martian who had grabbed down the first sign was hoisted into the air where he bowed his over sized head grinning The interruption of the fun was ended and without violence Scott and Ylia moved on But Scott knew the picketing had been only one manifestation of a smoldering problem There was truth in those signs and the people knew it They just hadn t wanted to be reminded of it now And besides most of them didn t want their thinking done for them by the left wingers who proclaimed the right of the people but too often in history had aborted the very rights they spoke of so feelingly The limited democracy the people now enjoyed had been hard won It was not perfect they knew and they suspected that there was corruption here and there either in their own government or in W G But the Martian people had had a bellyful of violence The force used by the Rockheads just lately overthrown in a peaceful election was fresh in their minds and they were willing to go along for a while with President Murain at least to give him a chance They trusted Murain He was one of them But Scott was aware that Murain himself was too trusting The Martian president was a grateful man and his gratitude had made him less suspicious than a politician should be Where the Rockheads had driven hard bargains with Earth Murain s representatives drove none at all They trusted their deliverers the men of W G to do the right thing And the Earthmen some of them were doing the right thing but for themselves Where the Martian democratic government had once lost to the fascists through force it was now losing to friends who were rooking it in a perfectly legitimate businesslike way The Commission on Exploration and Assessment had now become known off the record as A E assessment and exploitation The business and industries which should have made the Martians prosper which should have given them the schools and housing they had been robbed of by the Rockheads these had their profits skimmed off and sent to Earth The Martians had their freedom now true but they couldn t eat it or build with it Ylia pulled at Scott s sleeve They turned down a side street and at an old stone house that seemed as ancient as Mars itself she led him through an archway and into a court She knocked at a door and when it opened took off her ridiculous mask and entered beckoning Scott to follow They entered a room that was low and wide furnished with a mixture of Earth and Mars styles including some of those chairs which are geared to Martian dimensions oversized headrest and between closely spaced arms a seat that a plump Terrestrial either had to squeeze into or avoid Of the three people in the room Scott recognized two Kring Ylia s father and Toby Black a W G investigator whose real job was known to only a few and who posed as a sales manager for a construction firm The guise enabled him to be places where the presence of a W G representative would be unwelcome Here possibly The other Martian in the room looked familiar but Scott couldn t place him Scott shook hands with Kring and let himself be introduced to Toby although they d had many a drink together in the Press Club bar and in less respectable places And this is Mr Rastol Kring said of the familiar looking Martian Then Scott remembered Two days ago President Murain had decided on a man to fill the job of commerce minister in the Martian government a post vacated through the death of a cabinet member Murain had offered the job to Rastol Scott had no idea what had prompted the offer He felt sure that Murain hadn t acted of his own free choice pressure must have been brought on him Apparently it was a concession he felt it necessary to make a sort of horse trade with some powerful leader in Parliament to get an administration bill through All Scott knew now that he remembered was that Rastol was a Rockhead Not an overt one true There was no blood on his hands as far as anyone could prove But Rastol had been a power in the totalitarian government lately voted out Possibly Murain could find no one else for the job Rastol had ability of course but he also had a tinge if not a definite odor He had been brought to trial under a W G indictment but had been acquitted of complicity in any of the really unsavory doings of the Rockhead regime Some had said it was lack of evidence but newsmen covering the trial had a strong suspicion that several prosecution witnesses had been given bank accounts And Rastol went free And now Murain was offering him the big commerce job one that held the purse strings of a fair share of the Martian budget The post would give Rastol the power to spend to let contracts to make loans and parcel out a tremendous amount of business That money could go to help the economy of Mars back on its feet or it could be pork barreled into the coffers of firms whose ties with the Rockheads had been only nominally broken Rastol s acceptance of the job not yet forthcoming and his confirmation in it by Parliament would be a kick in the teeth to Martian democracy The reason for this off in the corner Landing Day soiree became a little clearer although Scott still was unable to figure out why he d been invited Scott shook the hand Rastol extended and said something noncommittal Most Martians looked almost alike to Earth s eyes except for their sex differences but Rastol was distinctive He was corpulent a thing most Martians were not and he was hairless which also was unusual His skin was whiter than that of most of his planetmen and he had no neck to speak of If Scott had been a caricaturist he d have drawn Rastol as an egg Ylia had left the room She came back now with a tray and served drinks Scott took one of the small pottery cups and told himself he mustn t drink more than two of them They contained a syrupy blue liquid with the kick of a rocket exhaust Kring raised his cup To the Republic he said They all sipped their drinks I ve asked you here Kring said for a purpose I should not have chosen Landing Day if it had not been important Some of you have very generously broken other engagements or left your work he bowed to Scott to be here Rastol spoke in a low resonant voice It is an honor to be asked to your home Mr Kring The mister was something Earthmen had brought Mars before the Rockheads set up their semi feudal system had had no such term of address Kring bowed again I am especially happy that you were able to come Mr Rastol because what I have to say should be of particular interest to you He turned to Toby Black You Mr Black are interested in construction of course and Mr Warren s news service has an interest in something similar reconstruction So we are well met Scott didn t know what this preamble was leading to but he wished Kring would get on with it He did Mr Warren Kring went on may also have a news story of some value You see before Mr Rastol leaves this room tonight he will have announced that he cannot accept the post of minister of commerce in the Murain government Rastol didn t move except for a narrowing of his eyes Then he said carefully Indeed Kring smiled a little Yes he said I think Mr Rastol will find that his private affairs are of such a demanding nature that he will be forced regretfully to decline the honor tendered by President Murain Rastol said evenly I hesitate to differ with my gracious host but it would seem to me that an individual might be considered to know his own affairs better than another I am sure said Kring that no one knows your affairs better than you Mr Rastol Scott looked at Toby Black who had leaned forward in his chair as if trying to see the significance of it all Scott knew that Toby knew as much about Rastol as anyone and probably more Toby was one of half a dozen men who were permitted to ride the private elevator to the private office of the director general of World Government Rastol looked at a timepiece on the wall and rose from his chair I am afraid I must say good night I had hoped to be better company but I have just remembered an appointment Please sit down Mr Rastol said Kring We have much more to discuss Rastol moved toward the door Ylia stepped in front of it She had a Q gun in her hand I am quite proud of my daughter s marksmanship said Kring She is the equal of any soldier at hitting a target At short range she never misses by so much as a hair Rastol sat down He sipped his drink and appeared to relax Be good enough to tell me he said why you think I would be so lacking in a sense of public duty as to reject an assignment to which my government has called me The answer is simple said Kring The Murain government is not your government Your allegiance is to the totalitarian movement I think the public record will show the falsehood of that statement said Rastol The trial to which I was so cruelly subjected proved just the opposite You will recall that the verdict was one of acquittal Only said Kring because some witnesses were bribed and others were murdered Rastol smiled thinly Your proof Kring smiled also Of that None I admit But we have proof of other things things without value in a court of law perhaps but which may persuade you to retire to private life for your tranquillity of mind Produce them said Rastol He was a cool one Scott had to admit Then the newsman realized that Kring was looking at him Mr Warren he said if you will be so kind And he held out his hand Scott gave him the papers he had brought from the office He had no idea what bearing they had on the situation now being unfolded Kring broke the seal on the envelope and opened it He looked through the news reports those which had been used and those which hadn t Finally he found what he was looking for You have heard of the Green Arrow Kring asked Rastol Of course A bandit and outlaw who achieved some notoriety What of him You may not have heard said Kring that his real name became known To myself and some others who cared to ask after it was no longer a guarded secret His name was Acton Kring looked closely at Rastol The big Martian gave no flicker of recognition A not uncommon name said Rastol Acton was the name of your son was it not There was silence in the room Kring s eyes looked steadily into Rastol s Ylia stood at the door her gun no longer pointing at the guest but down at her side Toby Black was stopped with a cigarette halfway to his lips Scott raised a hand to brush away what he thought might be an insect on the back of his neck There was nothing there it was part of the tension Kring spoke again Was not Acton the name of your son and did he not fight against you and the things you stood for Rastol s eyes went from one to another in the room He made no other movement Even his breathing was not apparent At length he said Yes Acton was my son Kring s breath came hard as if he had been holding it Then Rastol added But what of that Really gentlemen this is a most ridiculous performance To bring me to this house to threaten me with weapons and with words and to produce mysterious papers with the flourish of a wandering mystic this is childish I must ask you to excuse me I have an important letter to write President Murain What will the letter say It will say that I accept humbly yet with pride that I have been chosen the position of minister of commerce in the government to which I owe allegiance and wish to serve to the best of my poor ability Allegiance Kring spat the word You speak of allegiance who have never known it to anything decent and honorable You blaspheme the memory of your son s great deeds when you use the word Neither my son nor any creature that crawls on the ground has any bearing on my decision Your threats and blackmail are unworthy of you Mr Kring And if you persist in this farce or seek to use your information publicly I shall be forced to make a noisy and patriotic speech which will look incongruous in my biography but which will have the stupid public applauding from the galleries I shall say that as an older man I believed in gradual change and that no man was happier than I when Mars became a republic under the aegis of World Government I shall say if I am forced to that of course I had publicly deplored the activities of the man called the Green Arrow but that I was in good company for did not Mr Murain then not yet President Murain of the Republic to be also plead for peaceful methods of achieving freedom and urge his followers to shun violence And if someone is so unfeeling as to mention that Acton was my son could not my impatience with his activities have been in reality a father s fears for the life of the boy he had loved from the cradle Oh I shall make them weep Mr Kring and your petty plan will come to nothing Furthermore I shall demand your resignation as a sub commissioner of commerce and I have little doubt that I shall receive it You are an excellent man with a speech said Kring That I admit But there is more which you pretend not to know Is there Much more You may or may not choose to recall Druro Rastol chose to say nothing Druro had been one of the blackest marks against the Rockhead regime It was the name of an infamous concentration camp in which thousands of prisoners had died of malnutrition and overwork and thousands more had been put to death because of their political views I can tell you something about Druro said Toby Black I was there as a guest of your government the Rockhead government is the one I m talking about Rastol not the one you claim you re suddenly so fond of Toby put out his cigarette and leaned forward His thin face got hard Kring is a gentleman even when he s dealing with a louse Rastol but I m no diplomat I m just a hardheaded old trader from Earth and maybe some people think my language is crude But I say what I think and I don t like you and your kind Usually I don t mix in politics my business is construction I started when I was a young squirt and built things with my hands and they got calloused Now I sit in a fine office and scoot around in a fine air car and other men do the dirty work But that s honest work The dirty work I can t stomach is your kind Rastol and since I ve got the chance to undo some of it or maybe prevent some more of it I asked Kring to let me speak my piece Scott could easily have been persuaded if he hadn t known better that World Government Investigator Toby Black was just that rockribbed businessman with a conscience that he was pretending to be Toby went on The reason I saw Druro the way mighty few people saw it was that somebody slipped up Druro was also a factory town and there was room there for a new plant God knows you had enough slave labor to make it damned profitable So I was invited by your Rockheads to look over parts of the town so my company could make a bid on building the plant they wanted But I saw more than you fascists intended Rastol I m an old country boy and I get up early One day I got up earlier than those gorillas who were supposed to tag around with me to keep my nose clean And my nose got good and dirty Rastol The stench of Druro is still in it I got out and talked to the people in town and the people had plenty to tell me about that camp just over the hill Some of the people I spoke to had been inside it and they knew what they were talking about An interesting anecdote Mr Black Rastol interrupted but I must confess that I see no relevance Toby lighted a cigarette and spat out the smoke The relevance is coming right up I heard a lot of different things about Druro from a lot of different people but one of the things I heard over and over again was the same It was the name of the man whose signature sent those thousands to their death I don t have to tell you Rastol what that name was You sign your letters with it every day You can prove nothing snapped Rastol his composure jolted for the first time It would be your word against mine and why should anyone believe you That s true said Toby There s no proof After I heard of your acquittal I got good and mad about it and I made a special trip to see if I could find some of those people I d talked to back then to get affidavits if they wouldn t testify in person to get new evidence But you and your Rockheads did a good job all right You practically wiped out Druro There wasn t a soul left who would testify against you or any other fascist You see You have no proof No said Kring no proof that would be good in court But everyone in this room now is convinced of your guilt That must be a terrible burden on your conscience If I were you I should welcome this opportunity to make some slight amend I appeal to you Mr Rastol to decline the post of commerce minister Rastol laughed You appeal You beg This is the weakness of your system You yourselves are so weak that your government cannot be strong I know now that the threats against me tonight all were psychological Even that Q gun in your daughter s hands You would not shoot me It is against your principles Fortunately I have no principles and after I have become commerce minister there will be others like me in the cabinet And then it will not be long before Mars again has the kind of government a planet like this needs Now I am going and if any of you decides to remember any of this in public I shall deny it And then who do you think will be believed Stand aside young lady I am leaving Rastol got up from his chair This wasn t Scott s show but he spoke up anyway It looked as if everything else had failed He said I have quite a story here Rastol I haven t been taking notes but they say I have a stenographic ear Rastol whirled on him Use it and I ll sue you and Galactic News Service for libel and everything else in the statutes I ll deny everything and produce two witnesses for every one of yours You re not dealing with an amateur young man And now I say good night you fools Kring moved to stand beside his daughter There is yet more he said We had hoped to spare you this although I know now that our concern for your feelings was misguided There is no more said Rastol You have bluffed and you have lost He whipped his hand through the air Stand aside I am going Stay said a new voice Rastol turned slowly At the end of the room opposite the door some hangings had parted Through them from another room had come a tall cloaked Martian a young man Rastol looked at him under a wrinkled forehead Who are you he asked Hello Father said Acton Rastol peered across the room His face seemed to come apart It went slack seemed to turn gray You re dead cried Rastol This is a trick A disguise Turn up the lights Acton stepped forward to within a foot of the older man Look well he said Is it a disguise But you re dead I know you re dead I Yes Father I should be Acton s eyes were steady but without hate They looked hurt and pitying I was at Druro and you signed the order for my execution yourself It was carried out you thought and the last witness against you was stilled You thought The young man threw back his cloak He had no left arm They took me for dead The Q rays burned away my arm and I fell with the others I was buried among the corpses But my friends found me later There wasn t much life in me but they nourished it and I am here No screamed Rastol It s not true It s a lie Illustration No screamed Rastol It s not true it s a lie He wavered away from his son s gaze and half fell into a chair You deny it said Acton Come we ll tell the people They will decide We ll go to the great square and ask them whom they believe Rastol or the Green Arrow No said Rastol No no Back in the Galactic News Service bureau Scott Warren came to the last paragraph of Today on Mars He had written his quota of words about Landing Day and the speeches and parades and carnival He had a story bigger than any of this of course but he couldn t use it Toby Black asked him not to not yet Rastol had declined Acton s challenge to go before the people There in Kring s house under the hard eyes of his son Rastol had written a letter to President Murain and signed it The rest would come later It took time to get the legal wheels in motion to prepare a genocide case but although World Government moved slowly sometimes it did move In two months or three or six Rastol would be indicted and tried and this time there would be no doubt of the verdict In the meantime Scott wrote Elsewhere on Mars these things happened Fire broke out in Senalla driving fifty persons from their homes No one was injured but damage to the apartment house block was extensive A collision between two air cars sent three persons to the hospital in Iopa with critical injuries A sandstorm blowing across the desert miles northeast of Iopa has cut communications with the town of Ramor And Rastol decided against accepting the post of commerce minister which had been offered to him by President Murain Rastol said he was honored by the offer but that the pressure of private affairs made it impossible for him to accept Scott Warren typed at the end of his copy and sent it off to Interradio for transmission to Earth He resigned himself to the possibility that the night desk in the New York bureau would cut out his last paragraph to save space END OF THE

aqua forti THE most notable ANTIQUITY OF GREAT BRITAIN vulgarly called STONE HENG ON SALISBURY PLAIN RESTORED By INIGO JONES Esquire Architect Generall to the late KING LONDON Printed by James Flesher for Daniel Pakeman at the sign of the Rainbow in Fleetstreet and Laurence Chapman next door to the Fountain Tavern in the Strand TO The Right Honourable PHILIP Earle of Pembroke and Montgomerie Baron Herbert of Caerdiff and Sherland Lord Parr and Rosse of Kendall Lo Fitzhugh Marmyon and Saint Quintin c STONE HENG restored is humbly dedicated by Your Lo devoted servant John Webb TO THE FAVOURERS OF ANTIQUITY This Discourse of Stone heng is moulded off and cast into a rude Form from some few indigested notes of the late judicious Architect the Vitruvius of his age Inigo Jones That so venerable an Antiquity might not perish but the world made beholding to him for restoring it to light the desires of severall his learned Friends have encouraged me to compose this Treatise Had he survived to have done it with his own hand there had needed no Apology Such as it is I make now yours Accept it in his name from J W STONEHENG RESTORED BY INIGO JONES Esquire Being naturally inclined in my younger years to study the Arts of Designe I passed into forrain parts to converse with the great Masters thereof in Italy where I applied my self to search out the ruines of those ancient Buildings which in despight of Time it self and violence of Barbarians are yet remaining Having satisfied my self in these and returning to my native Countrey I applied my minde more particularly to the study of Architecture Among the ancient monuments whereof found here I deemed none more worthy the searching after then this of Stoneheng not only in regard of the Founders thereof the Time when built the Work it self but also for the rarity of its Invention being different in Forme from all I had seen before likewise of as beautifull Proportions as elegant in Order and as stately in Aspect as any King James in his progresse the year one thousand six hundred and twenty being at Wilton and discoursing of this Antiquity I was sent for by the right Honourable William then Earl of Pembrook and received there his Majesties commands to produce out of mine own practise in Architecture and experience in Antiquities abroad what possibly I could discover concerning this of Stoneheng What mine opinion was then and what I have since collected in relation thereunto I intend to make the subject of this present Treatise And certainly in the intricate and obscure study of Antiquity it is far easier as Camden very well observes to refute and contradict a false then to set down a true and certain resolution For mine own part in what I shall here deliver I intend not to struggle against any opinion commonly and long since received Let every man judge as it pleaseth him What opinion soever the Reader inclines to I shall not make much materiall my aime being a desire only to vindicate as much as in me lies the Founders of this venerable Antiquity from oblivion and to make the truth as far forth as possibly I may appeare to all men Severall Writers both Strangers and our own Countreymen have treated of Stoneheng Before recite whole opinions I think not amisse to seek this subject from the most ancient times endevouring thereby to give satisfaction whether or no the Druides ali s Druid in Authors indifferently written and in old time the Priests of the Britans and Gauls or the ancient Britans for the Druid s use might not be the Founders of so notable a monument which if they were there is then no cause why bestow farther study or pains in searching who the Founders were but acquiesce in the honour of our own Nations first erection of it As far neverthelesse as from History ancient or moderne may be gathered there is little likelyhood of any such matter considering especially what the Druid s were also what small experience the Britans anciently inhabiting this Isle had in knowledge of what ever Arts much lesse of building with like elegancy and proportion such goodly works as Stoneheng Sidenote C sar Commen lib Sidenote Plin lib Concerning the Druid s in the first place true it is they are reported in ancient times to have been in great esteeme in this Island where their discipline and manner of learning was supposed to be first invented and from hence translated into Gaul Disciplina in Britannia reperta saith C sar atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur They are said in like manner no have ordered and disposed all divine matters as well in relation to their severall kinds of Sacrifices as to expounding whatever rites of their idolatrous superstition insomuch you may call them if you please the Bishops and Clergy of that Age Sidenote Strab lib Sidenote C sar lib Their power moreover and preheminence was not confined within the strict limits of sacred matters but enjoying a more large prerogative temporall negotiations and affairs of State were transacted by them the managing of Peace and War was usually remitted to their Authority even when Armies were ready to joyn in Battell Publica iis saith Strabo privata judicia committuntur aliquando causis bellorum disceptandis jam acie congressuros composuerunt Judges they were saith C sar also in almost all civill and criminall causes sentence they gave in case of life and death decide they did controversies and debates betwixt party and party finally whatever else was requisite and convenient to keep the people in due obedience to their Princes they wholly took the care and charge of Sidenote Vitr li These were the maine affaires wherein the employment of the Druides consisted and whereunto they wholly addicted themselves Whosoever desires to know more of them may read C sar Diodorus Siculus Strabo Pliny Diogenes Laertius Ammianus Marcellinus and such like ancient Authors But whatsoever these or other Historians have written of the Druides certainly Stoneheng could not be builded by them in regard I find no mention they were at any time either studious in Architecture which in this subject is chiefly to be respected or skilfull in any thing else conducing thereunto For Academies of Designe were unknown unto them publique Lectures in the Mathematiques not read amongst them nothing of their Painting not one word of their Sculpture is to be found or scarce of any Science Philosophy and Astronomy excepted proper to informe the judgement of an Architect who as Vitruvius saith should be peritus Graphidos eruditus Geometria Optices non ignarus c perfect in Designe expert in Geometry well seen in the Opticks skilfull in Arithmetick a good Historian a diligent hearer of Philosophers well experienced in Physick Musick Law and Astrologie Sidenote C sar li Of all that have written of the Druid s no Author knew them better then C sar neither hath any more fully described them who after a large discourse of their discipline priviledges and Theologie Multa de sideribus saith he atque eorum motu de mundi ac terrarum magnitudine de rerum natura c disputant juventuti transdunt They make much dispute and instruct their Scholars in many things concerning the Stars and their motion the greatnesse of Heaven and Earth of the nature of things c As for other Arts relating to the Mathematiques or any works of this kind he makes no manner of mention though himself an Architect glorying in his own and much more extolling others invention in that Art The truth is those ancient times had no knowledge of publique works either Sacred or Secular for their own use or honour of their Deities Besides they us d not any buildings of Stone or for ought is manifest knew so much as how to order working therein The Druid s led a solitary contemplative life contenting themselves with such habitations as either meer necessity invented to shelter them from contrariety of seasons without Art without Order without any whatever means tending to perpetuity or such as Nature alone had prepared for them in dens and caves of desert and darksome woods esteeming it questionlesse the highest secret of their mystery rather to command in caves and cottages then live like Kings in Palaces and stately houses They were too wise knew too well twas their humility integrity retired manner of life and pretended sanctity possest the people with an awfully reverend esteem of them and which fed and kept up their reputation throughout the Countrey when outward appearances of State and magnificence would either have brought them into envy and their superstition into contempt or themselves and Religion both to be wholly extirpated and laid aside Sidenote Pomp Mela lib Pomponius Mela discoursing of the Druides Docent multa saith he nobilissimos gentis clam diu vicenis annis in specu aut in abditis saltibus They teach the Nobility and better sort of their nation many things even twenty years together secretly in caves or close coverts of obscure woods and forrests Such and no other were their habitations such their Universities and publique Schooles Sidenote Pliny lib As for their Temples and sacred structures they consisted not in variety of formes costlinesse of materials or perfection of humane Arts but were of Natures own framing in like manner being no other then groves of Oke The Druid s chose of purpose saith Pliny such groves for their divine Service as stood only upon Okes nay they solemnized no Sacrifice nor performed any sacred Ceremonies without the branches and leaves thereof from whence they may seem well enough to be named Dryad in Greek which signifies as much as Oke Priests Sidenote Tacit Ann lib The Romans having forced their passage and gained victory over the Druid s in Anglesey cut down their woods and groves amongst them reckoned holy and consecrated to their execrable superstitions Excisi luci saith Tacitus s vis superstitionibus sacri To this purpose Humphrey Lloid in his history of Wales The vast woods growing in that Island were not only by the Romans but afterwards when the Christian Faith took place in this Nation by the Christians also fell d and rooted out And why because of the idolatry saith he and absurd Religion used in them Again in his Epistle to Ortelius concerning the Isle of Anglesey the same Author affirmes Though there is little wood now growing there yet every day the roots and bodies of huge trees of a wonderfull length and bignesse are by the inhabitants found and digged out of the earth in divers places in low grounds and champion fields Now if in stead of these roots and bodies of trees the ruines of ancient Structures had been there found it might peradventure with some probability have been presumed either that the Druid s used Temples or some other buildings of stone For their ancient seat was in the Isle of Mona now Anglesey whence modern Writers style it Insulam Druidum the Island of the Druid s and sedem Druidum the seat of the Druid s And from hence questionlesse it came to passe the Romans with such difficulty under the conduct of Suetonius Paulinus brought that Island under their power nor was it wholly subdued to their Empire untill Julius Agricola s time For whereas in other parts of Britain the people contended for Liberty only there they fought pro aris focis for Liberty and Religion both Sidenote Tacit Ann lib There it was the British armies saith Tacitus being imbattailed the women ran to and fro amongst them in sable weeds their hair about their ears and fire brands in their hands like infernall furies the Druid s round about them also lifting up their hands to Heaven and pouring forth deadly curses the novelty of which sight bred such amazement in the Roman Legions the Romans here it seems were unacquainted with the Druid s till then that they stood stock still and close together not once moving a foot as if possessed with a resolution to act nothing at all but receive their deaths tamely and without any great resistance Wherefore besides that History hath not remembred the ruines of any ancient buildings digged up in Anglesey if either this Antiquity had been remaining in that Island or any Author delivered such Actions of the Druid s as aforesaid performed about the place where Stoneheng remains standing there might have been some advantage made thereof to the purpose now in hand But Anglesey excepted ancient Writers give them residence in no part of Britain beside nor are they remembred by any to have been found elswhere throughout the whole Nation With respect whereunto if the Druid s had knowledge either to build the like magnificent structures or use for any such they would without all peradventure have erected them upon the same place rather where themselves resided then elswhere Sidenote C s Com lib Neither are we to wonder they chose such an out nook or corner as Anglesey to reside in in regard there they lived remote and solitary there were store of caves and dens to instruct their Scholars in close and retired places for their own habitations and plenty of groves to perform their sacred mysteries in Moreover they past their days there like the Hermits of old time according to their own desire in full contentment and with free liberty to study and contemplate what they pleased For Anglesey we must know in those times of yore was wholly overgrown with desert Woods and obscure forrests from whence the ancient Britans call d it Ynis Dowil the shadowy or dark Island Which name it still retains and is well known thereby to the now inhabitants who are even at this day likewise enclined yea they usually accustome themselves to commit things more to Memory then Writing and as having received it by tradition from their Ancestors living in those ancient times still endevour to observe that custom of the Druid s who held it unlawfull to commit any thing to writing As C sar in the sixth book of his Commentaries of the Gaulish war delivers Concerning the Britans in the next place The condition of those ancient inhabitants of this Island in the Druid s time duly considered viz in what manner they lived how unskilfull in all Sciences and civill customs what Deities they had in what places they adored them and what manner of buildings or sacred or secular were used by them as little reason appears that this Antiquity was by them erected Sidenote Herodian lib As for their manner of living the Britans were then a savage and barbarous people knowing no use at all of garments Vestis usum non cognoscunt saith Herodian Now if destitute of the knowledge even to clothe themselves much lesse any knowledge had they to erect stately structures or such remarkable works as Stoneheng What fashions they used to adorn their bodies with the same Author tells us As a rare and rich habiliment they wore about their wasts and necks ornaments of iron saith he and did pounce and colour their bodies with sundry forms in rude manner representing severall creatures In which regard they would not be otherwise clothed lest constrain d thereby to hide such their simple though with them much esteemed bravery Sidenote Strabo li Again in other their civill customs they were no lesse rude and ignorant yea so barbarous even in things appertaining to common sustenance and whatever husbandry that as Strabo Quidam eorum ob imperitiam caseos nullos conficiant cum tamen lacte abundent alii hortos colendi aliarum partium agricultur ignari sunt Many of them though they had great plenty of milk yet their want of skill was such they knew not how to make cheese others so simple they knew not to order their gardens or orchards or any thing belonging thereunto Sidenote Dion li Sidenote Ral li c Their Countrey also then lay uncultivated no corn sown Qu vis herba radix cibus est Their food was herbs and roots saith Dion Cassius Hence Sir Walter Raleigh cals them the British Nomades And by the way it may not inappositely be observ d milk roots and fruit were the chief banquetting dishes and skins of beasts if clothed the most costly habits of our Forefathers Now who can in reason imagine that any great knowledge practice or delight of Arts and Sciences wherein the elegancy of Architecture consists should be in use or esteem amongst a people wholly devoted as I may so say and given over to such barbarity Sidenote Dion li There were then no publick roads or common high ways to passe from one place to another no constant habitations Nec m nia nec urbes Nor towns nor walls as Dion out of Xiphiline hath it much lesse Temples or other buildings made of stone composed by Art with Order and Proportion Sidenote Dion lib Moreover who cast their eies upon this Antiquity and examine the same with judgement must be enforced to confesse it erected by people grand masters in the Art of building and liberall sciences whereof the ancient Britans utterly ignorant as a Nation wholly addicted to wars never applying themselves to the study of Arts or troubling their thoughts with any excellency therein Omnis arbor domus Every tree being in stead of a house to them Sidenote Dion lib In the wars which Bunduica whom Tacitus cals Boadicia Queen of the Iceni undertook against the Romans wherein seventy thousand of their Citizens and allies perished in disdainfull contempt of the experience in Arts wherein the Romans flourished She accounted it her chiefest glory saith Dion Cassius to command over the Britans in regard a people they were who had not learned or knew what belonged to the cultivating and manuring of lands or the practice of Arts or to be craftsmen in any thing save war Qui non agros colere non opifices esse sed bella gerere optim didicerunt Where you see their having nor experience nor practice in any kinde of Sciences war excepted was enforc d by Bunduica as redounding greatly to the Britans honour much advantage being made thereof by Her towards advancing Her designs as the Historian plainly tells us But certain it is however barbarous in other affairs a most warlike people they were Never untill the forces of the whole world united in the Roman Empire conspiring to subdue them liable to conquest neither could all that power till after numbers of years spent in the attempt with infinite expence of men and treasure ever prevail against them Now as their sole skilfulnesse was in war so they idoliz d principally what had relation thereunto their Dea optima maxima being Victoria whom they worshipped under the name of Andates Another Goddesse they had in much esteem called Adraste which some imagine as the Nemesis amongst the Greeks was their Goddesse of Revenge These according to their savage manner of living they adored in groves and woods the only Temples in use amongst them to perform their Sacrifices and divine mysteries in as from severall Authors I have already proved Neither find I any particular place mentioned to which any of these their Temples if they may so be called were assigned only Andates it seems from Dion Cassius had a grove sacred to her in the Countrey of the Iceni anciently containing Norfolk Suffolk Cambridge and Huntingdon Shires farre enough from Stoneheng Besides it is not to be past over in silence how Tacitus expresseth himself in the before cited fourteenth Book of his Annals telling us The Romans overthrew not the Temples or razed to the Foundations any of the sacred structures of the Druid s and Britans made of stone or other materials which he might as readily have done if they had used any such but positively the Romans cut down the Britans woods and groves amongst them reckoned holy and consecrated to their execrable superstitions True it is other Temples of greater magnificence then already spoken of I find none Ornaments of Art to enrich them they were not acquainted with such orderly composed works as Stoneheng they had not any yea no kind of sacred structures of stone were in use amongst them their idolatrous places being naturally adorned only with wild and overgrown shades designed and brought to perfection by Dame Nature her self she being Architect generall to all their Deities Nor did it consist with their vain Religion to use any other they making their worship performing their Ceremonies offering their Sacrifices in dark and obscure groves most conformable unto their barbarous and inhumane humane oblations Sidenote Mayer K Ch Sidenote Herod li Neither must it seem strange they used no other Temples then these it not being their custom alone for the Excelsi or high places mentioned in the sacred Story wherein the Heathen performed idolatrous rites unto their Idols were commonly groves affectedly sited upon some mountainous place without any House or Temple The Persians of old of whom Herodotus Neque statuas neque templa neque aras extruere consuetudo est Erected neither Images nor Temples nor Altars quinimo hoc facientibus insani tribuere accounting it great folly and madnesse in those that did but ascending to the tops of the highest and most lofty hils on them offered sacrifices to their Gods From hence Xerxes in his expedition burnt down the Temples of the Greeks because they shut up their Gods therein to whom all things are open and free and to whom the whole Universe serves for a Temple The Abasgians also inhabiting Mount Caucasus did worship even till Procopius his time groves and woods and in a barbarian simplicity esteemed the very trees themselves to be Gods In like manner the Northern and Southern people of America made all their Invocations and Exorcisms in woods The ancient Germans likewise consecrated woods and forests Lucos ac nemora consecrant saith Tacitus of them And the like places for idolatrous superstition did divers other barbarous Nations use before reduced to order and civility of life Tacitus giving this reason for it They thought it a matter ill beseeming the greatnesse of their Deities to enclose them within Temples made by Art His words are Nec cohibere parietibus Deos arbitrantur They thought it not fit to restrain their Deities within compacted walls id est neque templis neque domibus viz neither within Temples or Houses made with hands as C Pichenas commenting thereon more fully interprets Sidenote Ovid Met lib Sidenote Vitru lib Touching the manner of the buildings of the ancient Britans and of what materialls they consisted I find them so far short of the magnificence of this Antiquity that they were nor stately nor sumptuous neither had they any thing of Order or Symmetry much lesse of gracefulnesse and Decorum in them being only such as Ovid relating to the first Age of the world makes mention of domus antra fuerunt Et densi frutices junct cortice virg Thus Englished by Arthur Golding their houses were the thicks And bushy queaches hollow caves and hardles made of sticks To like purpose Vitruvius In the first Age of the World saith he men lived in woods caves and forests but after they had found out the use of fire and by the benefit thereof were invited to enter into a certain kind of society c perunt alii de fronde facere tecta alii speluncas fodere sub montibus nonnulli hirundinum nidos dificationes earum imitantes de luto virgultis facere loca qu subirent Some of them began to make themselves habitations of boughs some to dig dens in mountains other some imitating the nests of birds made themselves places of lome and twigs and such like materials to creep into and shroud themselves in Directly after which manner of workmanship were the houses of the ancient Britans Sidenote Diodo li Domos ex calamis aut lignis ut plurimum habent compactas Their houses for the most part are of reed and wood saith Diodorus Siculus In the Northern parts they live in tents Degunt in tentoriis saith Dion epitomis d by Xiphiline Sidenote Strab lib Their Cities were without walls the Country without Towns Urbium loco ipsis sunt nemora saith Strabo woods stand them in stead of Cities or Towns Arboribus enim dejectis ubi amplum circulum sepierunt ipsi casas ibidem sibi ponunt pecori stabula condunt ad usum quidem non longi temporis For when by felling of trees they have inclosed and fenced therewith a large circuit of wood therein they raise cabbins and cottages for themselves and hovels for their cattell of no great continuance but only to supply their present use and occasion Sidenote C sar lib Opidum Britanni vocant saith C sar quum silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt quo incursionis hostium vitand causa convenire consueverunt The Britans call a thick wood enclosed about with a ditch and rampire made for a place of retreat to avoid the invasion and assault of their bordering enemies a Town Thus you see in what condition the Inhabitants of this Island lived in those ancient times having of themselves neither desire nor ability to exercise nor from others encouragement to attain whatever knowledge in the Art of Building Precepts and rules therein the Druid s neither could nor would impart unto them That they could not appears from what is formerly said and in what skilfull above others they communicated nothing but to those of their own society taking speciall order as C sar affirms their discipline might not be divulged Sidenote C sar lib Sidenote Ortel descr Fr Sidenote Camden fo As for Colonies of any Nation practised in Arts from whom they might receive or knowledge or civil conversation there were none setled amongst them neither had they commerce or traffique with any people experienced therein much lesse acquaintance with any other except those of Gaul welnear as barbarous as themselves None of the Gauls in a manner had any knowledge saith C sar of the nature and quality of the people of Britain or of the places ports or passes of the Countrey Neque enim temer pr ter mercatores ill adit quisquam neque iis ipsis quidquam pr ter oram maritimam atque eas regiones qu sunt contra Galliam notum est For not any went thither without eminent danger except merchants and they also could give accompt of nothing save only the Sea coast and those Countreys which were opposite to Gaul Never any Colony of the Greeks for ought I know saith Ortelius was seated in Britain And C sar the first of all the Romans that discovered it saith Camden If desire neverthelesse to know in what times the ancient Britans began to be civilized when to learn the knowledge of Arts to build stately Temples Palaces publick Buildings to be eloquent in forrain languages and by their habits and attire attain the qualities of a civil and well ordered people Tacitus shall relate the same Sidenote Tacit in vit Agr Sequens hiems saluberrimis conciliis absumpta c The winter ensuing being the second year of Julius Agricola his Propr torship or Leivtenancy in Britan Titus Vespasian Emperour about one hundred thirty three years after the first discovery thereof by C sar was spent in most profitable and politick Councels saith Tacitus For whereas the Britans were rude and dispersed and thereby prone upon every occasion to warre Agricola to induce them by pleasure to quietnesse and rest exhorted in private and helpt them in common to build Temples Houses and places of publick resort commending those that were forward therein and punishing the refractory Moreover the Noblemens sons he took and instructed in the liberall Sciences preferring the wits of Britain to the students in Gaul as being now eagerly ambitious to attain the eloquence of the Roman tongue whereas lately they utterly rejected that language After that our attire grew in account and the gown much used amongst them and so by little and little they proceeded to provocations of vices to sumptuous galleries baths and exquisite banquettings Thus far Tacitus Now had there been but the least mention made by any Author concerning the Druid s instructing and training up the ancient Britans in any such matters as these which Tacitus remembers the Romans to have done what conclusions might have been rais d from them what presumptive reasons drawn to prove Stoneheng a work of the Druid s or at least erected for their use Sidenote Cam fo To conclude if this authority from Tacitus only an Author esteem d the Polybius of the Latines be throughly weighed it will evidently manifest whatever else hath formerly been delivered there was no such thing in Britain before the Romans arrived here as that which we now call Stoneheng What credit else with posterity could Tacitus expect to gain in affirming the Britans were taught and instructed in the liberall Sciences by the Romans if those Arts acknowledg d to be practis d amongst the Britans before What need to have told us the Romans made them skilfull in erecting sumptuous Palaces stately Portico s and publick places if the inhabitants here accustomed to enjoy such noble buildings before the Romans arrivall in this Land Why tell succeeding Ages when gentle persuasions not prevail to make the Britans innovate and admit of sacred structures to whatever Deities Agricola compelled them to found magnificent Temples and assist therein if this Antiquity Stoneheng extant before those times Why also should the Britans look upon the Temple erected by the Romans at Camalodunum supposed Maldon in Essex in honour of Claudius sacred memory as an Altar of perpetuall dominion over them if been used to such structures before yea such an eye sore the Britans accounted it as that Temple was one of the principall causes which gave birth to that fatall insurrection under Boadicia Neither would Tacitus have magnified the introducing those customs amongst them as admirable policy in Agricola and the true and only rule to bring them from their rude and dispersed manner of living to civility if the Britans attain d such discipline before or any knowledge in the excellency of Architecture preceding the time of the Romans government here No for what saith Camden It was the brightnesse of that most glorious Empire which chased away all savage Barbarism from the Britans minds like as from other Nations whom it had subdued Sidenote Cam fo Furthermore in the time of this Agricola Britain was fully discovered the Romans had circumnavigated it and knew for certain it was an Island formerly doubted of till his time yea there was not a Port as I may so say a bay mountain valley hill plain wood or forest either any custom rite ceremony or what else belonging to the knowledge of the Countrey or manners of the People but the Romans were then as well acquainted with especially in that part of the Island now call d England as at this day the Inhabitants themselves are Neverthelesse what mention soever is made by their Historians concerning other matters of the Britans not one word is to be found of this Antiquity or any building of this kind in use amongst them But because some curiously learned have desired somwhat to be spoken for their better satisfaction touching this particular I have been too prolixe In a word therefore let it suffice Stoneheng was no work of the Druid s or of the ancient Britans the learning of the Druid s consisting more in contemplation then practice and the ancient Britans accounting it their chiefest glory to be wholly ignorant in whatever Arts Neither could it be otherwise seeing their life so uncivil so rude so full of wars and consequently void of all literature as Camden relateth Yet before I come to speak of this middle Age if I may so call it wherein the Romans prevailed and to compleat their victories gave first rise to civility in this Island as I began with times of great Antiquity so must I now descend to those lesse ancient and modern wherein as posterity hath suffered an irreparable damage through want of writing in those first times so hath it been almost at as great a losse by too much writing in later times so many Authors so much contrariety so little certainty is found amongst them Who when they could not search out the truth in deed laboured to bring forth narrations invented by themselves without or reason or authority delivering saith Camden their severall opinions rather with a certain pleasant variety to give contentment to their Readers then with any care or judgement to find out the truth of things Sidenote Leyland de assert Arth fo Those ancient Historians who among other actions of the Britans treat of this Antiquity differ much in their severall reports And as it is usuall with Historiographers of other Nations where they cannot give a just and rationall accompt of unwonted accidents beyond the common course of things to fill up their stories with fabulous and incredible relations so no marvell if we hear the like in our own Histories Credibile enim est calamitatem bellicam qu ecclesias un cum bibliochecis exhauserat infinitis clara vetustatis monumenta abrasisse For evident it is through the calamities of wars saith Leyland which together with infinite Libraries ruined the Churches themselves the certain records of our Antiquities are utterly lost Unde scripturienti de antiquitate Britannica occultissima pleraque omnia Whereby the Writers of the British Stories are all of them for the most part very obscure and doubtfull Some others again especially the most ancient and authentick British Historians who liv d in Ages next succeeding those wherein Stoneheng might probably be first erected have wholly passed it over with silence In like manner venerable Bede William Malmesbury Roger Hoveden and others speak nothing thereof as happily willing rather to decline it altogether then deliver it upon frivolous conjectures and in so doing cast a blemish upon their other labours Neither is it improbable that the most ancient Authors considering the times wherein they wrote upon the first springing up of Christian Religion here might through zeal unto the true God forbear to commemorate unto posterity places designed for idolatrous uses endeavouring rather to suppresse the memory thereof and make succeeding generations sollicitous therein then in that infancy of Divine worship to illustrate the magnificence of the Heathens for building such notable structures to their false Gods Insomuch I find very little or no mention at all thereof in the British Stories except by Geffrey Monmouth with some who follow him and by such Authors only as our most judicious Writers hold in many things either meerly fabulous or overladen with malicious or accidentary untruths Such relations neverthelesse as they make thereof I shall endeavour to deliver in their own words reduceable into two conjectures viz either that Stoneheng was erected by A Ambrosius in ancient times King of the Britans in memory of the British Nobility perfidiously slain at a treaty by Hengist the Saxon or else set up by the Britans themselves in honour of Him their said King Sidenote Gir Camb de adm Hib Cap Giraldus Cambrensis curiously diligent in his relations of the miracles in Ireland amongst other strange things in those parts reckons up this Antiquity Stoneheng Fuit antiquis temporibus in Hibernia lapidum congeries admiranda saith he qu Chorea Gigantum dicta fuit quia Gigantes eam ab ultimis Afric partibus in Hiberniam attulerunt c There was in Ireland in ancient times a pile of stones worthy admiration called the Giants Dance because Giants from the remotest parts of Africa brought them into Ireland and in the plains of Kildare not farre from the Castle of the Naase as well by force of Art as strength miraculously set them up These stones according to the British story Aurelius Ambrosius King of the Britans procured Merlin by supernaturall means to bring from Ireland into Britain And that he might leave some famous monument of so great a treason to after ages in the same order and art as they stood formerly set them up where the flower of the British Nation fell by the cut throat practice of the Saxons and where under the pretence of peace the ill secured youth of the Kingdom by murdrous designs were slain Sidenote Polychr li Rainulph Monk of Chester speaking of Aurelius alias Aurelianus Ambrosius by others called Ambrosius Aurelianus saith as Sir John Trevisa the Priest in old English laid it down His brother Uter Pendragon by help of Merlin the Prophet brought Choream Gigantum that is Stonehenges out of Ireland Stonehenge is now in the plain of Salisbury of that bringing of Stonehenge out of Ireland speaketh the British story if it should lawfully be ytrowed It appears Rainulph of Chester as easie credit as he gave to strange stories had not much confidence in this and if according to Geffrey Monmouth or Matthew Westminster I should set it down I presume you would be of his mind But I affect not such conceits they are neither fitting my discourse nor your perusall Neverthelesse seeing none of them tell us by what ways or Arts Giants as they will have it brought them from the remotest parts of Africk into Ireland for it seems they could not hansomly find a Merlin to help them therein also I shall take so much leave following Geffrey Monmouths steps as to give you at least some part of the story and relate according to their opinions how they came from Ireland hither After Geffrey Monmouths discourse of Uter Pendragons victory over the Irish who with Merlin forsooth and a great Army were sent by A Ambrosius to fetch the Giants dance Lapidum structuram adepti saith he gavisi sunt admirati circumstantibus itaque cunctis accessit Merlinus ait utimini viribus vestris juvenes ut in deponendo lapides istos sciatis utrum ingenium virtuti aut virtus ingenio cedat c i e Having found the structure from joy they fell into admiration and standing all of them at gaze round about it Merlin draws near and thus bespeaks them Use now your utmost strength young men that in taking away these stones you may discover whether Art to strength or strength gives place to Art At his command therefore they bring severall sorts of engines and addresse themselves to pulling it down Some ropes some cables some had made lathers ready that what they so much desired might be effected but in no wise able to atcheive their purpose Deficientibus cunctis solutus est Merlinus in risum saith Geffrey suas machinationes confecit Denique cum qu que necessaria apposuisset levi s qu m credi potest lapides deposuit depositis autem fecit deferri ad naves introponi sic cum gaudio in Britanniam reverti c perunt All of them tired Merlin breaks out into laughter and provides his engines Lastly when he had set all things in a readinesse hardly to be beleev d it is with what facility he took them down being taken down he caused them to be carried to the Ships and imbarqued and so with joy they began their return towards Britain Leaving it for us to suppose with as small labour they were imbarqued dis imbarqued and brought from their landing place to Salisbury plain all it seems done by Merlins spels But of this too much Sidenote G Mon li Sidenote Verstegan Ch Neverthelesse as I contemne fables so doe I imbrace and take pleasure in the truth of History and therefore that which concerns the slaughter of the British Nobility by treason of Hengist commander of the Saxons as of greater moment and truth I shall more fully relate And Geffrey Monmouth s Authority in this treacherous slaughter of the Britans though I respect not so much as Ninnius Malmsbury Sigebert and others that affirm the same yet because he was the first after so many and so ancient Authors that father d Stoneheng their monument and A Ambrosius founder thereof and therefore must trace him and his followers therein I will give you the history likewise from him and thus it was Hengist upon his return with new supplies into Britain finding Vortigern beyond expectation restored to the Crown and withall greatly alienated in his affections towards him prepared for his defence with force of arms But whether he thought himself too weak or that he rather sought to be especially revenged on the British Nobility who had wholly unriveted his designs or both he thought it no difficult matter to delude him by a Treaty whom formerly he had so easily beguiled with his Neece Rowena To which purpose he makes an overture to compose the enmities betwixt them at a Parley and the King accepting it appoints Ambresbury Town their meeting place Nec mora statuta die instante convenerunt omnes intra nominatam urbem saith Geffrey de pace habenda colloquium inceperunt Ut igitur horam proditioni su idoneam inspexisset Hengistus vociferatus est Nemet oure saxas ilico Vortigernum accepit per pallium detinuit Audito ocy s signo abstraxerunt i e eduxerunt Saxones cultros suos astantes principes invaserunt ips sque nihil tale pr meditantes jugulaverunt circiter quadringentos sexaginta inter Barones Consules The prefixed day being come they all without delay met in the aforesaid Town and began their Treaty for Peace when therefore Hengist saw fit time for execution of his intended Treason he cried out giving the word Nemet oure saxas Nem eowr seaxes saith Verstegan that is Take your seaxes a kind of crooked knives which each of the Saxons then carried closely in his pocket and forthwith seised upon Vortigern and held him by his robe The Saxons quickly hearing it drew forth their knives and fell upon the Britans standing by of whom part Noblemen part officers of State expecting no such design they slew four hundred and sixty Quorum corpora beatus Eldadus postmodum sepelivit atque Christiano more humavit haud long Kaer caradane qu nunc Salesberia dicitur in c meterio quod est juxta c nobium Ambrii Whose corpses holy Eldad according to custome after Christian manner interred not far from Kaer caradane now called Salisbury in the Churchyard adjoyning to the monastery of Ambresbury Sidenote Ma West fo Sidenote Hollinsh l Speed lib Stow fo Sidenote G Monm lib With this relation of the Saxons treachery Mathew Westminster in his Flores historiarum seems to agree And it wholly destroys the opinion commonly received That the said Treaty with the Saxons the massacre of the Britans and likewise their interment were at Stoneheng and that in memory those matters so transacted there A Ambrosius in the same place erected this Antiquity Wherefore I much wonder our modern historians should cite the aforesaid Authors in confirmation thereof especially when they affirm directly the treaty was held in Ambresbury Town and that the British Nobility fell by Treason there Jussit Vortigernus cives Saxones Maiis Kalendis qu jam instare incipiebant juxta Ambrii c nobium convenire saith G Monmouth Vortigern commanded both his own people and the Saxons upon the Calends of May then approaching to appear near to the Monastery of Ambresbury In Pago Ambri convenire to meet in the Town it self of Ambresbury saith Mathew Westminster In order to which summons that I may proceed with Geffrey Monmouths story explaining himself positively concerning the place statuta die instante convenerunt omnes intra nominatam urbem c the appointed day being come all of them met together within the forenamed Town and there treated The issue whereof was that upon the word given as before related The Saxons drew their knives and falling upon the Britans standing by slew them And lest posterity should doubt those sacrificed for their Countreys cause neglected in their funerals he leaves not there but gives us the direct place and manner of their buriall affirming plainly they were buried by a Metropolitane of those times even in a Church yard as Christians should In c meterio quod est juxta c nobium In the Church yard close by the Monastery saith he There is not one word mentioned I pray observe of Salisbury plain where this Antiquity Stoneheng remains throughout all their Story Sidenote Thomas Procachio fo But it s objected although they were buried at the Monastery the monument for their memory might be set up elsewhere in a place more proper and more conspicuous even as in the most properly conspicuous places where great actions happened Trophies were erected by the Romans whose customs A Ambrosius living long time amongst them knew very well I answer A Ambrosius is suppos d by Bede and the best Authors descended from the Romans who living many years under their subjection in forrain parts had fully inform d his judgement no doubt with whatever customs civill or martiall then in use amongst them For though the Romans in those times had utterly lost all knowledge of Arts questionlesse civill and martiall customs in some sort continued with them Neverthelesse if A Ambrosius did erect any monument for the British Nobility he rather doubtlesse endeavoured to observe the rules of his own Religion being a Christian then the Heathenish customs of his Ancestors However in erecting it at the place of their interment he pursued both As for the Christians honouring to posterity their famous men after death it being so well known I need not relate it And as concerning the ancient Romans manner in burying their Emperours and those that had triumphed or otherwise deserved well of the Common wealth though they burned their bodies abroad the place for sepulture of their Ashes was within the City monuments to their memory being erected upon the same place where buried so was Publicola honoured so the Fabritii the C sars and others And after the same fashion it seems was the monument for the British Nobility if any set up where they were interred as in the place of all others most proper for it all the considerable circumstances touching their deaths happening there in like manner It s true the Romans set up Trophies for great Victories in the most eminent places where those victories were obtained by them as the Trophy for Caius Marius his vanquishing the Cimbrians in the most notable place where that memorable field was fought Also the Trophy dedicated to the memory of Augustus C sar that by his happy conduct all the Alpine Nations were reduced to Roman obedience was erected in the most conspicuous place of the Alps Now this martiall custome considered the British Nobility being as the aforesaid Historians maintain slaughtered in the Town and buried at the Monastery adjoyning Some one of those high hils on either side Ambresbury had certainly for site been more eminent and the monument it self more exposed to the daily view of travellers then about two miles from the Town in a place remote where this Antiquity stands Which though indeed eminent of it self and overlooking the plains adjoyning yet at a large distance especially on that side towards Ambresbury and Salisbury ward is so surrounded with hils as it appears with an Aspect of Religious horror rather then as carrying any form of whatever sepulture Sidenote Math West fo Sidenote G Mon li This though sufficient to refute the preceding objection the former reasons being grounded upon customs only I shall yet from the histories of those times further answer thereunto Mathew Westminster tels us A Ambrosius having compleated his victories over Hengist and subdued his sons at York Deinde porrexisse ad monasterium Ambri ubi principes defuncti jacebant quos Hengistus prodiderat from thence came to the Monastery at Ambresbury where the deceased Nobles whom Hengist betrayed lay buried And Geffrey Monmouth prosecuting the same story affirms also that A Ambrosius being come to the Monastery ut locum quo defuncti jacebant circumspexit pietate motus in lachrymas solutus est dignum namque memoria censebat cespitem qui tot nobiles pro patria defunctos protegebat So soon as he cast his eyes upon the place where the slaughtered Princes lay interred deplored them esteeming that very ground which covered so many Nobles dying for their Countreys cause worthy eternall memory Upon this consideration Pr cepit Merlino saith the same Author lapides circa sepulturam erigere quos ex Hibernia asportaverat A Ambrosius commanded Merlin that the stones brought out of Ireland for he still troubles himself and readers therewith should be erected about the place of their buriall Whereby it clearly appears their Sepulchre was set up about the same place where they were buried and not elsewhere Also as fully that their buriall place as both the said Historians have told us was at the Monastery of Ambresbury or Churchyard adjoyning to it All which former circumstances duly weighed tis not possible Stoneheng should be supposed their Monument except Geffrey Monmouth having made so formall a tale of their easie transportation from Ireland would compell us also to imagine posterity might as easily be induced to assent they were in like manner removed from the Churchyard at Ambresbury to Salisbury plain the one being equally as ridiculous as the other and no manner of credit to be given to either Wherefore laying all the aforesaid Authorities together First that Giraldus Cambrensis formerly cited tells us in that part of his story which carries most likelihood of truth a Monument was set up by A Ambrosius in memory of the Britans slain at a Treaty by the Saxons upon the very same place where slain and in order thereunto the aforesaid British Historians unanimously affirming the place at which that treaty was held and where those Britans were slain was the Town it self of Ambresbury not where this Antiquity Stoneheng remains again if suspect Cambrensis authority and allow rather what our Historiographer of Monmouth saith That the Monument was erected by A Ambrosius upon that plat of ground where the slaughtered Britans lay buryed he telling us also their buriall place was in the Churchyard of the Monastery at Ambresbury at the Monastery it self saith Matthew Westminster certainly then their Monument whatsoever it was being set up at the place where they were both slain and buried and according to the aforesaid Authors they being nor slain nor buryed at Stoneheng it must necessarily follow this Antiquity was not erected in Honour of those Britans Unlesse any man will undertake to prove which most certain it is none can Stoneheng stands now where Ambresbury stood of old or that the Monastery and Churchyard thereof were not at Ambresbury but at Stoneheng Sidenote Cam fo Sidenote G Monm lib That the Monastery of three hundred Monks stood there to wit at Ambresbury Camden out of the Book called Eulogium affirms And that the Churchyard was close adjoyning to it there s no question to be made First because in all times since Monasteries erected it was always in use to lay out places for Churchyards belonging to them near to the Monasteries themselves Secondly because divers Sepulchres upon severall occasions broken up at Ambresbury Monastery manifest the same Thirdly because Geffrey Monmouth plainly tels us they were buried in c meterio quod est juxta c nobium in the Churchyard which is close by the Monastery Lastly it is further confirmed by these his formerly recited words A Ambrosius being come unto the Monastery cast his eyes upon the place where the slaughtered Princes lay interred Which is not possible he should have done if the Churchyard had been at Stoneheng it being very well known Stoneheng cannot be discerned even from the highest hils upon those parts especially that next surround Ambresbury much lesse from the Monastery it self sited in the bottome of a deep vale by the river Avons side Among other Sepulchres found at the said Monastery it s worthy memory that about the beginning of this Century one of them hewn out of a firm stone and placed in the middle of a wall was opened having upon its coverture in rude letters of massie gold Sidenote The originall Inscription I could not procure such relation thereof neverthelesse as came to my hands I have upon credit of those persons of quality from whom received inserted it here R G A C Sidenote Leyl de assert Arth The bones within which Sepulchre were all firm fair yellow coloured hair about the scull a supposed peece of the liver near upon the bignesse of a walnut very dry and hard and together therewith were found severall royall habiliments as jewels veils scarfs and the like retaining even till then their proper colours All which were afterwards very choicely kept in the collection of the Right honourable Edward then Earl of Hertford and of the aforesaid gold divers rings were made and worn by his Lordships principall Officers Concerning which Tomb though I list not dispute why might it not be the Sepulchre of Queen Guinever wife of King Arthur especially the Letters R G as much to say Regina Guinevera declaring her title and name and the date An Chr if truly copied agreeing possibly well enough with the time of her death Besides Leyland affirms severall Writers make mention she took upon her a Nuns veil at Ambresbury died and was buried there To which he gives so much credit that whatever Giraldus Cambrensis delivers to the contrary he will by no means allow either her body to be afterwards translated from Ambresbury or at any time buried by her husband King Arthur at Glastonbury Unto Leylands reasons for her interment at Ambresbury Camden it seems inclines also because wholly silent of her Sepulchre discovered any where else though he at large sets down all the circumstances of her Husbands body its being found at Glastenbury For had Camden apprehended any thing inducing him to beleeve her body had been together with his there found he would never certainly have concealed it from posterity Sidenote Speed lib Sidenote Stow fo Whether the aforesaid Tomb so found were her monument yea or no enough concerning the slaughter and sepultures of the afore mentioned Britans as also that Stoneheng was not erected in memory of them Let us come now to Aurelius Ambrosius and see whether Polydore Virgill s story in relation to Stoneheng agrees with what other Authors have delivered of Aurelius For from Polydore s authority our modern Writers raise their second and quite contrary opinion namely that the Britans erected this Antiquity for A Ambrosius his Sepulchre Sidenote Polyd Virg lib Polydore Virgill treating of the actions of those times betwixt the Britans and Saxons Britanni Duci suo Ambrosio de republica bene merito magnificum saith he posuerunt sepulchrum c The Britans in memory of his great atchievements for the Commonwealth erected a magnificent Sepulchre to their Chieftain Ambrosius made of great square stones in form of a Crown even in that place where fighting he was slain that the prowesse of so great a Commander should neither be forgotten amongst themselves who then lived or left unremembred to posterity Which Monument remains even to this day in the Diocese of Salisbury near unto the village called Amisbery This opinion of Polydore is grounded as I conceive upon no great likelihood For should the British Nobles far inferiour to A Ambrosius in honour and dignity be buried in the Churchyard of a Monastery and a Sepulchre assigned for Ambrosius himself in the open fields Should that Christian King who had accomplished so many great atchievements victoriously against the Pagans enemies to Christ Caused Churches to be repaired which the Barbarism of the Saxons had destroyed pulled down and demolished idolatrous places of the Heathen and as is more probable rather then erected by him whilst living to others or by others to his memory after dead the very first that began to deface this Heathenish sacred structure for though a Roman yet a Christian and zeal to true Religion might no doubt cause him dispense with ruining idolatrous Temples though formerly built and consecrated to false Gods by his seduced Auncestors should he I say be buried Pagan like in unsanctified unhallowed ground and others far lesse eminent lesse conspicuous in more noble and sacred places It could never be Neither reason of State nor fervor of piety in those more scrupulous times could ever admit thereof Sidenote Leyl de assert Art Had Polydore or any other told us some Pagan Saxon Commander lay there intombed twould have carried a shew of much more credit and the ancient custome of that Peoples burying their dead might have been produced at least as a probable argument to confirm the same For the Saxons a Pagan Nation if any of their Princes or Nobility died in their houses at home of sicknesse were buried in pleasant and delightfull gardens if from home and in the wars not far from their camps in heaps of earth cast up in the fields which heaps they called Burrows and the promiscuous common people in medows and open fields Saxones Nobiles gens Christi ignara in hortis am nis si domi forte groti moriebantur si foris bello occisi in egestis per campos terr tumulis quos Burgos appellabant juxta castra sepulti

Leyland Sidenote Knolls in vit Ba Sidenote Ped Mexia in vit Con Sidenote Plutarch in vit Pyrr Polydore neverthelesse had great reason to imagine A Ambrosius famed the restorer of his Countrey and Bulwark of War as Camden cals him worthy an everlasting Monument Extat etiam nunc id monimentum in di cesi Sarisberiensi prope pagum quam Amisberiam vocant Which monument is yet extant in the di cese of Salisbury saith he not far from Ambresbury Town and so was the Churchyard of the Monastery too He also tels us Factum fuisse ad formam coron it was made in form of a Crown An elegant expression I confesse of a no lesse elegant work if he meant Stoneheng yet no argument thereby to prove A Ambrosius or buried or slain there For as touching A Ambrosius his death severall Authors of as good credit as Polydore his integrity neverthelesse I question not others have been busie enough therein affirm that Pascentius Vortigerns son with many rewards corrupted a certain Saxon called Eopas Clappa saith Caxton who taking upon him the habit of a Monk under pretence of Physick A Ambrosius being then sick gave him poyson whereof he died at Winchester And no wonder he was so poysoned many examples of the like kinde being recorded in History As in later times the Turkish Emperour Bajazet the second under pretence of Physick poysoned by a Jew also Conrad third of that name Emperour of Germany by an Italian and in times of old under the same pretence Pyrrhus that famous Epirot had been poysoned by his own Physitian if C Fabricius the Roman Consul would have enclined to such ignoble resolutions as Pascentius after put in act against A Ambrosius in our story Sidenote Ma West fo Amongst other who relate this disaster of A Ambrosius Matthew Westminster tels us The said pretended Monk tandem ad Regis pr sentiam perductum venenum ei porrexisse c being at last admitted to the Kings presence administered poyson unto him which having drunk the wicked Traytor advised him to sleep and in so doing suddenly should recover health Nec mora illabente per poros corporis venas veneno mortem pariter subsecutam esse But ere long the poyson being dispersed through the pores and veins of his body death seizes upon him Sidenote G Monm lib Concerning the buriall of A Ambrosius if give credit to Geffrey Monmouths affirming A Ambrosius on his death bed gave command and was accordingly buried in the Sepulchre by him whilst living prepared in the Churchyard adjoyning to the Monastery at Ambresbury then was A Ambrosius nor buried at Stoneheng nor consequently this Antiquity erected to his memory Geffrey Monmouth tels us His death being known the Bishops Abbats and all the Clergy of that province assembled together in the City of Winchester Et quia vivens adhuc pr ceperat ut in c meterio prope c nobium Ambrii quod ipse paraverat sepeliretur tulerunt corpus ejus eodem atque cum regalibus exequiis humaverunt And with respect to his command whilest living that in the Churchyard adjoyning to the Monastery at Ambresbury prepared by him he would be buried they took his body and with royall solemnities enterred him there Sidenote Cam fo Furthermore at Ambresbury that is Ambrose his Town Camden tels us certain ancient Kings by report of the British story lay interred Whether A Ambrosius was one of them or no I argue not yet the same Author saith Ambrose Aurelianus gave name unto the place And why not he being buried there as well as upon the translation of the body of Edmund that most Christian King the Town of Edmundsbury in Suffolk was so called It manifestly hence appears Stoneheng no Sepulchre either erected by A Ambrosius or by the British Nobility or to any of their memories Some Monument there was perhaps anciently set up in honour of them at the Monastery of Ambresbury Which the fury of the Saxons when victorious or violence of time which destroyeth all things utterly consuming might happily be the reason Historians in succeeding Ages finding so notable an Antiquity as Stoneheng not far from thence and not apprehending for what use it was first built suppos d no other thing worthy A Ambrosius or those Britans then such an extraordinary structure Whereas the Monuments in those ancient times made for great Princes here in Britain were onely two Pyramids between which interred of no extraordinary bignesse erected to their memory in whate re Religious places those Princes lay buried Moreover if seriously take notice of the severall sorts of Sepulchres used by divers Nations none are found bearing like Aspect with this work Stoneheng but of other kinde of Architecture far different in Form Manner and Composure Some made of one Columne onely or if otherwise only a vase erected on the place of buriall as amongst the Athenians Some had a Columne whereon the shields used in War by the deceased whilst living were fixt as in those medals of silver which the Roman Senate dedicated to Vespasian Some a Columne with a Statue thereon so the famous Columne of Trajan had a Colossus on the top thereof as by his medals also appears Again the Gauls on the tops of Mountains erected Pyramid s or Columnes as Monuments to their Princes The Saxons were buried as said before in huge heaps of earth to this day visible among us The Keep of the now Castell S Angelo at Rome was the Sepulchre of the Emperour Adrian such mighty moles were the Monuments of the Romans The Greeks erected Altars and instituted Sacrifices to the memory of their Chieftains as the Spartans to Lysander The renowned Carian Queen made the Mausoleum for her husband a massie bulk of building foot high The huge Pyramid s in gypt causing such wonder in the world were Sepulchres of gyptian Kings In a word amongst all Nations Sepulchres whether little or great were always reall and solid piles not airous with frequent openings and void spaces of ground within exposed to Sun and wind neither uncovered like this Antiquity or in any manner so built as may enforce the least presumption that this our Stoneheng was ever a Sepulchre Sidenote Leyland de assert Art fol I have given you a full relation what concerning Stoneheng hath been delivered by Writers in respect of us though ancient yet in regard of the great antiquity of this Work indeed but modern Geffrey Monmouth living not full five hundred years ago and Polydore Virgill long after him in King Henry the eighths reign Who as they are the principall Authors that write any thing of Stoneheng so upon what authority deliver the same they make not appear Insomuch Camden gives no more credit to their relations in this very particular then unto common sayings so he cals them as if grounded upon Fame only or invented by themselves And it may the rather be so presumed because as they lived not in ancient times and consequently could not themselves bear testimony of any such things so neither the Britans nor Saxons for a long time after their first arrivall here had any Records or Writings to convey whatever actions either of their own or others to posterity Ninnius a British Historian living about one thousand years ago telling us Britannos doctores nullam peritiam habuisse c The great Masters and Doctors of Britain had no skill nor left memoriall of any thing in writing confessing that himself gathered whatsoever he wrote out of the Annals and Chronicles of the holy Fathers Nec Saxones amusi quicquam pen de rebus inter ipsos Britannos eo tempore gestis scriptum posteritati reliquerint c Neither did the Saxons being unlearned saith Leyland leave almost any thing in writing to posterity of the actions performed in those times betwixt themselves and Britans whatsoever remembred after Christ taught in this Island of the first victories of the Saxons being both taken up upon trust from the mouth of the common people and committed to writing from vulgar reports only Neither the Britans utterly worn out with so many wars had as the same Author hath it or desire or opportunity had they desired it to bestow their pains in compiling any whatever history that might commend their actions to succeeding Ages But it maybe objected If Polydore Virgill and Geffrey Monmouth could neither be eye witnesses themselves nor have authority from other more ancient Authors for what related by them concerning Stoneheng and that from whatever writings ancient or modern not any thing of certainty can be found out concerning the same from whence then appear for what use or by whom Stoneheng erected I answer though not appear from Histories written either by the Britans or Saxons yet as Gildas professing he wrote his History for the former reasons by relations from beyond Sea and as Ninnius his out of the Annals and Chronicles of the holy Fathers as aforesaid so severall other ways a possibility of truth may be gathered namely from the authority of other Nations from the concurrence of time for such undertakings from the customs of forepassed Ages in like works from the manner and form of building proper to severall Countries from the use to which such buildings applied and the like Upon which as occasion serves intending hereafter more largely to insist I shall in the mean while set down the judgement our late Writers give of this Antiquity Sidenote Cam fo Camden a diligent searcher after Antiquities of our Nation having in his Chorography of Wiltshire collected all the aforesaid opinions together with his own gives a summary description of Stoneheng in words as follow Towards the North about six miles from Salisbury in the plain is to be seen a huge and monstrous peece of work such as Cicero termeth insanam substructionem For within the circuit of a ditch there are erected in manner of a Crown in three ranks or courses one within another certain mighty and unwrought stones whereof some are twenty eight foot high seven foot broad upon the heads of which others like overthwart peeces do bear and rest cross wise with a small tenon and mortaise so as the whole frame seemeth to hang whereof we call it Stoneheng like as our old Historians termed it for the greatness the Giants dance Our Countrimen reckon this for one of our wonders and miracles And much they marvell from whence such huge stones were brought considering that in all those quarters bordering thereupon there is hardly to be found any common stone at all for building as also by what means they were set up For mine own part about these points I am not curiously to argue and dispute but rather to lament with much grief that the Authors of so notable a Monument are thus buried in oblivion Yet some there are that think them to be no naturall stones hewn out of the rock but artificially made of pure sand and by some glewy and unctuous matter knit and incorporate together like as those ancient trophies or monuments of victory which I have seen in Yorkshire And what marvell Read we not I pray you in Pliny that the sand or dust of Puteoli being covered over with water becometh forthwith a very stone that the cisterns in Rome of sand digged out of the ground and the strongest kind of lime wrought together grow so hard that they seem stones indeed and that statues and images of marble scalings and small grit grow together so compact and firm that they were deemed entire and solid marble The common saying is that Ambrosius Aurelianus or his brother Uther did rear them up by the art of Merlin c Thus far Camden it being needlesse to repeat more from him having already delivered the story from the Authors themselves Yet here neverthelesse as necessarily induced thereunto I shall take leave to observe something more remarkable to our purpose in hand upon his words In the first place then Stoneheng is by him called a huge and monstrous peece of work terming it from Cicero insanam substructionem To which I say had Camden as well attained other abilities of an Architect as he was skilfull in Antiquities or been as conversant in Antiquities abroad as learned in those of his own Nation he would have given a far different judgement hereof For whosoever is acquainted with the ancient ruines yet remaining in and about Italy may easily perceive this no such huge building either for the circuit of the work or bignesse of the stones they being as manageable to the Roman Architects as amongst us to raise a May pole or mast of a Ship And if this styled huge and monstrous what may be said of Diocletians baths the great Cirque Marcellus his Theater Vespasians Temple of Peace and other prodigious works of the Romans the very remainders whereof now lying in the dust breed amazement and wonder not without just reason too in whosoever beholds them with attentivenesse and judgement Nay whereas he styles it insanam substructionem it s demonstrable that betwixt this Island of great Britain and Rome it self there s no one structure to be seen wherein more clearly shines those harmoniacall proportions of which only the best times could vaunt then in this of Stoneheng Moreover Our Countreymen marvell saith he from whence such huge stones were brought considering that in all those quarters bordering thereupon there is hardly to be found any common stone for building Upon what trust Camden his extraordinary judgement otherwise considered took this relation I know not For there is not onely common stone thereabouts for ordinary uses but stone of extraordinary proportions likewise even for greater works if occasion were then Stoneheng the Quarries of Hasselborough and Chilmark both of them not far from the borders of the plain having of a long time furnished all the adjacent parts with common stone for building And to come nearer the matter it is manifest that in divers places about the Plain the same kinde of Stone whereof this Antiquity consists may be found especially about Aibury in North Wiltshire not many miles distant from it where not onely are Quarries of the like stone but also stones of far greater dimensions then any at Stoneheng may be had Sidenote Plut in Marcel Sidenote Herod lib Sidenote Ptol lib Sidenote Plin lib Sidenote Dom Font lib They wonder also saith he by what means they that is such huge stones were set up What may be effected by that Mechanicall Art which Dee in his Mathematicall Preface to Euclyde cals Menadry or Art of ordering Engines for raising weights those it seems of whom Camden speaks took little notice of when Archimedes during the siege of Syracuse raised out of the Sea and turned in the air at pleasure the Ships and Gallies of the Romans full fraught as they were with Souldiers Mariners and their ordinary lading and if King Hieron could have assigned him a fit place to firm his engines on he would have undertaken to remove even the terrestriall Globe out of the worlds center so high perfection in this Art transported him What should I say of the Obelisk in Ages so far past brought from the Mountains of Armenia and erected in Babylon by Semiramis one hundred fifty foot high and at the base twenty four foot square of one entire stone Est in fano Laton saith Herodotus of his own knowledge delubrum ex uno factum lapide cujus parietes quali celsitudine ad longitudinem quadragenum cubitorum cujus lacunari pro tecto impositus est alius lapis quatuor cubitorum per oras crassitudine In the Temple of Latona in gypt is a Chappell formed of one stone whose walls being of equall height are in length forty cubits covered in like manner with one sole stone four cubits thick Those which made this wonder would have much more admired if they could have seen the Obelisk raised in times of old by King Ramesis at Heliopolis in that part of gypt anciently called Thebais in height one hundred twenty one Geometrical feet which of our measure makes one hundred thirty six feet of one entire stone and so little wonder made they of raising it that the Architect undertook and did effect it the Kings own son being at the same time bound to the top thereof Amongst the Romans Augustus C sar erected in the great Cirque at Rome an Obelisk of one stone one hundred and twenty foot nine inches long another also was set up in Mars field nine foot higher then it by the said Emperour And it seems also neither they nor Camdens self had ever seen that Obelisk which even in these our days in the year one thousand five hundred eighty six Sixtus Quintus caused to be erected in the Piazza of S Peter at Rome one hundred and eight Roman palms high and at the base twelve palms square according to our Assise fourscore and one foot high and nine foot square of one entire stone also Dominico Fontana being Architect But there are more strange things as Sir Walter Raleigh hath it in the world then betwixt London and Stanes It is want of knowledge in Arts makes such admirers and Art it self have so many Enemies Had I not been thought worthy by him who then commanded to have been sole Architect thereof I would have made some mention of the great stones used in the work and Portico at the West end of S Pauls Church London but I forbear though in greatnesse they were equall to most in this Antiquity and raised to a far greater height then any there What manner of Engines the Ancients used for raising and what secure ways they had for cariage and transportation of their huge weights is more proper for another subject Sidenote Vitr lib cap Some there are saith Camden that think them to be no naturall stones hewn out of the rock but artificially made of pure sand and by some glewy and unctuous matter knit and incorporate together like those ancient trophies or monuments of victory which I have seen in Yorkshire As for these Monuments for my part I have not seen otherwise I would give my sense upon them and happily they may be found as far from being artificiall as those at Stoneheng And what marvell saith he read we not I pray you in Pliny that the sand or dust of Puteoli being covered over with water becometh forthwith a very stone c He might as well have told us the Rocks in Portland are artificiall But it s true this sand of Puteoli was much used by the Ancients and it is such a kind of earth as is very famous for its admirable effects in building being tempered with the cement of Cuma For it not onely yeelds strength to all other buildings but thereby also all works made in the Sea under water are most firmly consolidated Yet doe I not find that ever the Ancients made any artificiall stones thereof or that Vitruvius hath any thing to that purpose to him the credit given to Pliny and others concerning the Earth of Puteoli being only due posterity being in the first place beholding unto him for finding out the nature of that earth he giving us not only the effects thereof but the cause also from whence those effects proceed Hoc autem fieri hac ratione videtur qu d sub his montibus i e in regionibus Baianis in agris qu sunt circa Vesuvium montem terr ferventes sunt fontes crebri qui non essent si non in imo haberent aut de sulphure aut alumine aut bitumine ardentes maximos ignes Which is saith he by reason in those mountains to wit in the regions of Bai and fields about mount Vesuvius the grounds are hot and full of springs which heat could not be but that from the bottome are nourished mighty great fires arising from sulphur alume or brimstone there Indeed according to Pliny the sand upon the side of the hill of Puteoli being opposed to the Sea and continually drenched and drowned with the water thereof doth by the restringent quality no doubt of the salt water become a stone so compact and united together that scorning all the violence of the surging billows it hardeneth every day more and more Neverthelesse whosoever could find out any kind of earth in this Island naturally apt to make artificiall stones of such greatnesse as these and like them so obdurate also that hardly any tool enter them or that our Auncestors in times of old did make use of such a cement and in what manner composed by them The benefit thereof doubtlesse would amount so ample to this Nation that Records could not but render him deservedly famous to all posterity In the mean while as it is most certain those stones at Stoneheng are naturall so am I as clearly of opinion the very Quarries from whence hewn were about Aibury beforementioned where no small quantities of the same kind are even at this day to be had vast scantlings not only appearing about the Town it self but throughout the plain and fields adjoyning the Quarries lying bare numbers also numberlesse of stones are generally seen being no small prejudice to the bordering inhabitants As also not far from the edge of Wiltshire in the ascent from Lamborn to Whitehorse hill the like stones are daily discovered To mention more places in particular is needlesse the Quarries at and about Aibury without relating to Lamborn or what ever other distant but fifteen miles or thereabouts from Stoneheng being of themselves sufficient to clear the doubt These having through long time got the very same crustation upon them are in like manner coloured grained bedded weighty and of like difficulty in working as those at Stoneheng Some of which being of a whitish colour are intermixt and veined here and there with red some of a lightish blew glister as if minerall amongst them some for the most part white perplexed as it were with a ruddy colour some dark gray and russet differing in kinds as those stones at Aibury do Some of them again of a grayish colour are speckled or intermixt with dark green and white together with yellow amongst it resembling after a sort that kind of marble which the Italians from the valley where the Quarries are found call Pozzevera nothing notwithstanding so beautifull though naturally much harder and being weathered by time as in this work disdain the touch even of the best tempered tool Insomuch that if nothing else the more then ordinary hardnesse of them is such as will in part convince any indifferent judgement in the nature and quality of stones those in this Antiquity are not as Camden would have them artificiall but naturall Sidenote H Hunting lib Sidenote Cam fo Whatsoever worthy admiration concerning Stoneheng either in relation to the greatnesse of the work in generall the extraordinary proportion of the stones in particular the wonder the people make from whence brought by what Arts or Engines raised and in such order placed Camden delivers certainly in his judgement he was wholly opposite to the opinions of the aforesaid British Historians He would never else with so much regret have complained The Authors of so notable a Monument lay buried in oblivion had he given any the least credit this Antiquity had been built either by A Ambrosius or the British Nobility or to eternize either of their names or actions to succeeding generations Let Geffrey Monmouth and his followers say what they please Henry Huntingdon his Contemporary if not more Ancient is mine Author Nec potest aliquis excogitare qua arte tanti lapides adeo in altum elevati sunt vel quare ibi constructi sunt No man knows saith Huntingdon for what cause Stoneheng erected or which is fully answered already by what Art such huge stones were raised to so great a height Take with you also Draytons judgement in his Poly olbion couched under the fiction of old Wansdikes depraving Stoneheng Wansdike being a huge Ditch in Wiltshire so called anciently as Camden opines dividing the two Kingdomes of the Mertians and West Saxons asunder Sidenote Poly olbion Cant Whom for a paltry ditch when Stonendge pleas d t upbraid The old man taking heart thus to that Trophy said Dull heap that thus thy head above the rest doth reare Precisely yet not know st who first did place thee there But Traytor basely turn d to Merlins skill dost flie And with his Magicks dost thy Makers truth belie For as for that ridiculous Fable of Merlins transporting the stones out of Ireland by Magick it s an idle conceit As also that old wives tale that for the greatnesse it was in elder times called the Giants dance The name of the dance of Giants by which it is styled in Monmouth hath nothing allusive no not so much as to the tale he tels us saith a modern Writer in the life of Nero C sar Sidenote Speed lib Stow fo in Sidenote Cam fo Speed lib Furthermore our modern Historians Stow and Speed tell us in severall parts of the Plain adjoyning have been by digging found peeces of ancient fashioned armour and the bones of men insinuating this as an argument for upholding the opinions of the British Writers To which if they would have those to be the bones of the slaughtered Britans how came those Armours to be found with them they coming to the Treaty unarmed and without weapons Howsoever what is done in the Plains abroad concerns not Stoneheng Neither can any man think it strange that in a place where Fame hath rendred so many memorable and fierce battels fought in times of old rusty armour and mens bones should be digged up It is usuall throughout the world in all such places and if I mistake not Sands in his Travels relates that even in the Plains of Pharsalia such like bones and Armour have lately been discovered and Sir Henry Blunt in that notable relation of his voyage into the Levant speaks with much judgement of those Pharsalian fields Likewise the aforesaid Writers might well have remembred some of themselves deliver that at Kambulan or Cambula in Cornwall such habiliments of War have been digged up in tillage of the ground witnessing either the fatall field sometimes there fought where Mordred was slain by Arthur and Arthur himself received his deaths wound or else the reliques of that battel betwixt the Britans and Saxons in the year eight hundred and twenty Tis true the relation conduces much towards confirming that ancient custome of the Saxons formerly recited out of Leyland considering especially not far from this Antiquity lie certain hillocks at this day commonly called the seven Burrows where it may be presumed some Princes or Nobles of the Saxon Nation lie interred But that Stoneheng should therefore be a place of buriall the aforesaid relation to maintain the same is nothing worth They adde moreover the stones yet remaining are not to be numbred according as our Noble Sydney in his Sonnet of the wonders of England Near Wilton sweet huge heaps of stone are found But so confus d that neither any eye Can count them just nor reason reason try What force brought them to so unlikely ground This though it scarcely merits an answer yet to satisfie those which in this point may be curious let them but observe the orders of the Circles as they now appear and not passe from one to another confusedly noting neverthelesse where they begin and they ll find the just number easie to be taken Now though whether in order to the Place it self where this Antiquity stands or Persons by whom Stoneheng pretended to be built enough laid to wave the reports upon fancy or common Fame formerly delivered to the state of Time neverthelesse wherein the British Histories would have it erected because nothing by me hath yet been spoken I will therefore adde tis not probable such a work as Stoneheng could be then built For although our Britans in ancient time possessed together with the Roman civility all good Arts it is evident during the reign of A Ambrosius about the first coming in of the Saxons here and towards the later end of the fifth Century as Historians and Chronologists compute it in the last declining of the Roman Empire the Arts of Design of which Architecture chief were utterly lost even in Rome it self much more in Britain being then but a Tempest beaten Province and utterly abandoned by the Romans Britain therefore being over run with enemies and the knowledge of Arts then lost amongst them none questionlesse can reasonably apprehend so notable a work as Stoneheng could in such times be built Sidenote Serl lib That amongst the Romans and Britans both A Ambrosius governing here all Sciences were utterly perished is evidently manifest For the Goths had then invaded Italy and that vast Empire drooping with extreme Age by the fatall irruption of strange Nations was not only torn in peeces but Barbarisme having trod learning under foot and the sword bearing more sway then letters or learned men all Sciences were neglected and particularly that of Building fell into such decay that till of late about the year one thousand five hundred and ten it lay swallowed up and as I may so say buried in oblivion When one Bramante of the Dutchy of Urbin attaining admirable perfection in Architecture restored to the world again the true rules of building according to those Orders by the ancient Romans in their most flourishing times observed Furthermore not onely liberall Sciences and Architecture but Art military also about the time of A Ambrosius was so far lost amongst the Romans that they were ignorant yea in the very rudiments of War Insomuch as Procopius in his second Book of the Gothick Wars relate Barbarism had bereft them of the skill even in what manner to sound a retreat Sidenote W Malmes fol Camden fo With us here also the Saxons domineer d over all and A Ambrosius with the Britans had enough to do in endeavouring the recovery of their lost Countrey from a mighty prevailing Enemy that in few years afterwards maugre all the ways which force or policy could invent conquered the whole Nation Among other calamities attending that miserable Age Camden from William of Malmsbury directly to the purpose in hand tels us Cum Tyranni nullum in agris pr ter semibarbaros nullum in urbibus pr ter ventri deditos reliquissent Britannia omni patrocinio juvenilis vigoris viduata omni Artium exercitio exinanita conterminarum gentium inhiationi diu obnoxia fuit When the Tyrants to wit the Romans had left none in the Countrey but half Barbarians none in the Cities and Towns but such as wholly gave themselves to belly cheer Britain destitute of all protection by her vigorous young men bereaved of all exercise and practice of good Arts became exposed for a long time to the greedy and gaping jaws of Nations confining upon her Sidenote Gildas Here you have it from an Author more ancient then G Monmouth a little though both lived in one age the times about A Ambrosius government whether before during his reign or after were so full of miseries that he complains none then employed or exercised in any whatever works belonging to Art They had somthing else as appears by divers Writers to think upon all their abilities being insufficient to defend their Countrey from forein servitude their Cities and Towns from ruine and destruction and their habitations from rage of cruell and insolent enemies robbing spoiling burning wasting all before them to which plague pestilence and famine being joyned the inland part of the Island even to the Western Ocean was welnear totally consumed Besides the Countrey was so oppress d what with outward hostile miseries what with intestine tumults and troubles that had they not lost the practice of all Arts as the former Historian saith they had so far were they from erecting any work of this kind that they were compelled to abandon their Towns and houses built in times foregoing by their Auncestors and betake themselves to mountains caves and woods for shelter Now if the calamities of those times hung over the Britans heads in so generall manner that not one amongst them had leisure to put pen to paper as from Leyland before remembred much lesse able were they without all peradventure to undertake so great a work as Stoneheng wherein as all rationall men must grant numbers of men employed and many years taken up before brought to its absolute perfection Sidenote Cam fo But nothing can better expresse the ignorance of that Age then the barbarous manner of inscription upon the Tomb of the British Hector King Arthur nephew to A Ambrosius found long since in the Churchyard of the Abbey at Glastenbury the letters whereof being exactly represented to our view by Camden do as by demonstration fully discover to us the Barbarism of those times As barbarous in those characters so were they ignorant in and had lost the use of all other Arts Nor exercise nor practice of good Arts was then amongst them saith the Historiographer of Malmsbury And well he might so deliver himself not withstanding Matthew Westminster tels us A Ambrosius repaired Churches which the rage of Saxons enemies to Christian Religion spoiled For besides the vast difference betwixt such works as Stoneheng where Art overmasters the common skill of man and making up the decaies of ruinated buildings is apprehensive even to the meanest capacities Gildas and Bede whose Antiquity and learning the greater it is the more is their authority acceptable affirm the Britans in those times knew not in what manner to bring up bare wals of stone When the Roman Legion sent to aid the Britans by Valentinian the third under the conduct of Gallio of Ravenna was remanded hence for defence of France before departing they exhorted the Britans to make a wall overthwart the Island to secure themselves from the Barbarians Picts and Scots which wall Bede tels us was made not so much with stone as turffes considering they had no workmen to bring up such works of stone and so saith the venerable Historian they did set up one good for nothing Twas made by the rude and unskilfull common multitude not so much of stone as turffes saith Gildas also none being found able to give direction for building works of stone This was about thirty six years preceding A Ambrosius government In which time the Romans abandoning Britain Vortigern usurped call d in the Saxons to his aid was deposed by his Nobility and Vortimer his son set up Whom Rowena having made away Vortigern was re enthronis d Him A Ambrosius invades and having burnt him together with Rowena in Wales assumes the Crown as his holding continuall war with the Saxons untill poysoned by Pascentius as aforesaid It being thus that nothing but universall confusion and destructive broyls of war appeared then in all parts more ancient and far more propitious times must be sought out for designing a structure so exquisite in the composure as this even such a flourishing Age as when Architecture in rare perfection and such People lookt upon as by continuall successe attaining unto the sole power over Arts as well as Empires commanded all I say such Times and Persons because those things which accord not with the course of time which by a generall consent of Authors agree not which by the approved customes of ancient Ages and votes of learned men are not received and allowed and consequently no ways probable I easily admit not of Another fiction there is concerning Stoneheng not to be past over and though the cause upon which it s grounded be far more ancient then the government of Ambrosius or aforesaid slaughter of the Britains neverthelesse in respect it is a new conceit not thirty years being past since hatch t I suppose this the most proper place to discourse thereof having ended with Geffrey Monmouth Polydore Virgill and their followers Sidenote Ner C s fo The Author thereof is Anonymus unlesse known in being Translator of Lucius Florus His opinion in his Nero C sar Stoneheng the Tomb of Boadicia formerly remembred Queen of the Iceni His reasons first because that memorable battell betwixt her and Suetonius Paulinus fought upon a Plain Secondly in respect the Britans buried her magnificently For confirming this he tels us Had the pretieus volumes of the Cornelian Annals and Dio Cassius and John Xiphiline been within the spheare of Geffrey Monmouths studies not Aurelus Ambrosius nor those four hundred and sixty Noblemen of Britain murthered in Vortigerns reign should have carried away with him the fame of this materiall wonder but magnanimous Boadicia It seems he would not be behinde hand with Monmouth for as the one finding no story more famous then of A Ambrosius and the slaughtered Britans fathered Stoneheng upon them so to make the inventive faculty as apparently predominant in himself this other respecting Boadicia s heroicall actions would as willingly make the world beleeve this Antiquity her Monument His principall argument I delivered before to wit the battell betwixt Her and the Romans wherein Boadicia utterly overthrown too being fought upon a Plain Was there in old time did he think no Plain in Britain to fight a battell on but Salisbury Plain How came Boadicia and her Army thither I find indeed Boadicia leading one hundred and twenty thousand fighting men out of the Icenian Countries and like a terrible tempest falling upon Camalodunum that famous Roman Colony of old where the first fury of the War was felt she surprised it and razed it to the ground Suetonius Paulinus then in Anglesey Intercepting Petilius Cerealis who advanced with the ninth legion to relieve that Colony she cut all his Infantry in peeces Putting to the sword all those which imbecillity of sex tediousnesse of age or pleasure of the place detained from following Suetonius in his march from London And taking Verulamium sackt and burnt it down to ashes But how she marcht from thence to Salisbury Plain is neither apparent nor probable not the least inkling being left in the world what hostile acts she committed which way she moved or what done by her after the ruine of Verulam till utterly overthrown Sidenote Tacit Ann lib Sidenote Dion Cas lib Can it be imagined she that destroyed so great a Colony together with a free borough of the Romans slain seventy or eighty thousand persons in such horrid manner as scarce credible reserving not one Prisoner alive but killing hanging crucifying and burning whatsoever Romane or to that party enclined that was yet victorious and her Army encreasing daily can it be imagined I say she marcht to Salisbury Plain with so huge an Army invisibly or stole from Verulam thither by night lest notice should be taken of her proceedings Anonymus self cannot think so unworthily of his Boadicia yet certainly after such manner she went if ever went thither at all Otherwise Boadicia marching in the height of glory and bearing down all before her till rancountred by Suetonius Those faithfull Historians Tacitus and Dion both so sedulous in delivering her Fame to posterity would never have omitted so notable a march through such a large tract of enemies Countrey as of necessity she was to make from Verulam to Salisbury Plain but would have prosecuted her War by recording the spoyls rapines burnings and devastations made therein as particularly as from the first fomenting the rebellion till her advance to Verulam they have done Upon which Town and the aforementioned places only the aforesaid Historians directly tell us the whole burden of the War fell Ad Septuaginta millia civium sociorum iis qu memoravi locis occidisse constitit saith Tacitus It was manifest there were slain in the places I have remembred the number of seventy thousand Citizens and Allies Bunduica duas urbes saith Xiphilines Dion also populi Romani expugnavit atque diripuit in i sque c dem infinitam ut supradixi fecit Bunduica took and razed to the ground two Towns of the Romans and in them made that infinite slaughter I have mentioned before of fourscore thousand persons At Verulam then it fully appears the course of her Victories stopt the inhumane butchery of the Romans and their confederates ended with the massacre in that Town which could not possibly have hapned if with such a firm resolution to extirpate the Roman name in Britain and such a numerous Army to effect it she had gone on victoriously unfought with so far as where this Antiquity stands And therefore the Plain of Salisbury could not be the place of battell as Anonymus would fain enforce it Who having so largely and with so good advice discoursed the motions and actions of this rebellion with all the circumstances thereof from the first rise till she destroyed Verulam should either have found some warrantable authority for Boadicia s so great an undertaking afterwards else never engaged her so far within the Roman Province otherwise some may imagine he framed it only out of ambition for a meer pretence rather then stated it from a reall endeavour to make discovery for what cause Stoneheng at first erected Sidenote Tacit Ann lib Sidenote Dion Cass lib Furthermore Suetonius Paulinus was too well skilled in the discipline of war to make the seat thereof in a Countrey so absolutely Roman as betwixt the British Ocean and the River Thames He had it s true being return d from Anglesey abandoned London no colony But upon what result finding his accesse of strength disproportionable to the War in hand and therefore determined with the losse of one Town to preserve the rest whole whether London or Camalodunum is not to the purpose and by attending the motions of the enemy wait all fair occasions to give Boadicia battell being unwilling to try his fortune too suddenly multitude and successe making the Britans outrageously daring In the interim neverthelesse raising what forces the exigency of so important affairs would permit Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Ner C s fo Which way Suetonius marched from London is altogether omitted yet if lawfull to conjecture why not to draw off the Forces of Catus Decianus Procurator not long before fled into Gaul for fear of this War together with the remains of Petilius Cerealis troops quartered as Anonymus confesseth in those very camps yet appearing about Gildsbrough and Daintry in Northamptonshire then confining the Icenian Dominion to the Westward Which Troops therefore lay doubtlesse in very great danger if not timely relieved especially in case Boadicia should conduct her Army that way as ere long afterwards she did so far as Verulam this course being taken by her not improbably in pursuit of Suetonius Neither was it very dangerous for the Roman Generall to lead his Forces that way the Enemies main strength lying about Camalodunum Howsoever whether he marched up to them or no concluded it is he made his retreat towards P nius Posthumus encamped with the second Legion in the borders of the Silures now Herefordshire Radnorshire c for which Legion Suetonius sending to have it brought up to his Rendezvouz his commands being slighted that strength failed him The way which Suetonius took after his departure was in mine opinion saith Anonymus towards Severn where P nius Posthumus encamped with the second Legion among the Silures So also Spencer our famous English Poet finds it Whereby it appears Suetonius retreat was not Westward to Salisbury Plains but Northerly towards that second Legion In this retreat I may not omit Anonymus conducts him over the Thames at London which if granted and that he kept the river upon his right hand still untill engaging Boadicia as Anonymus saith he did then was Suetonius march far away indeed from Salisbury Plain The course of that River winding as we all know through Barkshire out of Oxfordshire where Tame from the County Buckingham and Isis from the edge of Glocester Province make their conjunction a little beneath Dorchester And if keeping this course still by the Rivers side Suetonius marcht alongst the banks of Cherwell also then must Anonymus whether he will or no bring him up close to Gildsbrough and Daintry as aforesaid and thereby for it is admitted Cerealis horse troops were at the fight reconciling all opinions upon his direct way towards the second Legion How far on neverthelesse toward P nius Posthumus Camp Suetonius advanced is uncertain but that the battell might be fought in some Plain about Verulam or upon that rode is not altogether improbable Especially considering part of Suetonius strength consisted of Londoners who as Auxiliaries followed him in this War and would not stay behind For the Roman Generall when marshalling his Army for fight had with him saith Tacitus the aids of the places adjoyning What places were these the last place named by him was Verulam the next place before it London and if the Historian intends either of these two by the places adjoyning to the field where the battell fought then may Anonymus prove the desarts in Africa as soon as the Plains of Salisbury to be the place of Battell Sidenote Cant Spencer saith the battell was fought near Severn Which seeing stout Bunduca up arose And taking arms the Britons to her drew With whom she marched straight against her foes And them vnwares besides the Seuerne did enclose Sidenote Tacit Ann lib Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Ner C s fo Suetonius when resolving for fight deligit locum artis faucibus tergo silv clausum satis cognito nihil hostium nisi in fronte apertam planitiem esse sine metu insidiarum Choosed a place with a narrow entrance enclosed behind with a wood being well assured he had no enemies but before him and the Plain being open was without fear of Ambush Thus Tacitus describes the field the Roman Army consisting of scarce ten thousand armed men In what part of Britan soever this Plain lay it was for certain of no great extent being hardly able to contain the vast multitudes of Boadicia s Army computed two hundred and thirty thousand fighting men by Dion and therefore could not possibly be Salisbury Plain For the Britans placing their carts and wagons supra extremum ambitium campi in the utmost borders of the field had so environed their Army therewith that upon the rout given they could hardly flee away quia circumjecta vehicula sepserant abitus by reason the carts saith Tacitus hedged in the passages on every side and to use Anonymus own words were like a wall against evasion Now if the Britans had so surrounded the utmost borders of Salisbury Plain and in such manner barricado d up all the passages thereof their numbers should rather have been millions then thousands as every man knowing those Plains must needs confesse Besides Anonymus self tels us after the Britans in the head of their battel began to shrink and turn that alone was a blow to all behind who being many score of thousands remain d untoucht during the fight because they could never come up to handy strokes for want of room in the narrowings of the field He told us even now there was scope enough Whereabout in these parts of Britain saith he that very place was unlesse it were upon Salisbury Plain where there is a black heath and scope enough is not for me to imagine Now on the contrary when coming to the issue he tels us the Plain was narrow and they wanted room Did the Britans want room in the field and were on Salisbury Plain Surely in the heat of his describing the Battel Anonymus forgot his own invention the fury of the Romans in beating down the British squadrons therewith dasht the main force of his conceit to peeces Suspicious and jealous men had need of good memories Upon the aforesaid situation he might rather have observed the great experience of the Romane Generall in martiall affairs then from thence suggested the Britans in point of honour erected Stoneheng to the memory of Boadicia Suetonius not onely choosing to make good a straight enclosed behinde with a wood for securing his own small Troops but such a straight also where the Plain or field before it was not of sufficient extent for Boadicia to marshall her great Army in Furthermore Anonymus determining it seems to parcell out his ground proportionable to the numbers undertakes to give posterity an exact survey of this Plain telling us it was a Plain of five or six miles over This makes it more apparent twas not Salisbury Plain which far and wide so expatiates it self through the middle of Wiltshire that it is not onely five or six miles but as I may say five times six miles over This famous battell then being struck upon a Plain hardly capable of Boadicia s Army was not fought upon Salisbury Plain but on some other which Suetonius Paulinus found best for his own advantage and therefore Stoneheng as Anonymus would fain have it could not be the Sepulchre of Boadicia Sidenote Dion Cass lib Concerning Boadicia s magnificent obsequies a mighty Prince may be buried with great solemnity yet no materiall Monument dedicated to his memory Examples of this kinde are so frequent there needs no mention of them Humaverunt magnific they are Dions words the Britans laid her into the earth magnificently with as much pomp happily and honour attending her to the grave as their barbarous customs for their glorious Chieftain would admit but that they raised any Monument or erected whatsoever kinde of Sepulchre for her much lesse so notable a structure as Stoneheng he no where tels us Which had the Britans done the Historian could not avoid taking more knowledge thereof then of her bare enterment and would undoubtedly have recorded it Again grant Salisbury Plain the place of Battell yet Dion saith not they buried her magnificently where the battell fought only Humaverunt magnific adding withall those that escaped the field prepared to re enforce themselves for a new triall in the mean while a disease seizing on Bunduica she died Now then after so terrible an overthrow wherein tis reported she lost fourscore thousand Britans Boadicia in all likelihood endevoured to recover the Icenian Countreys her principall strength having in her speech before the Battell insinuated the fenny parts thereof as a refuge if the worst should happen In what Countreys else could they recruit where falling sick she died whether by violent or naturall death is not materiall and as ever observed among all Nations was no doubt buried in her own territories among the graves of her renowned Ancestors Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Sueton in Ner Sidenote Dion Cas lib That the Britans untill Julius Agricolas time had learned nothing as Anonymus takes speciall notice but to fight and were no handicraftsmen whereby they might be capable of erecting such works as Stoneheng being already fully proved from Tacitus I will adde the ringleaders or heads of commotions against Empires and Commonwealths were anciently in many Countreys at this day not only themselves punishable by the Laws with death but their whole families and kindred though guiltlesse suffered in like manner their very houses also being razed to the ground lest any knowledge of such pernicious undertakings should remain visible to posterity and a capitall crime it was in whomsoever that restor d them How comes it then Boadicia the principall promoter and Head of an insurrection so fatall as accounted by Suetonius Tranquillus among the infortunate losses of the Roman Empire and the more ignominious by a womans conduct should be permitted by the conquering Romans a monument to eternize her fame to succeeding Ages Boadicia that ript up the bellies of the Roman Legionaries and cutting out their bowels impal d their bodies upon burning stakes that hanged up the most noble and honourable Roman Dames naked and slicing off their paps sowed them to their mouths as in act of eating them that in scalding water boiled the Roman infants and young children to death their Parents Husbands and Commanders unable to relieve them but enforced to give way and happy in so saving themselves from the cruell inhumanities of the Conqueresse We fought for to live saith Tacitus Yet when ere long afterwards victoriously recovering Britain to C sar by so memorable a battell as compared to their victories of old should the Romans suffer the enthralled Britans to erect a Trophy to her memory whose purpose was absolutely to root out all that was Roman here what greater infamy to the Roman name except the permission of it They who rased and broke in peeces whatever titles and inscriptions bearing the names of their C sars pulled down and demolished the royall Ensigns Trophies Statues Temples or whatever else sacred to their own Emperors when actively administring to the prejudice of the Romane State would they permit any publick monuments be erected to the memory of a conquered Prince of an Enemy so barbarously cruell as Boadicia That she lives in History they could not prevent so live their worst of Emperors Moreover publick Monuments were in all ages set up in honour of the Vanquishers not vanquished respecting which Anonymus should also either have made Boadicia Victresse or never supposed Stoneheng her Sepulchre Sidenote Ner C s fo Sidenote Tacit Ann lib The time assigned by Anonymus for erecting these orderly irregular and formlesse uniform heaps of massive marble as he cals them to the everlasting remembrance of Boadicia is much above fifteen hundred years since Petronius Turpilianus succeeding Suetonius Paulinus in the Leivtenancy of Britain who by his idle and lazy life making the world beleeve there was peace here Anonymus will have it a proper time for permitting such an office to the Britans in Boadicia s honour Times of peace tis confest when Arts flourish under nobly minded Governours are chiefly proper for erecting magnificent buildings The Government under Petronius was guilty of none of these As for the State of Britain in generall Tacitus in the life of Agricola tels us Petronius had composed the former troubles but in what sort the fourteenth book of his Annals declares non irritato hoste neque lacessitus neither the Enemy incensed him nor he provoked the Enemy otherwise Petronius durst not do And if peace setled why doth the Historian call them Enemies Concerning his own person in particular Petronius gave himself over to an unprofitable life disguising it under the honourable name of peace Honestum pacis nomen segni otio imposuit saith Tacitus And the Britans as said before were not then civilized nor friends to such Arts as either nourish or are nourished by peace therefore such a work of wonder as this Antiquity famed not to be expected from them For as through the malignities of the Age wherein Aurelius Ambrosius lived the Britans had utterly lost the practice of all those Sciences in times foregoing learned by their Auncestors from the Romans so through the neglect of civil policy in the preceding Roman Governours in this Leivtenancy of Petronius the Britans had not attained the knowledge of any those Arts not many years afterwards taught their posterity by the Romans Whole imperiall Eagles took not wing in Britain with such lofty speed as over other Countreys The Britans being a fierce Nation slowly giving ear to any peace the Romans had work enough in subduing them Julius C sar rather shewed the Island to his successors then left them possession of it Augustus and Tiberius held it policy to neglect it Caligula intending to invade Britain was diverted by his Wars in Germany Claudius first prosecuting the conquest with effect established the colony at Camalodunum and his Leivtenants Aulus Plautius Flavius Vespasianus Ostorius Scapula and Didius Gallus by little and little after much contest and various successe subdued certain Countries and reducing the nearest part of the Island to the form of a Province built also or rather cast up some few fortifications further within the land Nero s Generals had much to do in keeping what their predecessors gained Suetonius Paulinus under him struck that fortunate battell with Boadicia else the Romans beaten out of all So that in the time of Petronius the Romans having obtained no such assured dominion over the Britans as might make them themselves confident to undertake great and stately buildings here for their own either publick or private accommodations the ruine of Camalodunum being too fresh in memory occasion was not offered nor the time yet come to let the Britans know by what Arts all civill Nations of the world did erect their excessive rather then not magnificent structures for eternizing their names to succeeding generations And therefore the Leivtenancy of Petronius Turpilianus not proper for building this stony marvell as Anonymus suspects For beside what s delivered whensoever Stoneheng built the preparation only of materials for the work and bringing them to the place what Engines or Arts soever used necessarily spent more time then Petronius consumed in the whole continuance of his government here What tumults succeeded him let others declare Sidenote Suet in Vespas Furthermore if those times of Petronius would not yet saith Anonymus other ensuing seasons might permit such an office to the Britans her name for ever glorious among them The hainousnesse of her Rebellion horridnesse of her cruelties and inveterate hatred Boadicia bore to the Romans whereby her name for ever infamous among them clearly manifest all other ensuing seasons equally improper for those ancient inhabitants of this Island to erect Stoneheng If the Britans once attaining the Romane manner of Architecture in any succeeding times had expelled the Romans and been triumphant some probable reason at least Anonymus might have alledged towards advancing his opinion But Boadicia and her Complices overthrown the Roman Power in this Island encreasing dayly and the liberty of the Britans as fast declining no following season could be opportunely favourable for undertaking such a work by them the erecting whereof yea the sole endeavouring to commemorate by such publick means so mortall an enemy to the Romans as Boadicia nothing but the dearest lives of the bold attempters could certainly expiate The Temple upon Mount C lius at Rome begun to Claudius sacred memory by Agrippina was destroyed to the very foundations by Nero If then insulting Agrippina might not erect a memorable structure to the glory of her deceased C sar whom the Senate and People of Rome in all solemne manner deified What oppressed Britan durst undertake the raising a publick Monument to the honour of vanquished Boadicia whom the State in all reason for ever declared enemy to the Roman Empire And though after a long succession of years the Romans abandoned this Island yet when departed the Britans were left in such deplorable condition at large declared before that albeit her name never so glorious among them they had much more to do in saving their own miserable lives from plague famine and the sword then any opportunity or ability to erect whatever Monument to the glory of Boadicia But of this enough the invalidity of Anonymus opinion especially respected The discovering the originall foundation of an Antiquity so famous being not to be enforced by jealous suspicions raised upon bare and groundlesse conjectures This Antiquity call d by Henry Huntingdon The second by Poly olbion First wonder of the land because the Architraves are set upon the heads of the upright stones and hang as it were in the air is generally known by the name of Stone heng It is sited upon the Plain in the County of Wiltshire in England not far from Ambresbury the foundations of whose ancient buildings frequently digged up render it to have been in times past a Town of no small fame six miles at least from new Salisbury northwards The whole work in generall being of a circular form is one hundred and ten foot diameter double winged about without a roof anciently environed with a deep Trench still appearing about thirty foot broad So that betwixt it and the work it self a large and void space of ground being left it had from the Plain three open entrances the most conspicuous thereof lying North east At each of which was raised on the outside of the Trench aforesaid two huge stones gate wise parallel whereunto on the inside two others of lesse proportion The inner part of the work consisting of an Exagonall figure was raised by due symmetry upon the bases of four equilaterall triangles which formed the whole structure this inner part likewise was double having within it also another Exagon raised and all that part within the Trench sited upon a commanding ground eminent and higher by much then any of the Plain lying without and in the midst thereof upon a foundation of hard chalk the work it self was placed Insomuch from what part soever they came unto it they rose by an easie ascending hill Which that it may be the more clearly demonstrated being by me with no little pains and charge measured and the foundations thereof diligently searched I have reduced into Design not onely as the ruine thereof now appears but as in my judgement it was in its pristine perfection And that the groundplot with the uprights and profyle of the whole work may the more distinctly be understood I have purposely countersigned each Design of them with Numbers and the particular parts thereof with Letters Nu Signifies the Plant of the whole work in generall with the Trench round about it drawn by a small scale that it may be seen all at

and lying towards the East four foot broad and sixteen foot in length Which whether it might be an Altar or no I leave to the judgement of others because so overwhelmed with the ruines of the Work that I could make no search after it but even with much difficulty took the aforesaid proportion thereof Yet for my part I can apprehend no valid reason to the contrary except that the whole constructure being circular in form the Altar should rather have been placed upon the center of the Circle then enclining to the circumference Neverthelesse it cannot be denied but being so sited the Cell as I may call it was thereby left more free for the due performance of those severall superstitious rites which their Idolatry led them to Besides though the Altare amongst the Ancients was exalted and raised somwhat high above the earth yet their Ara was made quadrangular not very high and as some will have it close to the ground being consecrated as well to the supernall as infernall Deities and therefore in respect of the form it may hold well enough it was anciently an Altar D The supposed Altar E The great stones which made the entrances from the outside of the Trench seven

in height cannot be distinguisht much lesse exactly measured G The scale of fifty foot The Design follows Illustration Nu The Groundplot of the work as when first built in a greater form with the foure equilaterall triangles making the Scheame by which the whole work was composed H The six principall entrances three whereof directly opposite to those of the Trench I The stones which made the outward Circle seven foot in breadth three foot and an half thick and fifteen foot and an half high each stone having two tenons mortaised into the Architrave continuing upon them throughout the whole circumference For these Architraves being joynted directly in the middle of each of the perpendicular stones that their weight might have an equall bearing and upon each side of the joynt a tenon wrought as remains yet to be seen it may positively be concluded thereby the Architrave continued round about this outward circle K The smaller stones of the inner circle one foot and an half in bredth one foot thick and six foot high These had no Architraves upon them but were raised perpendicular of a pyramidall form That there was no Architrave upon these may be hence concluded the stones being too small to carry such a weight the spaces being also too wide to admit of an Architrave upon them without danger of breaking and being but six foot high there could not possibly be a convenient head height remaining for a passage underneath especially considering fully the greatnesse of the whole work L The stones of the greater Hexagon seven foot and an half in breadth three foot nine inches thick and twenty foot high each stone having one tenon in the middle M The stones of the Hexagon within two foot six inches in breadth one foot and an half thick and eight foot high in form pyramidall like those of the inner circle The Scale which hath this mark X is of thirty foot by which likewise all the ensuing Designs are drawn The Design follows Illustration Nu The upright of

stones of the Hexagon and mortaised also into them sixteen foot long three foot nine inches broad and three foot four inches high This Architrave continuing onely from stone to stone left betwixt every two and two a void space free to the Air uncovered For if they had been continued throughout the whole Hexagon then necessarily there must have been two tenons upon each of the said stones as those of the outward circle had but being disposed as aforesaid that one which was in the middle and yet remains apparent was sufficient for the thing intended Nu The Profyle or cut through the middle

and injury of weather are for the most part standing at this day which though not all at their full height as when first set up yet the Footsteps neverthelesse of so many of them as exprest in the Design are still remaining in their proper places Those of the inner circle and lesser Hexagon not only exposed to the fury of all devouring Age but to the rage of men likewise have been more subject to ruine For being of no extraordinary proportions they might easily be beaten down or digged up and at pleasure made use of for other occasions Which I am the rather enduced to beleeve because since my first measuring the work not one fragment of some then standing are now to be found Nu The Ruine yet remaining drawn in Prospective P The manner of the tenons of a round form mortaised into the

those times when first erected and by which the memory of things especially made over to succeeding Ages being either not written or if written utterly lost Likewise as for what use set up not yet known so by whom also founded is equally uncertain You cannot but remember in what manner the ancient Inhabitants of this Island lived before reduced to civility by the Romans I have formerly delivered also how they were first instructed by them in severall Arts and Sciences whereof the Britans wholly ignorant before the Romans arrivall here and teaching them I have given you in like manner a full description of this Antiquity whereby doubtlesse it appears to you as in truth it is a work built with much Art Order and Proportion That the ancient Britans before the discovery of this Island by the Romans could not be the Founders thereof by the former reasons I suppose is clearly manifested For where Art is not nothing can be performed by Art As for that which concerns the British Nobility Aurelius Ambrosius or Boadicia enough already It rests now to endeavor the discovering by whom Stoneheng built in what time and for what use anciently erected But it is not expected I hope any absolute resolution should be given by me in so doubtfull a matter for as it hath been always lawfull for every man in such like matters saith Camden both to think what he will and relate what others have thought So pardon me if I take upon me what others have done before me and interpose mine own opinion also grounded neverthelesse upon such Authorities customes and concurrence of time as very probably may satisfie judicious and impartiall Readers Sidenote Pausan fo Sidenote Idem fo Sidenote In Vitr lib Touching the Founders of Stoneheng Among the gyptian Antiquities or those Eastern Nations from whom the Gr cians deduced their learning I find not any such composure ever used or with the Greeks themselves mention made of any work conformable to this in point of Order as the mod conversant in those Histories cannot contradict I read neverthelesse in Pausanias of a Temple amongst the Eleans erected without walls novam quandam in Eleorum foro templi formam vidi I saw saith he in the market place of the Eleans a Temple of a new form Modic est des altitudinis sine parietibus tectum quercu dolatis fulcientibus tibicinibus A low thing without walls having the roof supported with props of oaken timber instead it seems of Columnes neatly wrought He remembers a Temple also in Attica sacred to Jove without a roof The Thracians as I read likewise used to build Temples dedicated to Sol of a round form open in the middle and also without a roof by the form or roundnesse thereof they signified the Suns figure by making them open and rooflesse they expressed his surmounting and dilating light equally to all things Thraces soli rotunda templa faciebant saith Daniel Barbaro in medio sub divo aperta erant hac forma Solis figuram innuebant qu d autem aperta essent sine tecto innuebant Solem supra omnia esse lumen suum diffundere Sidenote Scamoz lib fo Sidenote Camden fo Howsoever considering what magnificence the Romans in prosperous times anciently used in all works both publick and private their knowledge and experience in all Arts and Sciences their powerfull means for effecting great works together with their Order in building and manner of workmanship accustomed amongst them Stoneheng in my judgement was a work built by the Romans and they the sole Founders thereof For if look upon this Antiquity as an admired and magnificent building who more magnificent then the Romans Essi soli fr i populi dell vniverso con ogni termine di magnificenza edificarono tutti i generi d edifici They only amongst all the Nations of the Universe erecting all sorts of buildings with all kinds of magnificence saith Scamozzo in the first Book of his Architecture If consider the Art and elegant disposition thereof all Arts and Sciences we must know were in full perfection with them and Architecture which amongst the Greeks was youthfull only and vigorous under the Romans their Empire grown to the full height became manly and perfect not in inventions and elegancy of forms alone but also in exquisitenesse of Art and excellency of materials Salito al colmo l imperio Romano ella pure divenne virile e perfetta non solo nelle inventioni e nella elleganza delle forme m parimente nell esquisitezza dell artificio e nella singolarit della materia As the same Author hath it If take notice of their power and ways by which they effected such goodly structures their means were not ordinary according to the common custome of other People and why because besides particular Artisans practised in severall Arts they employed in those their works whole bodies of their own Armies and whatever Nations subdued by them The Romans were wont to exercise therein saith Camden their Souldiers and the common multitude upon great policy doing the same left being idle they should grow factious and affect alteration in the State The Britans complained saith Tacitus likewise corpora manus contrivisse that their bodies and hands were worn out and consumed by the Romans in bringing to effect their great and admired undertakings in that kind employing their slaves and prisoners also as holding it rather then by violent deaths to cut them off more profitable for the Commonwealth more exemplary for others and far greater punishment for their Prisoners to enjoyn them continuall labour Sidenote Choul fo If observe their Order in building the only Order of Architecture which Italy may truly glory in the invention of is the Tuscane Order so called because first found out by the Tuscans that in a more then ordinary manner they might reverence their Deities in Temples composed thereof Janus their first King according to the common opinion of divers ancient Historians being the first of all others that built Temples to the Gods Which Order though first used by the Tuscans certain it is the Romans took from them and brought it in use with other Arts in severall parts of the world as their conquests led them on Now of this Tuscan Order a plain grave and humble manner of Building very solid and strong Stoneheng principally consists So that observing the Order whereof Stoneheng built there being no such Elements known in this Island as distinct Orders of Architecture untill the Romans introduced them the very work it self of so great Antiquity declares the Romans Founders thereof Who that hath right judgement in Architecture knows not the difference and by the manner of their works how to distinguish gyptian Greek and Roman structures of old also Italian French and Dutch buildings in these modern times Is not our Shipping by the mould thereof known throughout the world English built Who did not by the very Order of the work assure himself the body of the Church of S Paul London from its Tower to the West end anciently built by the Saxons as the Quire thereof from the said Tower to the East end by the Normans it being Gothick work yet that there might be a Roman Temple in old time standing in that place I will not deny the numbers of Oxeheads digged up and anciently sacrificed there setting all other reasons aside so probably manifesting the same And in all likelihood the Romans for so notable a structure as Stoneheng made choice of the Tuscane rather then any other Order not only as best agreeing with the rude plain simple nature of those they intended to instruct and use for which erected but also because presuming to challenge a certain kind of propriety therein they might take occasion thereby to magnifie to those then living the virtue of their Auncestors for so noble an invention and make themselves the more renowned to posterity for erecting thereof so well ordred a building Sidenote Vitr lib Besides the Order is not only Roman but the Scheam also consisting of four equilaterall triangles inscribed within the circumference of a Circle by which this work Stoneheng formed was an Architectonicall Scheam used by the Romans Whereof I shall have more occasion to speak when I come to set down for what use this Antiquity at first erected Again the Portico at Stoneheng is made double as in structures of great magnificence the ancient Romans used so at the foot of the Capitol the Temple to Jove the Thunderer built by Augustus C sar so the Pantheon at Athens royally adorned with one hundred and twenty vast columnes of rich Phrygian marble by the Emperour Adrian But some may alledge the Romans made the Pillars of their double Portico s of one and the same symmetry or very little different which in this Antiquity otherwise appearing cannot be a Roman work To as much purpose it may be alledged the Temple of Diana at Magnesia was no Greek work because the Pillars of the inner Portico were wholly left out Yet it s true the Romans usually made them as is objected and the reason was because of the weight the inner Pillars carried now in this work no roof being to be sustained nor any manner of weight born up though the judgement of the Architect thereby to save labour and expence ordered the stones making the Portico within of a far lesse proportion then those of the outward circle it retains neverthelesse the proper Aspect principally aim d at by the ancient Architects in use amongst the Romans and consequently for ought alledged to the contrary by them built Sidenote Vitr lib cap In this Antiquity there is a Portico also as I may rightly term it within the Cell or greater Hexagon reduced likewise into the same figure Now that the Romans used to make Portico s on the inside of their buildings as well sacred as secular by the ruines of their Basilicaes or Courts of Judicature by that Temple without a roof anciently dedicated to Jove in Mount Quirinalis now the Horse Mount in Rome by the Temple of Bacchus there of a round form at this day consecrate to S Agnes without the gate Viminalis manifestly appears But in what ever structures else the Romans used them certain it is within their most stately Temples which lay uncovered and had no roofs they always made such Portico s and though in other Temples they sometimes dispos d them yet from Vitruvius it may be gathered they properly belonged to the Aspect Hyp thros which was uncovered and rooflesse as this Antiquity Stoneheng he peremptorily assigning Portico s to be made on the inside of no kind of Temples but those His words are Hyp thros in interiore parte habet columnas remotas parietibus ad circuitionem ut porticus peristyliorum Temples open to the air and without roofs have columnes on the inside distant from the walls as Courts Portico s about them Even after the same decorum as at Stoneheng Furthermore if cast an eye upon their artifice and manner of workmanship Stoneheng appears built directly agreeable to those rules which the Romans observed in great works For the Roman Architects in distinguishing the manner of their Temples always observed as Vitruvius in his third book teacheth us the greater the Columnes were the closer they set them together so in this Antiquity the stones being great the spaces betwixt them are likewise narrow Sidenote Leo Bap Alber lib Sidenote Leo Bap Alber lib The Architraves also in this work were all of them set without morter and fixed upon the upright stones by tenons as formerly described in the very same manner as in great structures where the stones solid and of more then ordinary greatnesse the Romans were wont to doe They laid them without any unctuous incorporating matter nullo fulta glutino saith Leo Baptista Albertus And divers examples of this kind might be brought I my self amongst other Antiquities have seen the ruines of an Aquaeduct built by the Romans in Provynce running through a deep valley and raised in height equall to the adjacent Mountains upon huge Arches fifty eight foot wide the stones whereof being of extraordinary scantlings were laid without any cement or morter to incorporate them with the rest of the work And where occasion guided their judgements to the observance of this rule they united and compared the stones together by certain ligatures or holdfasts the Italians call them Perni pegs or tops for such they resemble and we from the verb tenere to hold not improperly calling them tenons qu inferiores un superiores in lapides infix cavat fuere ne quid fort protrusi ordines alteri ab alteris distrahantur Which saith Albertus being formed in the inferiour stones were hollowed or mortaised into those above left by any chance they should start one from another and break the order of the work Here the Florentine Architect gives us the self same manner of banding stones when the Romans laid them without morter as if he had seen this very Antiquity Stoneheng Sidenote Camden Sidenote Speed Moreover what ever footsteps of the Romans found in other places of this Island it s not inconsiderately to be past over that in Wiltshire the County as is said before where our Stoneheng remains Roman Antiquities are most perspicuous not only by the apparent testimonies of the coyns of their Emperors in divers places digged up but by severall their encamping places yet to be seen as Leckham in times of yore a seat of the Romans the place also where old Salisbury now sheweth it self within six miles of Stoneheng and within three miles thereof Yanesbury Castle supposed a work of Vespasians when he conquered and after kept in subjection the Belg ancient inhabitants of that tract Likewise the mines nearer yet to Stoneheng of a fortresse our Historians hold anciently a garrison of the Romans and in many other forts of that Shire both by their form and manner of making well known to have been Roman the tract of their footing is yet left Sidenote Cam fo Sidenote Tacitus Sidenote Beda But it is objected If Stoneheng a Roman work how comes it no Roman Author makes mention of it I answer their Historians used not to commit to writing every particular work or action the Romans performed if so how vast would their volumes have been Stoneheng tis granted is much admired by us yet how far more admirable works were the Romans Founders of not mentioned in any of their ancient stories That notable bridge invented and built by C sar for passing his Army over the Rhine himself at large describes remembring little or nothing neverthelesse concerning divers other as great works in Gaul and Batavia suppos d to be performed by him also Dion Herodian Eutropius and other their Historians tell us the Romans built the so famed wall commonly by us called the Picts wall extending crosseover our Island from the Irish Sea to the German Ocean above fourscore Italian miles in length with many towers and fortresses erected upon it when works of as great admiration in Britain they have past in silence those wonderfull causeys made throughout the land by dreining and drying up Fens levelling hils raising valleys and paving them with stones of such breadth that Wains might without danger passe one by another not any ancient Roman Author for ought appears directly mentioning Yet who doubts them Roman works I dare confidently avouch the Romans by little and little founded and raised them up saith Camden And why mark I pray because whilst Agricola governed Britain Tacitus tels us severall ways were enjoyned If then because Tacitus affirms in generall terms only severall ways enjoyned Camden confidently concludes them Roman works no Roman History otherwise remembring them Why may it not the same Tacitus telling us in like manner Agicola exhorted the Britans in private and helpt them in common to build Temples Houses and Places of publick resort as peremptorily be inferr d Stoneheng was a work built by the Romans though not particularly remembred by them in their stories In a word Temples and places of publick resort the Romans built here and were the first that did so leaving it to after ages to find out by their Manner of building Order in building and Power and Means for building such lofty ruines as appears in this Antiquity could be remains of none but Roman building Sidenote Camden fo The next thing to be enquired after is in what time Stoneheng built Happily about those times when the Romans having setled the Country here under their own Empire and together with bringing over Colonies reduced the naturall inhabitants of this Island unto the society of civill life by training them up in the liberall Sciences For then also saith Camden did they furnish the Britans with goodly houses and stately buildings in such sort that the reliques and rubbish of their ruines cause the beholders now exceedingly to admire the same and the common sort of People plainly say those Roman works were made by Giants of such exceeding great admiration and sumptuous magnificence they are This relation of Camdens reflects chiefly upon the time of Agricola neverthelesse that Stoneheng though fabled Giants work was then built I dare not affirm the great works of the Romans brought to perfection in this Island being not the work of a day It hath been the invention of wise Romans of old affecting civility to raise goodly buildings here but the precise times when in things so far from all knowledge cannot be with any certainty avouched For my part I should choose to assign those times for building thereof when the Romans in their chief prosperity most flourished here and refer the first erection to the time betwixt Agricolas government formerly mentioned and the reign of Constantine the Great in order to which the times rather somwhat after Agricola if not during his own Lievtenancy then next preceding Constantine For long before Constantine acquired the Soveraignty which was not till the year of our Lord three hundred and ten the magnificent splendor of that mighty Empire began sensibly to wane and the ambition of the great Captains of Rome some few excepted tended rather to make parties for obtaining the Purple Robe then after the manner of their ancestors to eternise their names by great and admirable works or patronizing good Arts for want whereof they began likewise to decay apace Serly in his third Book speaking of those times telling us that id temporis Architecti si cum superioribus conferantur rudiores ineptiores extitisse videntur In those days although there were many Architects yet compared with such as lived in the preceding Ages they were very rude and unskilfull Besides the condition wherein this Island was divers years preceding Constantine would not admit such undertakings For by the civil discord of the Romans the Britans taking occasion to make frequent revolts in hope to recover their lost liberty the Romans were put upon other manner of Councels then to think of building namely to reduce the Britans to their wonted obedience and keep the Province in some reasonable quiet by expelling the Scots and Picts savage and perfidious People even from times of old making daily inroads and incursions thereunto Sidenote Gildas Now as for these reasons it s not likely Stoneheng could be built in the times next before Constantine so by what follows it will manifestly appear it was not erected after his Reign For after his transplanting the seat of the Empire into the East and the government of the then known world under the Romans distinguished by East and Western Emperours a deluge of barbarous Nations like so many Locusts swarmed over all Who as with their vast multitudes they oft had formerly attempted it so thence forward till bringing that mighty Empire unto its finall and fatall period and thereby utterly destroying in like manner all Arts and Sciences together with Architecture not restored again even in Italy it self untill as formerly remembred they never desisted Moreover in the times after Constantine no Temples to Heathen Deities such as I shall make appear this Antiquity Stoneheng was were erected here they being times of defacing rather then erecting idolatrous places For most of the succeeding Emperors becoming Christians the tempestuous storms of perfection were over and the thick clouds of superstition beginning to be dissolved by the bright beams of the Gospel and true light of CHRIST every where Temples were shut up against false Gods and set open to the true GOD According to that of Gildas No sooner was the blustering tempest and storm of persecution blown over but the faithfull Christians who in the time of trouble and danger had hidden themselves in woods deserts and secret caves being come abroad in open sight renovant Ecclesias ad solum usque destructas basilicas sanctorum martyrum fundant construunt perficiunt c Churches ruinate to the very ground they reedifie Temples of holy Martyrs they found build and finish c So that in stead of idolatrous Temples built in the Ages preceding Constantine during his reign and after whilst the Romans continued in any prosperous state here by erecting Christian Churches they began generally to neglect and suffer fall to decay rather then new build Temples to their Pagan Gods Sidenote Tacit in Vit Agr These pressing occurrences therefore to wit civill broyls amongst the Romans themselves frequent insurrections of the Britans daily inrodes by the Picts and Scots together with the downfall of Paganism decay of Arts and fatall ruine of the whole Empire making the times both long before and after Constantine incompatible for undertaking such works as this Antiquity it may safely enough be concluded if Stoneheng not founded by Agricola yet created it might be about fifteen hundred and fifty years ago in the times somewhat after his government the Province being formerly left by him in good and peaceable state the Britans reduced from Barbarity to order and civill conversation and the Romans flourishing in all manner of Arts and Sciences Sidenote Vitr lib cap Sidenote Plin lib Sidenote Tom lib Tom Sidenote Rosin lib Sidenote Choul fol Now concerning the use for which Stoneheng at first erected I am clearly of opinion it was originally a Temple it being built with all accommodations properly belonging to a sacred structure For it had an intervall or spacious Court lying round about it wherein the Victimes for oblation were slain into which it was unlawfull for any profane person to enter it was separated from the circumadjacent Plain with a large Trench in stead of a wall as a boundary about the Temple most conformable to the main work wholly exposed to open view Without this Trench the promiscuous common multitude with zeal too much attended the ceremonies of their solemne though superstitious Sacrifices and might see the oblations but not come within them It had likewise its peculiar Cell with Portico s round about into which Cell as into their Sanctum sanctorum pardon the expression none but the Priests entred to offer Sacrifice and make atonement for the People Within the Cell an Ara or Altar was placed having its proper position towards the East as the Romans used Ar spectent ad Orientem saith Vitruvius And that there hath been the heads of Bulls or Oxen of Harts and other such beasts digged up or in or near this Antiquity as divers now living can testifie is not to be omitted for who can imagine but these were the heads of such as anciently there offered in Sacrifice together with which also were heaped up great quantities of Charcole happily used about the performance of their superstitious ceremonies That the ancient Romans had Charcole in use amongst them Pliny affirms And when I caused the foundations of the stones to be searched my self found and yet have by me to shew the cover of a Thuribulum or some such like vase I suppose wherein Choul in his discourse of their Religion reports the ancient Romans used to carry Incense wine or holy water for service in their Sacrifices lying about three foot within the ground near one of the stones of the greater Hexagon Sidenote Vitr lib cap The Order whereof this Temple consists according to the rules of Art observed by the ancient Romans in works of this kinde is mingled of Greek and Tuscane work For as the plainnesse and solidnesse of the Tuscane Order appears eminently throughout the whole Antiquity so the narrownesse of the spaces betwixt the stones visibly discovers therein the delicacy of the Corinthian Order Which commixture amongst the Roman Architects was very usuall in regard Vitruvius in his fourth Book and seventh Chapter treating somwhat largely his method otherwise considered of severall sorts of the like composed Temples mixt of the Greek and Tuscane manners tels us that Nonnulli de Tuscanicis generibus sumentes columnarum dispositiones transferunt in Corinthiorum Ionicorum operum ordinationes Some taking the qualities of the columns of the Tuscane Order transfer them into the symmetry of the Corinthian and Ionick works Whereby to please themselves it seems in their own inventions efficiunt Tuscanicorum Gr corum operum communem ratiocinationem They make of the Tuscane and Greek works one common composure As the same Author likewise remembers Sidenote Vitr lib cap The Aspect of this Temple by which we understand that first shew which Temples make to those that draw near unto them is Dipteros Hyp thros which is double winged about uncovered Dipteros circa dem duplices habet columnarum ordines saith Vitruvius Dipteros hath double orders of columnes about the Temple Hyp thros sub divo est sine tecto as the same Author Hyp thros is open to the air without a roof Sidenote Vitr lib cap The Manner of this Temple is Pycnostylos or narrow spaces Pycnostylos is that kinde of Temples which hath the columnes set thick and close together crebris columnis as Vitruvius also hath it But it may be objected though it appears from very good Authorities the Artifice and workmanship of this Antiquity together with the Scheam which formed it were Roman and the Order of which consisting invented in Italy and so consequently Roman in like manner as also by the severall peculiar accommodations the probable reliques of Heathenish Sacrifices and determinate rules of Architecture it was anciently a Temple Neverthelesse it appears not the Romans ever used any whatever profane structure like this much lesse any manner of Temples of this kinde of invention Where the Temple lies open without walls surrounded only with pillars For that the upright stones which make this work Stoneheng are in stead of them may well enough be granted Sidenote Phil in Vitr lib To this I answer the learned in Antiquities very well know those things which oblivion hath so long removed out of mind are hardly to be discovered Yet as to the first part of the objection that the Romans never used any whatever profane structure like this Varro de re rustica as I find him cited by Philander tels us that they had in use amongst them a round building without any wals having a double Order of columns round about this he cals by the name of Tholus dificium rotundum columnatum duplici columnarum ordine A round edifice saith he environed about with a double order of columns Which double Order of Columns Pyrrho Ligorio a famous Neapolitane Architect and great discoverer of Antiquities in his description thereof designes without a roof also Sidenote Vitr lib cap Sidenote des sacr Templa dicta fuerunt qu d essent quasi des Deorum Rosin lib cap Sidenote Dan Barbar But to come to their sacred works which in regard of this Antiquity are it s true of most concernment I find the Romans used as Vitruvius witnesseth such manner of Temples For in his fourth Book and seventh Chapter he delivers there were amongst others two forms of round Temples commonly in use amongst them the one called Monopteros the other Peripteros This had the Cell enclosed about with a continued wall and at a proportionate distance from it the columns placed which made a Portico round about it clean different from Stoneheng the other made open and in stead of a wall encompassed with a row of pillars only having no enclosed Cell within it at all as much conducing to our purpose in hand His words are these Fiunt autem des rotund quibus ali sine cella columnat constituuntur They make also saith he round Temples of which some are built without a Cell environed with Pillars only These were without any wals as his Commenter hath it lying open to the Air And truly as I may presume to say from this very manner the invention of Stoneheng was principally taken in ordering whereof the Architect disdaining usuall and common forms of both the aforesaid forms composed one For taking the outward circle from the Monopteros he made it open also as in that but in stead of the continued wall circularly enclosing the Cell of the Peripteros at Stoneheng he made only an Hexagon about the Cell leaving the same open in like manner And as Hermogenes whom I shall have occasion to remember again to illustrate his work leaving out the inner row of Pillars made a single Portico about the Temple at Magnesia whereby it came to be a new invention for which he is famous to posterity so the subtile Architect whosoever he was to ennoble this his work adding the said Hexagon here made a double Portico round about this Temple and thereby a new invention likewise no lesse famous to succeeding Ages Our Antiquity Stoneheng had otherwise been of the self same Aspect without a Cell as Vitruvius hath before delivered That Temple Monopteros was environed with a row of pillars this Temple Stoneheng in stead of them supplied with a rank of pillasters as they may well be called continuing round about it That lay open to the air without any walls so doth this at Stoneheng That had over the pillars an Architrave Freese and Cornice the Order being delicate this at Stoneheng over the pillasters an Architrave only as most conformable to the solidnesse of the Order and plainnesse of the work Thus it fully appears the ancient Romans used to erect Temples which lay open without walls surrounded only with pillars in invention like this at Stoneheng But let us see whether the form Monopteros had any roof over it That the Romans had Temples uncovered and without roofs like Stoneheng is in part already and shall more manifestly be hereafter proved and searching curiously into their Antiquities it will be found the greatest most splendid and most magnificent work of all others which the Ancients made for service of their Deities were those kinde of Temples of the Aspect Hyp thros Whether the Monopteros was one of that kind appears not yet and Vitruvius is very obscure therein neverthelesse that it was built without a roof I shall illustrate by these reasons First Vitruvius tels us not it had a roof for in his precepts of all severall kinds of Temples after he hath delivered the Aspect Form and Manner of them with much exactnesse he omits not throughout his fourth Book to demonstrate aswell the contignation as proportion of timbers of the roofs belonging to all those Temples which had any and when vaulted he gives us likewise the form thereof if the Temples so covered but in the description of the form Monopteros there is no manner of timber work nor form of vault nor the least word mentioned of any roof at all in what place soever throughout his whole work speaking thereof In which respect considering all Temples having roofs those roofs are described by Vitruvius and that he describes no roof belonging to this it must necessarily follow the Temples in form Monopteros had no roofs over them Again after giving the proportion of the Architrave over the columnes of the Monopteros he saith Zophorus reliqua qu insuper imponuntur ita uti in tertio volumine de symmetriis scripsit The Freese and other ornaments laid upon them are as in his third Book of symmetries made mention of Now in his third Book he only treats of proportions and not one word is so much as mentioned by him of any manner of roofs at all only in the close of the said Book he gives the proportion of frontispices belonging to quadrangular Temples the same referment in like manner he makes for the ornaments of the Peripteros and withall proceeds to a full description in what manner the roof of its Cell was made which questionlesse he would likewise have done in the other form if it had been covered For he saith whatever is to be laid above the Freese of the Monopteros is as set down in his third Book but in his third Book there is not One word mentioned of any roofs the conclusion then follows the Monopteros was without a roof Sidenote Bern Baldo Lastly he positively tels us it was sine Cella without a Cell now the Cell and which for distinction sake I have so called in describing this Antiquity because it was applied to the same use to perform their sacred rites in was indeed properly the inner or chief part of the Temple quam nos corpus Templi vulg dicimus we commonly call it the body of the Church which enclosed with wals was covered with a roof as Vitruvius declares in the form Peripteros tecti ratio ita habeatur c The manner of a roof saith he was thus c But the Monopteros was without a Cell and consequently without a roof also as having no walls to bear it For in regard of the manner of the Architecture the pillars standing in Island as we say the work could not securely bear a roof if made of any great capacity either therefore they made Temples of this form very little in which respect only Palladio supposeth it might be vaulted inconsistent with the Roman greatnesse or else like Stoneheng they were wholly uncovered and rooflesse Howsoever it is manifest the Aspect was just the same And if I should say the ruines of one after the same form also remains yet in Oxfordshire which the common people usually call Rolle rich stones take it but as my conjecture only as likewise one or two built after the like manner in Scotland no man unlesse Hector Boetius knowing by what Kings Moreover the proportions appearing in this Antiquity Stoneheng are much conformable to those assigned by Vitruvius to the parts of the Monopteros He tels us Tribunal habent ascensum ex su diametri tertia parte they had the Tribunal by which is understood that levell upon which the Temple placed and the ascent consisting of one third part of the Diameter So at Stoneheng the work it self is one third part of the Diameter of the circumvallation And acording to the proportion allowed by him to the Ascent it seems those Temples were sited more stately then others by consequence great also and certain it is whosoever views this Antiquity attentively with judgement upon the place where remaining for the Folio being too little I could not expresse it in Design and doth allow a proportionate depth to the Trench surrounding it considering also together therewith the levell of the plain lying without he will then finde it standing upon such a rising ground that the Ascent unto it was not much lesse magnificent then what Vitruvius hath declared Furthermore besides the aforementioned round Temples Vitruvius in the same Chapter tels us that generibus aliis constituuntur des ex iisdem symmetriis ordinat alio genere dispositiones habentes The Romans built them after other manner of inventions following the same proportions and having their disposures after another kinde Of which if vouchsafed to posterity the descriptions some of them might have been found not only agreeable in Aspect but happily of the very self same form also as this Temple Stoneheng doth appear Now considering this discourse may happen into the hands of those who cannot by words so easily apprehend things of this Art I have for their satisfaction brought into Design the plants of both the aforesaid Temples mentioned by Vitruvius whereby their conformity with Stoneheng and the invention thereof taken from them is more clearly manifested A The Plant of the Monopteros B The Order of Pillars which continued round about it to which the outward circle of Pillasters in this Antiquity Stoneheng directly corresponds as will appear in the second Figure thereof formerly described by the Letter I The Design follows Illustration C The Plant of the Peripteros D The Portico continuing about the Cell E The Circular Cell enclosed with a wall which in the Temple Stoneheng to vary the invention was converted into an Hexagonall form and in stead of walling it round about the Architect as said before left it wholly open as most agreeing with the nature of the Deity to whom consecrate The Design follows Illustration By the Plants of which said Roman Temples although it is plainly manifest from whence the invention of Stoneheng was taken yet that it may more clearly be understood I have unto the Order of pillars which makes the Portico of the last of those Temples applied the Architectonicall Scheam by which our Antiquity was formed whereby the intersection of the severall triangles fully demonstrates after what manner the greater Hexagon made open at Stoneheng was raised from the solid wall environing the Cell of the Peripteros F The Rank of Pillars which made the Portico of the Peripteros G The Architectonicall Scheam by which Stoneheng formed H The circular wall environing the Cell of the Peripteros I After what manner the stones of the greater Hexagon at Stoneheng were raised from the circumference of the said wall The Design follows Illustration But before deliver my judgment unto which of their Deities this Temple Stoneheng was anciently dedicated by the Romans I shall give you some customs in force amongst the Ancients relating the Decorum used by them in building their particular Temples whereby those several opinions seemingly conclusive to whom Stoneheng sacred may more evidently appear invalid and my own more apparently probable Those therefore that endevour the searching out Antiquities of Architecture must amongst others especially prescribe to themselves five things to be guided by viz The Situation Aspect Manner Form and Order of the work as in use amongst the Ancients For inventing the severall ornaments of Architecture at first for honour and distinction onely of their Deities they appropriated to each of them particular situations precise forms peculiar Orders according to the severall qualities in regard whereof adored by them The situation of the Temples to Venus Mars Vulcan they ordained to be chosen without their Cities as those which moved mens minds to lasciviousnesse wars and devastations Within their Cities they placed the Temples of the Patrons of Chastity Peace good Arts and of such Gods also to whom the Protection of their Cities committed To Pallas Mercury and Isis the chief Presidents of Artificers and Merchants they built Temples near the Market places or upon the Market places themselves To Apollo and Bacchus near the Theater To Hercules near the Cirque or Amphitheater Unto sculapius and Salus in places most of all others healthfull and near to pure streams and waters because the infirm people coming out of a pestilent and contagious Aire to that which was good and healthfull by drinking those waters might the sooner and with lesse difficulty be recovered whereby zeal to those supposed Deities encreased The Aspect Hyp thros mentioned before of which Stoneheng appears built was proper only to some of their Gods as shall be remembred in due time the other five needlesse here to name were indifferently disposed sometime to one and sometime to another Deity as the magnificence of the Temples to be built required and as to be made with Portico s or without The Manner which Vitruvius distinguishes into five kinds according as the intercolumnes are of five severall proportions was only so far forth peculiarly appropriated to their Deities as it was agreeable to the proper Order otherwise they followed the greatnesse of the Work But to each of them appropriating particular forms of Temples to some of their Gods they made them of a round form to others quadrangular to others of many angles some of them having their Temples covered with roofs over them others again built uncovered without any manner of roofs at all As our Antiquity Stoneheng Lastly the Order of which they built them was so diligently observed according to the peculiar qualities of their Deities that seldom or never they varied as in fit place I shall remember These aforesaid rules also were so firmly observed by the Ancients that even at first sight the Roman Architects of old were able to judge to what Deity this or that Temple sacred and the modern Italian Architects by the ruines of them at this day give such notable testimonies towards the discovery of them as are very hardly to be contradicted Whosoever desires more of this may read Vitruvius Leo Baptista Albertus and other Authors writing of Architecture That then we may arrive to a degree of certainty unto whom our Stoneheng anciently dedicated some such Deitie of the Romans is to be found out in whose honour they built Temples not only in such situations as this at Stoneheng but with whole nature or quality the Form and Aspect thereof may be agreeable also and the Order proper For whosoever goes about to enforce other reasons do as I conceive but beat the air neither can they reduce this Antiquity to any probable Originall Sidenote Vitr lib cap Sidenote Fab Cal Sidenote Vitr lib cap To which of the Roman Deities Stoneheng consecrated are as I said before severall opinions Some presume it sacred to Diana but upon what ground their conjecture is raised considering both the Aspect and Manner of this Temple utterly different from those the Ancients used to dedicate to Her I cannot conceive for the Manner of the Temples erected to Diana was Diastylos i e columnis ampli s patentibus made with large and void spaces the Aspect of that at Ephesus was Dipteros that at Magnesia Pseudodipteros which Manner Hermogenes inventing to save expence and labour though he left out the Order of pillars within and thereby the Portico came to be more large yet the Aspect continued still the same And as in the Aspect and Manner so likewise in the Order and Form it s different that at Ephesus aforesaid being of the Ionick Order the Order peculiarly appropriated to Diana and quadrangular of the same Form also was that at Magnesia aforesaid and so likewise the Romans built them as by the now Church of S John Evangelist at the Latian or Latine Port anciently the Temple of Diana and that in Mount Aventine also the chief of her Temples in Rome fully appears The situation of the Temples dedicated to her was in groves whence Vitruvius cals her grovy Diana Ecce suburban templum nemorale Dian saith Ovid See where Diana s grovy Temple stands In which sort Virgil Pliny and other Authors also tell us her Temples were always sited The Architecture therefore of the Temples to Diana and this at Stoneheng being so far different there is no probable reason Stoneheng should be suppos d dedicated to her Sidenote Nat Com lib cap Sidenote Camden fo Sidenote Camden fo Sidenote Ibid fo Sidenote Strab li Sidenote Rosin lib cap Sidenote Camden fo Moreover whether or no this opinion maybe consistent with any of those qualities the Ancients endowed this Goddesse with let us examine further the Nature of the Deity it self Is Stoneheng consecrated to Diana because she presided over ways what publick roads then or common high ways are to be read of which anciently led over the Downs near this Antiquity The most ancient ways we meet with and which the Romans first made in this Island as Camden sets them down are four Watling street Ikemild street Ermin street and the Fosse Watling street led through Verolamium directly as it were by a streight line to the West side of Leicestershire and from thence through the Northerly Counties into Wales Ikemild street began in the Countrey of the Iceni tending Eastward Ermin street in the same quarter running through Cambridgeshire Huntingdonshire and so on towards Lincolnshire led the right way into the Northern Countreys on that side this street way happly may be that which among the inhabitants passeth now by the name of High Dike The Fosse passing through Warwickshire came down to Stow on the Would thence to Cirncester from Cirncester continuing on towards Bath and beyond it to Somerton into the Western Provinces the ridge whereof is yet to be seen in divers places of that tract All of them lying so far from Stoneheng that none of them are remembred to come nearer then Cirncester to any part of the Plains whereon it stands and therefore in this respect there can be no cause to imagine this Antiquity should be dedicated to her Or is Stoneheng sacred to Diana because she was the Patronesse of Gates for which reason the Ancients built her Temples either near to them within their Cities or not far from them in the pleasant suburbs But what Cities or places having any such Gates were ever found anciently so near Stoneheng as might cause the dedication of so great a work to her surely none Or is Stoneheng hallowed to Diana because she had the tutelage of Mountains if so then where are those Mountains to be found near this Antiquity on Salisbury Plains which Plains North South East and Westward through the midst of Wiltshire are so open that they terminate the Horizon If any such Mountains there why do all Historians call them Plains But admit Mountains somtimes on Salisbury Plain what then became of them were they removed by Earthquakes swallowed into the ground by an Hiatus of the earth or levell d by inundations then let it be made apparent when such like accidents fell out Or is Stoneheng dedicated to Diana because she delighted to bath her self in fountains and fresh springs where are those fountains and fresh springs to be found haply in the utmost borders they may be had none certainly in the body of the Plains or any thing near Stoneheng spring veins being not there to be found unlesse by sinking wells or pits very deep which the inhabitants are enforced to make in severall places for watering their sheep and as glad they are there as the Patriarchs of old in the deserts of Canaan to come by them Or is Stoneheng sacred to Diana because reputed Goddesse of hunting then who ever desirous of a Temple for her may finde it in Daphne the anciently famous suburbs of Antiochia where was not onely a Temple dedicated to her but an Asylum also as Strabo witnesseth such places only being held proper for her mysteries where interven d variety of pleasures goodly shadowy groves delicate walks and pleasant springs of most cool and fresh waters In the midst of these delights the Ancients sited her Temples not in wilde Downs or vast Plains so wide and open that hardly see from one side of them to another affording neither shelter for travellers against canicular heats nor succour for cattell against the boisterous blasts of blustering Boreas Lastly is Stoneheng dedicated to Diana because the supposed guardian of woods then remains it to be made apparent by them those Plains in ancient times bore another countenance then at present That they were full of Forrests woods and groves with variety of lawns replenished and stored with such sorts of game and wilde beasts in chase whereof Diana and her companions are said to recreate themselves from whence some are of opinion she was called Diana as much to say Deviana quoniam venantes per devia silvas deviare solent captantes feras Because of huntsmens deviating or wandring out of the way through uncouth paths and woods in pursuit of their game That those Plains afforded as much pleasure and delights as the Thessalian Tempe the Syrian Daphne or what place else as famous where her Temples anciently stood and in what unknown age they were disafforrested and laid wast Which if ever so certainly some signs thereof would remain or at least be found there as well as in other parts of the Island in times past overgrown with woods As in Anglesey formerly mentioned in Cheshire where in digging their marlepits are often found huge trees demonstrating to posterity the forrests there anciently growing in the Isle of Axholm in Lincolnshire where the inhabitants have hardly any fewell but what such trees afford so digged out of the earth in Somersetshire where I my self have seen trunks of trees lying under ground and expressing the places in times past overgrown with trees very few or none being in those places now standing Besides some remembrance of the aforesaid forrests and woods History questionlesse would yeeld now what occasion soever Historians take for mentioning this tract not one word is delivered by them to that purpose all unanimously consenting twas never other then at present an open and champion Countrey A Theater on which Bellona often displayed her bloody ensigns and acted severall tragedies in times of old A field of Mars where Romans Saxons and after Danes for obtaining the dominion of this Island decided their ambitious controversies Of which actions we have visible testimony unto this day witnesse those burrows and places where they cast the bodies of their slain over all quarters of the plain dispersed which in long time are so shrowded by nature with ever growing grasse that their memory will remain by their sepulchres to all posterity that which consumes all works of Art making them still more fresh and flourishing witnesse spoils of war there frequently digged up as formerly remembred severall encamping places of those severall Nations in all parts of the plain even yet appearing no place in the whole Island respecting the circuit having more remains of them Also that huge Trench mentioned before by the name of Wansdike running through the very bowels of them such manner of trenches appearing no where in any part of England beside saving where the like plains interveen so at Newmarket Heath the like trench vulgarly called Devils Dike as if made by Devils not by men is to be seen though in ancient times it was the limits of the Kingdome of the East Angles and it took end as Camden very well observes where the passages by reason of woods grew cumbersome Which if the like be granted for Wansdike as is very probable it ending also with the Plains then without controversie there were no more woods in times of old on Salisbury Plains then at this day it running overthwart them as in a direct line from East to West And who knows not that other manner of fortifications then running trenches upon direct lines are to be cast up for defence of woody situations But why urge more Authorities when the Inhabitants of the Countrey tell us the soil or ground being hot dry and chalky is altogether improper for the growth of trees Thus then the situation of the place so antipathizing in all respects with the nature and qualities anciently attributed to Diana and the Manner Form and Order of this Antiquity so contrary to the custome used by the Ancients in erecting her Temples no reason wherefore this Temple Stoneheng should be conceiv d as erected for celebration of the superstitious ceremonies anciently ascribed unto her Worship Some again would have Stoneheng consecrated to Pan because Pan a Greek word signifying the Universe under him the whole frame of Nature was adored And therefore the Ancients made his statues with horns saith Servius expressing thereby the beams of the Sun and horns of the Moon those issuing from his forehead and turning upwards towards Heaven as Boccace will have it signified the Celestiall bodies feigning also as the world moves with extraordinary swiftnesse he excelled likewise in speed of running By the purple ruddy and enflamed face attributed to Pan that pure fire above all other Elements holding his place in the confines of the Celestiall Sphears was demonstrated by his large long beard descending down upon his breast the two superiour Elements Aire and Fire of a masculine nature sending down their impressions upon the other two naturally feminine was shewed by the spotted skin covering his breast and shoulders the eighth sphear wholly embelished with glorious stars inveloping in like manner all appertaining to the nature of sublunary creatures was represented by the sheep hook which he held in one hand Natures dominion over all things according to Boccace was signified and as Servius saith because this staffe or rod was crooked the year revolving into it self was thereby expressed in the other hand holding a Pipe consisting of seven reeds whereby the Celestiall harmony conceived by some to have seven sounds and seven different tunes according to the number of the Planets and their Sphears which are seven was so set forth After this manner Mythologists discourse of Pan with various opinions according to the subtile niceties of their severall fancies and in these respects as having relation to the Heavens this Antiquity Stoneheng is imagined sacred to Him Tis true if Mythologie and not demonstrative reasons were to be fixt upon in matters of Architecture the former conceptions might be some ground to frame conjectures Stoneheng sacred to Pan But Architecture depending upon demonstration not fancy the fictions of Mythologists are no further to be embraced then as not impertinently conducing to prove reall truths Wherefore the aforesaid ancient rules for building Temples considered and comparing the Order Form Aspect and Situation of the Temples to Pan with the like in this Antiquity so much contrariety is found betwixt them as may convince any reasonable judgement Stoneheng not dedicated to Him Sidenote Nat Com lib Sidenote Dion Hali lib Sidenote Rosin lib Sidenote Pausan fo Sidenote Vitr lib cap Sidenote Alexan Don Sidenote Pomp Totti Sidenote Pausan fo Sidenote Ibid fo Pan pastorum venatorum univers vit rustican pr sidem crediderunt Antiqui saith Natalis Comes Pan was the reputed God amongst the Ancients of Shepherds Huntsmen and all those that led an agrestick life The same Author also calling him Piscatorum Deum the God of Fishermen as well as Shepherds Arcadibus Deorum antiquissimus honoratissimus est Pan saith Dionysius Pan is the most ancient and most honoured Deity of the Arcadians And in Arcadia itself where he was principally adored they built his Temples for the most part in Towns of the same Form and Order as to Juno In the Town of Her a habet Pan templum suum saith Pausanias in his description of Arcadia quod olim Junoni dicatum fuit Pan had his Temple which anciently was dedicated to Juno Now the Order appropriated to Juno by the Romans was the Ionick as is manifest from Vitruvius who tels us To Juno Diana and Bacchus and to the other Deities of the same quality they built Temples of the Ionick Order The Form in like manner of her sacred structures was quadrangular as in Mount Aventine in foro Olitorio or the herb Market in Mount Quirinal and elswhere amongst the Romans the ruines of her Temples do evidently witnesse as also her Temples anciently at Argos and amongst the Elians in Greece built of the like Form and of the Dorick Order But this Antiquity is of the severe Tuscane work and of a round figure The Temples to Pan had a Portico onely in front at Stoneheng it continues round about the Cell The Temples to Pan were not exposed to the open Aire and built uncovered as Stoneheng was but had roofs upon them For Ignis ei perpetuus ardebat therein they kept perpetuall fire as at Acacesium a Town also of Arcadians all Temples wherein they kept such fires being covered as the Temple to Apollo at Delphos amongst the Greeks and to Vesta at Rome amongst the Romans But if at any time they did erect them distant from a Town reserving always the Form and Order they chose such situations as wholly environed with trees for example the Temple to Pan in Mount Lyc us was compassed in with a thick wood condenso circumseptum luco as Pausanias hath it so likewise that Temple sacred to Him in the Parthenian Forrest according to the said Author Now this Temple Stoneheng is sited in an open champion Countrey where scarce a bush or tree much lesse thick woods or forrests to be seen throughout the whole Plain nor was there ever any in times of old as History remembers and the nature of the soil as I am informed is no wise prosperous for their growing there as is sufficiently before declared But Pan say they being the God of Shepherds why might not Stoneheng to gratifie them be erected and consequently by the Romans dedicated to their God Pan no place in the whole Island more abounding with sheep then the circumadjacent Plains the almost innumerable flocks whereof not only most plentifully satisfying the bordering inhabitants for food but from their delicate fleeces a great part of the known universe are clad also I answer amongst the Romans declared at large before to be Founders of Stoneheng I do not finde any one Temple Holy House Sanctuary Grove Altar or any such like sacred structure consecrated to Pan in their own Country much lesse any Temple dedicated unto Him by them in Britain and therefore utterly improbable this Temple Stoneheng should be erected by the Romans unto Pan Sidenote Dion Hal lib Sidenote Rosin lib cap Sidenote Justin lib Sidenote Plutarch in Rom Sidenote Rosin lib cap Sidenote Plut in Rom There was a Temple indeed built to Pan Lyc us on Mount Palatine by those Arcadians which accompanied Evander into Italy in which though the Romans in succeeding times performed the same rites as the Arcadians anciently had instituted yet He passed with the Romans under the name of Lupercus and in honour of Him as some Authors of opinion certain festivals or games called Lupercalia at Rome onely not in Provinces conquered by them were solemnized by the Romans Noblemens sons running in those games according to the primitive institution setting forth and beginning their course at Mount Palatine and so round about the City to the same place again I may not omit neverthelesse that severall Authors deliver the Lupercalia were instituted in thankfulnesse to Lupa or the wolf that gave Romulus suck and the course of those games beginning at Mount Palatine not so much in remembrance it seems of Pans Temple there as from the Lupercal or the very place they say where Romulus was cast out Sidenote Dion lib Dionysius of Halicarnassus tels us the Arcadians built the aforesaid Temple to Pan idoneo invento loco c when they had found out a convenient place for it adjoyning to their habitations the condition or nature of which place is not unworthy your observation for by his description thereof we shall easily perceive what manner of situation was by the Arcadian Shepherds held proper for performing the ceremonies of their God Pan His words are Erat tum ut fertur spelunca sub tumulo magna denso querceto contecta sub petris profundi fonticuli sol mque rupibus contiguum nemorosum frequentibus ac proceris opacum arboribus ibi ara deo extructa more patrio sacra fecerunt Under the Hill to wit Mount Palatine was anciently as report goes saith he a great cave or den covered over by a thick grove deep wells or riverets running amongst the stones of the cave and round about it a wood by the many and tall trees growing therein very dark and obscure there the Altar of the God was placed and his Sacrifices after their Country manner performed Now is Stoneheng thus sited or was there ever any such like place near this Antiquity of all the places in England that I know none comes nearer that cave then Ochy hole in Somersetshire And if the Ancients held such dismall situations only proper for Pans Temples then without peradventure Stoneheng was never erected in honour of him they being no innovators in their superstitions Sidenote Dion lib A further observation may be made to our purpose upon the aforesaid description Erat tum antrum magnum it was anciently saith Dionysius a great cave But in his own time which was under Augustus the Romans had so choked up the place with building that the manner how Pans Temple in old time stood was hardly to be discovered nunc quidem dificiis saith he fanum circumquaque sepientibus difficilis conjectura est qualis olim loci natura fuerit At this present verily the Temple being every way environed with buildings it is hardly to be conjectured in what manner of place it anciently stood This was the cause which enforced him to deliver to posterity the former description meerly upon report Certainly then the Romans employing the place to profaner uses Pans Deity was little esteemed by them otherwise they would never have polluted it by setting up private houses upon the place consecrated to him Now the Romans slighting him after this manner at home little reason appears so magnificent a structure as Stoneheng should be erected by them for adoration of Pan in other Countreys Sidenote Nat Com lib Furthermore the Sacrifices in times of old offered to Pan were milk and honey offered up in simple Shepherds crocks or earthen pitchers quare non rit sacrificabant qui tauros illi immolabant aut qui in aureis poculis lac aut vinum offerebant c Wherefore they sacrificed not aright saith Natalis Comes who immolated Buls or Oxen unto him or out of golden cups poured forth milk or wine upon his Altars for goblets of that metall were proper onely for the supernall and celestiall Deities not to terrestriall and such as had care of Heardsmen or Shepherd Swains To which purpose also the same Author out of Apollonius Smyrn us remembers Pan thus speaking of himself Sum Deus agrestis cur his sunt aurea sacris Pocula quo vinum funditis Italicum Ad petram cur stat taurus cervice ligatus Parcite non h c est victima grata mihi Pan montanus ego sum ligneus ips que vestis Pellicea est mustum fictilib sque bibo In English thus A rurall God am I in golden cup The Falern wine why then d yee offer up Why at mine Altar stands the stern Bull bound Or Oxe that s fat with laurell girland crown d Spare ye such cost no gratefull victimes these Are unto me others lesse costly please A Mountaineer a wood man clad in skin Am I your wine in earthen vessels bring But the Sacrifices anciently offered at Stoneheng already remembred were Buls or Oxen and severall sorts of beasts as appears by the heads of divers kinds of them not many years since there digged up Sidenote Platin in Bon Sidenote Dion lib As for that of the Pantheon it is very well known the Ancients so called it not in any relation to Pan but because it was sacred to Jove the Revenger and according to others to Cibele and all Gods For which reason Boniface the fourth obtained licence from the Emperour Phocas to consecrate it to the Virgin Mary and all Saints And who knows not the Architecture thereof wholly different from this of Stoneheng The Pantheon hath its Cell enclosed with a continued solid wall and the Portico only in front of the delicate Corinthian Order of which Order the inner part consisted likewise being vaulted in most admirable and magnificent manner From whence Dion Cassius delivers his opinion inde id nominis habere quod forma convexa fastigiatum c li similitudinem ostenderet it to be called the Pantheon because by the form of that vault wherewith covered it represented the concave of Heaven or as others will the figure of the world for the world being mans house the firmament is as the vaulted roof thereof At the crown of the vault it had an opening by which only it received light and air But this Antiquity Stoneheng built of a grave and humble Order as is said before had a double Portico continuing round about it the Cell thereof free and open and every way exposed to the air received light from all parts Wherefore leaving these Stoneheng was dedicated as I conceive to the God C lus by some Authors called C lum by others Uranus from whom the Ancients imagined all things took their beginning My reasons are First in respect of the situation thereof for it stands in a Plain remote from any Town or Village in a free and open air without any groves or woods about it Sidenote Vitr li cap Sidenote Godw Antiq l cap Secondly in regard of the Aspect for Stoneheng was never covered but built without a roof Which Decorum the Romans ever observed both in the Situation and Aspect of the Temples dedicated to this their God and to Jove the Lightner the Sun and the Moon Jovi fulguratori C lo Soli Lun dificia sub divo Hyp thr que constituuntur To Jove the Lightner and to C lus and to the Sun and to the Moon they erected buildings in the open air and uncovered saith Vitruvius in the second Chapter of his first Book Take with you also his reason Horum enim Deorum species effectus in aperto mundo atque lucenti pr sentes videmus because both the forms and effects of these Deities we behold present before our eyes in a clear and open view Another reason I find also why they built their Temples to C lus and those other Deities uncovered as Stoneheng because they counted it an hainous matter to see those Gods confined under a roof whose doing good consisted in being abroad Sidenote Pier Valer Hier lib Sidenote Leo Bapt Alb lib Sidenote Philand in lib Vitr cap Thirdly in regard of the Form of Stoneheng which is circular This figure was proper to the Temples of C lus and Tellus whom the Ancients called Vesta as Valerianus in his Hieroglyphicks affirms Non solamente la palla ma una simplice piegatura di ruota appresso gli Egizziani demostrava il Cielo Not only saith he the circular form but the meer segment of a circle amongst the Egyptians was an Hieroglyphick of C lus And to this purpose also Leo Baptista Albertus useth these words dem Vest quam esse terram putarent rotundam ad pil similitudinem faciebant Unto Vesta whom they reputed to be the Earth they built Temples of a round form globelike Besides observe what Philander commenting on Vitruvius tels us Templorum quanquam alia fiant quadrata alia multorum angulorum C li naturam imitati veteres imprimis rotundis sunt delectati Although saith he the Ancients made some Temples square some of six sides others of many angles they were especially delighted with making of them round as representing thereby the Form or Figure of C lum Heaven Sidenote An Pal li Sidenote Vitr lib cap Sidenote Apollod lib Fourthly in respect of the Order whereof Stoneheng built The severity of this Tuscane work retaining in it a shew as it were of that first face of Antiquity as A Palladio terms it being most agreeable to the nature of this their God reputed the ancientest of all their Deities and Father of Saturn For it was the custome of the Ancients as in part I remembred before to appropriate the severall Orders of Architecture according to the particular qualifications of those they deified Minerv Marti Herculi des Doric fient his enim diis propter virtutem sine deliciis dificia constitui decet To Minerva and Mars and Hercules Temples of the Dorick Order were made for to these Deities in respect of their valiant actions it was requisite to build without delicacy Veneri Flor Proserpin Fontium Nymphis Corinthio genere constitut aptas videbuntur habere proprietates qu d his diis propter teneritatem graciliora florida foli sque volutis ornata opera facta augere videbuntur justum decorem To Venus Flora Proserpina the Fountain Nymphs the Corinthian Order was thought most proper because unto these in regard of their tender natures the work seemed to advance a just decorum when made delicate and flourishing and adorned with leaves and volutes Junoni Dian Libero Patri c ter sque diis qui eadem sunt similitudine si des Ionic construerentur habita erat ratio mediocritatis quod ab severo more Doricorum teneritate Corinthiorum temperabitur earum institutio proprietatis To Juno Diana Bacchus and to the other Deities of the same quality building Temples of the Ionick Order they had regard unto the mean that from the severe manner of the Dorick and delicacy of the Corinthian the condition of their indowments might be duly moderated saith Vitruvius To Jupiter Sol and Luna though they made Temples sub divo open to the air and without roofs like this Antiquity yet were they not built of severe and humble but most delicate Orders and accordingly were adorned with costly ornaments and beautified with various enrichments in severall sorts of sculpture as by the ruines of them in divers parts of Italy remaining to this day evidently appears Respecting therefore this Decorum used by the Ancients in building their Temples and that this work Stoneheng is principally composed of a most grave Tuscane manner by just proportions of an agreeable form it is in mine opinion as I said before most agreeable to the quality and condition of that ancient C lus whom Antiquity reputed the very stem whence all those Deities in the succeeding Ages proceeded C lus ex eadem conjuge scilicet Tellure procreavit Oceanum C lum Hyperionem c novissimum omnium Saturnum suscepit C lus by the same wife to wit Tellus had Oceanus C lum Hyperion c and last of all begat Saturn To which purpose also Lactantius I finde Uranius by his wife Vesta had Saturn and Ops Saturn attaining the government called his father Uranius C lus and his mother Terra that by this change of names he might the more magnifie the splendor of his originall c Further I conceive it will not be impertinent to our purpose in hand to deliver what the Ancients have reported of C lus and wherefore they ascribed divine Honours unto Him Sidenote Boccace lib According to the Poets C lus was not that huge machine adorned with stars which Orpheus saith was composed for habitation of the Planets and other Deities and which we behold moving with continuall revolution but a certain man so called son to ther and Dies that is della virt ardente della luce famosa of transcendent influence and resplendent brightness as Boccace hath it Sidenote Diodor lib By Historians especially Diodorus Siculus it s thus delivered Scribunt prim m regnasse apud Atlantides C lum Homin sque antea per agros dispersos ad c tum condend sque urbes exhortatum fera eos agrest que vita ad mitiorem cultum extitisse c They write he which first reigned over the Atlantides was C lus and that he invited men living dispersedly before throughout the fields to convene and dwell in companies together exhorting them to build Towns and reducing them from wild and savage to the conversation of civill life Taught them also to sow corn and seeds and divers other things belonging to the common use of mankind Ruled likewise over a great part of the world from East to West Was a diligent observer of the stars and foretold men divers things to come The year before confus d bringing into Order according to the course of the Sun reducing it also into moneths after the Moons course and appointing likewise the severall seasons of the year Whereby many ignorant of the perpetuall course of the stars and amazed at his future predictions did verily believe he participated of Divine Nature and therefore after his death as well for benefits received from him as great knowledge of the stars they conferred on him immortall honours and adored him as a God And as appears called C lus in regard of his skill in the celestiall bodies as also for divers other causes eternall King of all the world Thus Diodorus It being an ordinary custome among the Heathens to deifie and esteem for Gods such excellent personages as either had well ruled or governed them or done any notable thing among them to their especiall benefit or good liking Such were they men or women remained with the name reputation and reverence of Gods or Goddesses after their deaths Sidenote Plut Phil opin lib Furthermore according to the Philosophers Men they knew not how by nature soon wanting and by instinct as soon seeking some God in stead of apprehending better deified the best to sense Whereupon out of all Entities as most glorious to the eye they first made choice of Heaven and Heavenly bodies considering again as the most beneficiall objects those living creatures and fruits which the Earth beneath brought forth to make compleat generations they coupled C lus to Tellus adoring Heaven as Father and Earth as Mother to these the pouring down of showers from Heaven seeming in stead of naturall seeds and the Earth as a Mother to conceive and bring forth the same Sidenote Rosin lib cap Fifthly the Sacrifices in times of old offered to C lus were Bulls or Oxen their great God Jupiter himself as I find in Rosinus offering such Victimes unto him Ante pugnam que cum Gigantibus in Creta habita est Jovem sacrificasse dicunt Soli C lo ac Terr bovem Before the battell struck with the Giants in Crete they say Jupiter sacrificed an Oxe to Sol C lus and Terra Now that there hath oftentimes been digged out of the ground at Stoneheng the heads of such beasts in all probability anciently in that place sacrificed I need not again remember being it is so well known Sidenote Pier Valer Hier lib Sixthly all the upright stones in this Antiquity are Pyramidall like flames in imitation of those theriall fires wherewith the Heaven is adorned Now that Fire hath the form of a Pyramis is evident percioche essendo largo da basso intorno alla materia esca da che si pasce finisce in acuta fiammache riguardo al Cielo Because being large at the bottome in respect of the matter and fewell by which it is fed it finishes in an acute flame tending upwards towards Heaven And that the Heavens are adorned with fires Natalis Comes in his Mythology out of Orpheus makes apparent Nihil aliud esse C lum existimans nisi hunc thera qui constat ex altissimis illis ignibus Supposing the Heaven to be no other thing but this Air which consisteth of those transcendent Fires Sidenote Vitr lib Sidenote Pier Valer Hier lib Lastly that Stoneheng was anciently dedicated to C lus I collect from the Conformation of the work For the conformation of the Cell and Porticus in the Plant was designed with four equilaterall Triangles inscribed in a Circle such as the Astrologers use in describing the twelve celestiall signs in musicall proportions According to that of Vitruvius In ea conformatione quatuor scribantur trigona paribus lateribus intervallis qu extremam lineam circinationis tangant In the conformation thereof let four triangles be inscribed of equall sides and intervals which may touch the extreme part of the circumference quibus etiam in duodecim signorum c lestium descriptione Astrologi ex musica convenientia astrorum ratiocinantur by which figures also Astrologers from the musicall harmony of the stars ground their reasonings as concerning the description of the twelve celestiall signs Besides the Cell it self in the formation thereof is cast into an Exagon one of the three figures likewise used by Astrologers in their aforesaid arguments of the sympathy of the stars Figuris tribus saith Philander utuntur Astrologi Trigono Tetragono Hexagono The Astrologers make use of three sorts of figures the Triangle Tetragon and Hexagon Furthermore the three entrances leading into the Temple from the Plain were comparted by an equilaterall triangle which was the figure whereby the Ancients expressed what appertained to Heaven and divine mysteries also Aggiungono i Magi saith Pierius Valerianus che un triangolo semplice di lati uguali indizio di divinit overo effigie di cose celesti The Magi adde that a triangle of equall sides is a symbole of Divinity or sign of celestiall matters Now this Antiquity consisting of severall stones orderly disposed into one entire work in imitation as it were of those severall stars which appearing to us in the Heavens in form of a circle are called the celestiall Crown and wholly designed by those Scheams wherewith Astrologers use to describe celestiall bodies which figures usually applied by them to particular accidents onely being all joyntly made use of by the Architect for conformation of this sacred structure it is not improbable Stoneheng was so composed because dedicated to C lum Yea further if lawfull to compare an idolatrous place with so divine a work was not the Temple at Hierusalem adorned with the figures of Cherubims that thereby the Nations of the Earth might know it was the habitation of the living God and why not in like manner this Temple composed by Astrologicall figures that after Ages might apprehend it was anciently consecrated to C lus or C lum Heaven Sidenote Dan Barba in lib Sidenote Vitr cap in Ven But in this conjuncture concerning such kinde of Temples as this at Stoneheng what saith the learned Patriarch of Aquileia Io credo che quel Tempio senza parete significava alcune cose del Cielo gli effetti delle quali sono nelle scoperto I beleeve that Temple without walls speaking of the Monopteros aforesaid had a relation to C lum Heaven because the effects thereof are openly displaied to the full view of all men Camden tels us he had heard that in the time of King Henry the eighth a table of metall was found not far from this Antiquity engraven with divers strange characters which being not legible was neglected and lost had indeed that Table been found within the work it self it might happily have brought to light somwhat in relation to Stoneheng And by all likelihood in time some inscriptions may therein be found it being the custome as well of Greeks as Romans in times of greatest Antiquity to lay inscriptions usually under the first stones set in what works soever especially those of any great magnificence Wherefore I advise mine honoured Friend Laurence Washington Esquire in whose demeasnes this Antiquity stands to whom I am much obliged for his friendly notice of what things have been there of late years digged up that he would be solicitous upon any search made there to enquire after them and if any found not to neglect or curiously conceal them but preserve and willingly produce the same I suppose I have now proved from Authentick Authors and the rules of Art Stoneheng anciently a Temple dedicated to C lus built by the Romans either in or not long after those times by all likelihood when the Roman Eagles spreading their commanding wings over this Island the more to civilize the Natives introduc d the Art of Building amongst them discovering their ambitious desire by stupendious and prodigious works to eternize the memory of their high minds to succeeding Ages For the magnificence of that stately Empire is at this day clearly visible in nothing more then in the ruines of their Temples Palaces Arch s Triumphals Aqu ducts Therm Theaters Amphitheaters Cirques and other secular and sacred structures Sidenote Camd fo History affords only Contemplation whereby their great Actions are made conceivable alone to reasoning but the ruines of their buildings Demonstration which obvious to sense are even yet as so many eye witnesses of their admir d atchievements Roma quanta fuit ipsa ruina docet How great Rome was her ruines yet declare Opinions fancied to the contrary I have rendred improbable the Authors of them in respect of this Antiquity being not only modern but also what said by them Romance like hatched out of their own brains even as other fables invented by them touching the Britains of old Men possest neverthelesse with a former conceit of things endure not by any means new opinions having not commonly patience to search long after the truth thereof To them ever the more generally received the truer things seem accounting all of their own time despicable insomuch as some are so far in love with vulgarly receiv d reports that it must be taken for truth whatsoever related by them though nor head nor tail nor foot nor footstep in it oftentimes of reason or common sense They that beleeve Geffrey Monmouths ipse dixit may make themselves merry therewith in pleasing their own fancy they displease not mine As I have delivered my own judgement freely all reason they should enjoy theirs But such as sail in the vast Ocean of time amongst the craggy rocks of Antiquity steering their course betwixt anciently approved customs and convincing arguments guided by good Authority and sound judgement arrive much safer and with better repute in the secure Haven of undoubted Truth For mine own part I had rather erre happily with venerable Antiquity then so much as trouble my thoughts with modern conceits Whether in this adventure I have wasted my Barque into the wished Port of Truths discovery concerning Stoneheng I leave to the judgement of skilfull Pilots I have endevoured at least to give life to the attempt trending perhaps to such a degree as either may invite others to undertake the Voyage anew or prosecute the same in more ample manner in which I wish them their desired successe and that with prosperous gales they may make a more full and certain discovery FINIS Errata Folio line These words The Romans overthrew not the Temples or razed to the Foundations any of the sacred structures of

You remember all the funny things Nibble heard about Man from the guests who came to his Storm Party That was the time the Big Hollow Oak blew down and the brave little bunny who lived at Doctor Muskrat s Pond rescued all the poor homeless folk who had been shaken out of it He showed them the way to a fine little tent all made of cornstalks out in the Broad Field It was so nice and snug and comfortable the minute they tucked their tails inside it and caught their breaths and sleeked down their fur and their feathers they forgot all about how the Terrible Storm was having a tantrum outside They had plenty of room to dance and plenty of corn for refreshments why the party was as big a success as if they d held it in a hired hall with engraved invitations But the most fun they had was talking about folks like you and me And if you d laid an ear to a crack before the wind tucked the snow blanket all around them you wouldn t have been very much flattered by what they said either You might have overheard the bats insisting that Man looked like a frog You might say that about some folks of course but certainly not about you or me You d prob ly have heard the partridge say that Man was brown and wrinkly like Grandpop Snapping Turtle The man they saw certainly must have worn some funny clothes Chatter Squirrel said Man was pink and tan His pink was sunburn the kind the fellows get down at the swimming hole Everyone just knew that everyone else was wrong Then Gimlet Woodpecker insisted Man came as many shapes and sizes and colours as the flowers And then they didn t know what to think There were just two things they all agreed on he didn t have a tail and he was dangerous Nibble didn t say anything cause he d never seen one But the first time he set eyes on Tommy Peele he made up his mind they were all wrong excepting about the tail The little boy looked to him like a red wing blackbird That was cause Tommy had on his new red mittens and his dark blue sweater and his shiny rubber boots But dangerous He certainly didn t look it Still when Silvertip the Fox only caught a glimpse of him he turned tail and ran So Nibble made up his mind to copy the mouse motto Say nothing and stay cautious At least that s what he thought he was too cautious for anything Wasn t it perfectly safe and proper to dig into that queer lair where the mice were holding a party of their own Wasn t it nice and dark as his own hole And nobody could possibly see him How was a bunny to know it was a soapbox Or that it was part of a figger four trap Or that Tommy had set it specially for him You see he hadn t been caught He d dug into it on purpose because those nice little mice had invited him And there the three of them were busy feasting when they heard the clump clump clump of the clumsy hind paws of that little boy Mice he said it s that Man Before he could twiddle a tail Tommy s red mitten was across the hole and Tommy s bare pink paw was closing on the lady mouse Then things began to fly Nibble was among them He flew to the next little cornstalk tent his heart thumping faster than his paws They were all of them right he gasped That Man is dangerous dangerous as Silvertip himself Poor Satin skin I s pose that s the end of her He never thought of saying Poor Tommy Peele But Tommy was the right one to feel sorry for Satin skin had closed her little needle teeth on his finger And before Nibble had taken a long breath he heard a voice squeaking Weeak weeak weeak which is mouse for I m lost Where are you Here he thumped with both hind feet And who should come scuttling in but Satin skin herself He could feel her tremble all over as she tried to squirm right under him My ears Nibble exclaimed I thought that Man had caught you No I caught him wept the little lady mouse But he shook me so hard I was scared to let go again And when I did he sent me tail over ears I tell you it was awful wee eeak Shh he ll hear you Nibble warned There your head will stop whirling pretty soon He knew just how she felt cause he d felt the same way himself the time he tumbled off the back of that Red Cow he took for a log when Silvertip was chasing him But Tommy wasn t even thinking about Satin skin let alone listening for her He stamped his tall rubber boots and sucked his poor nipped finger Funniest thing he wondered to himself I just know there was a rabbit in that trap I saw him go in there I don t guess it s very much good I ll try the pitcher wire Illustration Nibble squirmed and flounced like a fish on the end of a line So he pulled on his red mitten and tramped off to the path in the bushes by the fence he d seen Nibble slip through This time he bent down a springy sapling and tied a loop of wire to the tip of it the soft kind you use to hang pictures And he pegged the lower edge of the loop across Nibble s pathway CHAPTER II HOW NIBBLE THE BUNNY WAS CAUGHT Meanwhile Nibble was busy comforting the lady mouse There there Don t squeal any more You re not hurt a bit But really this gets more and more curiouser Now Silvertip would certainly have eaten you But I don t see yet why folks are so scared of a Man if that s all he can do to you You d know if he sh sh shook you sobbed the lady mouse But Nibble didn t pay any attention I m going to sneak up close to the Sparrows Tree and ask Chirp about it he announced Off went he so fast he didn t notice where he was putting his foot own He came to the fence and the picture wire Zing Now he knew what a trap was for sure and certain For the pegs let go the sapling snapped back and the wire caught him just behind his little fore legs and whipped him high up in the air He squirmed and flounced like a fish on the end of a line He kicked harder and harder and the wire pulled tighter and tighter until he screamed From way up there in the air he could see Tommy Peele turn around and hurry toward him swinging his red mittens as he ran And he knew Tommy had something to do with it This thought he is why Man is dangerous How awfully slow he flies Now he ll eat me And the wire was squeezing him so dreadful he didn t much care But Tommy just cut that terrible loop and took the rabbit gently into his arms Poor little bunny I didn t know that was going to hurt you whispered the little boy And he put a very sorry finger on the place where the picture wire had been But Nibble still kicked and struggled so hard that Tommy would have lost him if he hadn t kept a tight hold of the bunny s long ears And Tommy did keep a tight hold for the more he saw of Nibble the more he wanted him In ten minutes Nibble was locked in a cage It really was a very nice one for a rabbit who had been born there But for Nibble it was as cramped as Ouphe the Rat s narrow black tunnels under the haystack It was only half a leap long and three creeps across There was one dark corner in it where he could hide behind some hay when the humans came to look at him and they did come all sizes and colours and noises just as Gimlet the Woodpecker had said When they went away again he snubbed his nose trying to take the kinks out of his legs where he had been sitting on them And more than the humans came to call on him For the minute they turned their backs a great big beast much bigger than Silvertip put his forepaws up on the front of the cage and sniffed at him He was nearly the same colour as Silvertip only his back was more grizzled and he had a white collar as well as a white shirtfront like most wild things wear But this beast didn t have a hungry look he was only curious like Nibble is himself when he isn t scared All the same Nibble was afraid of him Just about sundown all these visitors went away This was the chance Chirp Sparrow was looking for He flew down and perched on the cage Then he cheeped very softly to make Nibble look at him Nibble pricked up an ear Then he jumped so hard that he hit the front of the cage and bounced back again but he picked himself up and thumped and wriggled his puffy tail trying to show Chirp how glad he was to see him Mr Chirp Mr Chirp he exclaimed You ll know how to help me You know everything Well not everything answered Chirp But he preened the feathers on his shoulders and cocked his head on one side the way birds do when they re pleased about anything For he was immensely flattered I don t know everything he repeated but I ll call a sparrow council and we ll see what can be done about it And something s pretty apt to happen when the sparrows put their minds to anything Now you listen to me he went on You eat what they feed you and keep strong You aren t in any danger right away And you try to make friends with that Dog What Dog asked Nibble He was puzzled He was here just a minute ago said Chirp That big foxy looking beast He s a great friend of ours He has a big dish by the back door that s always full of delicious things And he pretends to go to sleep while we pick up the crumbs You be just as polite as you can to him I ll be back in the morning And Chirp flitted off to the sparrow roost leaving Nibble almost cheerful again He couldn t help feeling that all this excitement was rather interesting CHAPTER III HOW NIBBLE TRICKED A FOE AND MADE A FRIEND Tommy Peele had tried to make his cage a comfortable one for Nibble to sleep in But he didn t know that a proper rabbit hole has fresh air blowing into it from above The cage had only one dark stuffy corner to hide in or the open part behind a wire front And there Nibble crouched in the hay Tommy had given him But he kept cheerful Chirp had said We ll see what can be done about it and Nibble knew the clever Sparrow So he just made a little song of the words until he sang himself to sleep with them Way long late toward the morning he woke up His furry feet were tickling So were his ears And presently his shoulders tickled too where the fur stood straight up on them Something was gnawing the floor of his cage Who s there he called softly And oh how he did pray it might be the field mouse who had shown him the way through Ouphe s tunnels He could see the haystack where the wicked Rat lived but it was so dark that that was all he could see It s I said the honey voice of Ouphe I ve come to show you what can be done about it I m sorry to be late but I had to attend to a little business with Chirp Sparrow The words were all right but the way he said them was enough to make your skin crawl What are you going to do demanded Nibble I m going to have breakfast with you said Ouphe I m going to make a nice little door so I can come in and we ll have a cozy time I love little rabbits I do And Nibble knew very well the way he loved them like Slink the Weasel For no wild beast needs to be warned against any one who has the horrid musky flesh eater s smell about him And Nibble smelled Ouphe I ll fasten my teeth right in your nose said Nibble the minute you poke it through my floor What good will that do sneered Ouphe You ll hurt me almost as much as Chirp Sparrow He pecked my ear he did the bold bad bird All the same I ate him You didn t sobbed Nibble He just couldn t believe it Didn t I just jeered Ouphe You can smell him on my whiskers when you bite me Sparrow for supper and rabbit for breakfast Mmn And he smacked his lips But Nibble almost forgot to be scared he was so angry He thumped his feet Stop that snarled Ouphe Do you want the Dog to eat you Thump Thump THUMP went Nibble He was bound to do whatever Ouphe didn t want him to Arrh cursed the bad Rat Kerflip kerflop he jumped down and shuffled off to his haystack Sure enough there came the Dog calling What s the matter here And Nibble was too scared to answer What s the matter here repeated the Dog He was standing in front of the cage wagging his long plumy tail But all Nibble could look at was the great teeth he showed when he smiled Please said Nibble very faintly please Mr Dog Ouphe the Rat ate Chirp Sparrow for supper to night I thought I ought to tell you because Chirp said you were friends He did did he laughed the Dog And he ran out his pink tongue which scared Nibble more than ever And who brought you the news Ouphe did He s been trying to get into my cage You don t say The Dog sniffed carefully Great Bones Bunny he exclaimed Why didn t you call me an hour ago I ll hate to show that to Tommy He ll think I wasn t watching Ouphe said you d eat me whispered Nibble Eat you repeated the Dog Lies All lies And Ouphe knew it I ll tell you Bunny don t believe a word that creature says He never tells the truth even by accident And he s always up to some devilment Somehow Nibble knew he could believe the things the Dog said in his rough but friendly voice All the same he wanted to be pretty careful Why wouldn t you want to eat me he asked Why because you belong to my Tommy I m not saying what I might do if you didn t answered the Dog wagging his tail harder than ever because he was so amused at Nibble Though I guess I m too old and fat to catch you But as long as you live in my Man s barns and have my Man s smell about you I ll never touch you My job is to take care of my Man s things and see that nobody hurts them Now it was queer but just the way that nice big growl Dog said he might possibly try to catch him if he wasn t Tommy Peele s rabbit made Nibble feel better He felt the Dog wasn t pretending like Ouphe the Rat did after he d been shouting horrid things at Chirp Sparrow He gave a little laugh a sniffly one because he wasn t quite over being afraid Please Mr Dog he murmured Chirp said I was to make friends with you Well then my name is Watch the Dog continued it s my job to watch this farm and see that things don t go wrong on it And that s why you should have called me the minute Ouphe put his ugly teeth into this He sniffed the gnawed spot on Nibble s cage Yes sir Nibble apologized Chirp didn t tell me that He just said you were once a wolf like Silvertip only much more clever Urr remarked Watch cocking an ear So Chirp s been going into my family history He s a gossipy bundle of feathers No insisted Nibble honestly Just about how the Wolves ate the Cows in the very First Off Beginning All right answered Watch Then I ll finish it for myself CHAPTER IV WHY DOGS LOVE BABIES You know how the wolves ate the cows in the First Off Beginning said Watch after he had taken a sniff to make sure Ouphe was still in the haystack It was because the Plants just wouldn t be eaten And they were too clever to starve He settled himself down by Nibble s cage Yes answered Nibble and how the good stupid Cows did starve so Mother Nature had to give them horns because they d worn all their teeth off Much good did that do them sniffed Watch Horns or no horns you just ought to see me handle them He was very proud of his work that nice dog Well he went on some of us were terribly ashamed over the way we d acted But Mother Nature wouldn t forgive us She said if we ever were trusted we d have to earn it ourselves She d never trust us Her good Beasts wouldn t have anything to do with us and we wouldn t have anything to do with the bad ones because we knew we weren t as bad as they were And we got lonely and unhappy so of course we got sulky and snappy too Then the bad Beasts took to calling us Dogs and that was a terrible insult in those days And deep down inside we were very very sorry because we did so want to be trusted One day a dog was walking all alone in the Forest and he saw the funniest little Creature playing there It was so funny he sat down on his tail to watch it play It hadn t any teeth to speak of and it hadn t any hair but it walked like a little cub bear Just like one It would stagger along a little ways and then it would sit down plump And then it would laugh So that made the dog prick up his ears He liked the sound it made when it laughed so much that he stayed there to listen to it And pretty soon it saw him But it didn t run away It just walked right up to him And the queerest feeling came over that dog He was happy deep down inside him Because it was trusting him So he sat very still And the little thing walked right up and felt of his teeth and tried to find out how he winked his eyes And the more it hurt him the better he loved it because then he was sure it was trusting him And it had the sweetest smell He put out his tongue and tickled it and of course it laughed again So he found out how to make it laugh whenever he wanted to And they played out there in the sun and were very happy By and by a Man came running up and behind him was a woman So of course that dog knew that he had been playing with their Baby And he got up and crept away because he knew that least of all they would have trusted him But the Baby cried and held out its hands for him All that night the dog was lonely because he d lost the little soft thing that laughed and trusted him And he told the Moon about it Dogs always tell things to the Moon And he was the most unhappy dog in the Forest because he d only learned half of the secret about being trusted Here Watch paused to rush at the haystack with a terrible bark because he thought Ouphe was sticking his nose out again Wurff he cleared his throat I ll catch that fellow some day he remarked as he came back to Nibble Rabbit s cage and sat down again Nibble was waiting for him with his little feet pressed close to the wires He wasn t afraid of any one while that dog was there to talk to him Go on please he demanded You said its Father and Mother took away the little soft cub who had trusted him And the poor dog felt lonely Cub I didn t say cub Bunny It was a Baby My but you are a green little wild thing He smiled again but this time Nibble wasn t afraid of the long teeth he showed You said it was like a little bear Nibble insisted and he wrinkled up his own nose Well Cub or Puppy or Baby the dog went on That first dog wanted it the worst way So he just trailed its people back to where they lived in a cave and he hid up on top of the cave where the gray smoke came creeping up through a crack And sometimes he d hear it laugh And nobody thought of looking there for him The dog would see the Man go out to hunt and the Woman go down for water and he could hear the Baby pattering around inside the cave And then it would sit down plump the way it did in the Forest And then it would laugh again And the dog s tongue would just itch to tickle the Baby So on the third day when the Man went out to hunt and the Woman went down for water he sneaked around to the cave door and first thing he knew he had his tickly tongue on the little soft thing And his ears were so full of the noises it made that he didn t hear its mother s bare feet when she came back And she threw the first thing that she had in her hand which was the water all over him Of course that didn t hurt him He didn t exactly like it any more than he liked the Baby s fingers when they pulled his whiskers but he never imagined she was fighting He thought she was playing with him So he trusted her which is the whole secret about being trusted And then wasn t he glad He just rolled around on the cave floor to dry himself though the cave floor was never very clean And he wriggled and giggled over it all And he gave the Baby a lick with his tickly tongue so it laughed with him But the Woman just stood there looking at him Now it s a queer thing Bunny but Humans can t stay angry if they laugh There was the dog all sprawly legs and waggly tail not looking like a wolf at all and the Baby laughing at him And the Woman began to laugh too You look so funny she said you ve got leaves in your whiskers And so they were friends CHAPTER V NIBBLE HAS HIS DOUBTS ABOUT DOGS That was a lovely story Nibble chuckled clear out to the tip of his tufty bunny tail He chuckled so hard he forgot he was locked up in an uncomfortable cage without a decent corner to snuggle in But you haven t told me yet how the First Dog made friends with his Man Go on Please do N no Watch answered thoughtfully scratching his shoulder I d rather not I m afraid you mightn t understand Yes I would teased Nibble Of course I would In the very First Off Beginning the dog made friends with the Baby and the Woman because he made them laugh Did he make the Man laugh too Why yes I expect he did Watch answered You see the Man wasn t friendly when he came home But the Woman and the Baby made him behave nicely They always do That is they wouldn t let him hit the dog with his stone hammer or jab him with his spear But he wouldn t look at him And the dog wanted that Man to trust him wanted it most of all So he began following the Man when he went out to hunt But the Man threw stones at him as soon as they got where the Woman couldn t see him do it and told him to keep out of the way The dog just crept off and hid He saw the Man creep up on a band of wild cows that were grazing and sleeping in the sun But just when he was almost close enough to kill one they all began to snort and run And they ran right past where the dog was hiding from the Man Of course he knew what that Man wanted So he just bounded out and pinned a cow by the throat and sent her head over heels And that did make the Man laugh My but he was happy So then he trusted the dog too and they were the best of friends for ever and ever And Watch smiled as though he were right proud of the memory But Nibble was horrified Oh he gasped The poor cow That was an awful thing to do After the dogs pretended to be sorry that they had done it when they were starving No wonder Mother Nature wouldn t trust them There said Watch I knew you wouldn t understand He didn t do it for himself He did it for his Man The Wild Things warned me said Nibble Both of them are bad Dog and Man Look here Bunny Watch explained patiently They don t either of them do that now They take care of the cows because now the cows belong to Man and have his smell about them Just the way I won t touch you because you re my Man s rabbit and have the smell of my Man I don t like to kill things except Ouphe the Rat and that s because he doesn t belong to my Man and my Man told me to Mother Nature wouldn t trust the dog so he won t obey her Man did trust him so he just everlastingly does obey his Man I d believe that better if the cows told it to me said Nibble defiantly All right I ll bring them up and let you talk to them as soon as they are milked and let out of the barn Watch was perfectly good natured about it I m going my rounds now but you just tell me if Ouphe troubles you again And off he trotted waving his plumy tail Nibble was terribly shocked So any dog would do anything his Man told him to do no matter what Mother Nature thought about it Now just what did the cows think of that Nibble wanted dreadfully to know because he hadn t the least chance in the world of asking Mother Nature or any of the wise Wild Things How he did want good old Doctor Muskrat It was getting lighter and lighter less and less scary every minute Everything would be much more cheerful when the Sun peeked out over his shoulder from down South where he was busy with the other half of the Earth Suddenly a voice shouted from somewhere right behind him All Evil Spirits hark and hear The warning call of Chanticleer Er er er er errh It was just the Rooster calling himself by a high toned name the way he always does But Nibble had never seen one He was so s prised he jumped and snubbed his nose against the cage So he huddled up in the middle of it again Then all the voices of the farm yard began calling Good morning Good morning and he thought of course they were calling to the Sun But pretty soon the pigs began their scary grunts and then one squealed Good morning We want our breakfast Right off all the rest of them took it up The horses whinnied and the cows mooed and the sheep bleated and the ducks and chickens and guinea fowls and turkeys all shouted we want our breakfasts Suddenly a new voice cheeped right beside him I want my breakfast too It was Chirp Sparrow Oh dear I do wish they d stop said Nibble Whoever are they calling It isn t the Sun Course not It s their Man and Tommy Peele I can hear them coming Then Nibble remembered something Why Chirp he said in surprise Ouphe the Rat said he had eaten you And he tried to eat me too Ouphe is a liar said Chirp decidedly I hope he hears me say it I wish that dog could catch him He never will Nibble answered sadly Silvertip could but not that dog He shouts every time and lets Ouphe know he s coming And when he does watch at one of Ouphe s holes he keeps beating the haystack with his tail That s a tattle tail for sure Worse than the Mouse s I ll tell you what Chirp cocked his head on one side and looked thoughtful We ll all have to put in and help the dog catch Ouphe If we don t there ll be a young dog on this farm and he s sure to be a foolish one But how can I help while I m in this cage You ll be out before long said Chirp cheerfully And so he was though even Chirp didn t know how it was going to happen And just then Tommy Peele came running up with some toothsome carrots and a whole armful of clover hay for Nibble s breakfast though he hadn t asked for it CHAPTER VI THE CLEVERNESS OF CHIRP SPARROW Watch must have kept his word about sending the cows to talk to Nibble Rabbit For the first thing they did when the barn door was opened was to come trooping up to his cage And an old White Cow put her big starey eye right up close to it because she s very near sighted and sniffed Nibble s fur blew as hard as it did the time of the terrible storm But her breath was all warm and sweet with clover so he wasn t afraid though she was three times as big as the dog The very first thing the White Cow said was Why don t you eat your breakfast I can t I m all cramped up in this cage answered Nibble Illustration The White Cow makes friends with Nibble He s too much afraid of being eaten laughed Chirp Sparrow and he perched right on the White Cow s horn Why there s no one going to hurt him drawled the Cow in a surprised tone There was Ouphe the Rat last night Nibble felt pretty trembly about him Ouphe The disgusting thing He came in and messed up our feed and danced over us with his pricky feet so we couldn t sleep I just called Watch mooed the White Cow in her nice fluty voice It reminded Nibble of the South Wind Aren t you afraid of Watch Nibble asked for now he was truly going to find out whether Watch was bad He said he d kill you if his Man told him to Watch Why Watch couldn t kill any one He s too fat and sleepy and good natured And no man would ever tell him to Aren t you afraid of Man Nibble asked next Man The White Cow snorted again and most of the others snorted too Why Tommy Peele s all the man that ever milks me And he s only a little boy He snuggles right in beside me as though he were my own Calf I love Tommy Peele I don t like Tommy Peele bellowed the Red Cow Nibble had taken for a log when Silvertip chased him I don t like Tommy Peele He threw stones at me when he drove me out of the cornfield She nudged the White Cow away and sniffed at Nibble s carrot I d like that said the greedy thing You d quarrel with any one drawled the White Cow You re always doing something you ve no business to do And she moved off Then Chirp Sparrow had a fine idea Look here he whispered in the Red Cow s ear If you want to get even with Tommy Peele you just catch your horn in that wire and let out his rabbit Um m I dunno mumbled the Red Cow She didn t like stones the way Tommy could throw them Then you can have the carrots all the carrots There are lots of them under the hay lied Chirp The Red Cow lurched her head awkwardly Her horn caught on the wire Then she got scared and tried to break loose again But what she broke loose was the whole door She bounced off with it dangling against her face Moo oo oo she bawled as she plunged about the barnyard Take it off Take it off It hurts my no o se But Nibble didn t care He took a fine long jump that stretched his long legs And then who ever said a rabbit couldn t dance He danced a proper hornpipe and he twiddled his puffy tail and flopped his ears all at once because it felt so good to be free And Chirp Sparrow squawked and sat down on his tail feathers because he was laughing too hard to fly Half at Nibble and half at the Red Cow Of course all the other sparrows came cheeping and chirping and Chanticleer the Rooster crowed though he didn t know what he was crowing about And the noise brought Watch the Dog on the run and after him came Tommy Peele not nearly so fast for he still had his tall rubber boots on And Nibble took to the only hole he knew anything about which was Ouphe s but he was so startled he didn t stop to think of that And the bad old rat woke up and started to come out of that very hole to see what all this noise was about Then wasn t Nibble in a nice fix Just wasn t he In front of him Watch was sniffing and digging at the hay Behind him Ouphe was murmuring in his sticky trickly voice Come right in little Friend Rabbit Come right in Just then Watch barked to Tommy Peele Here he is I ve got him And Tommy said in a very severe voice Go way Watch Don t you hurt my bunny There barked Watch he says you re still his bunny even if you are wild again Come along But Nibble didn t move Go away said Tommy again Go on Watch he ll never come out until you do But Watch didn t move He could hear Ouphe saying in a horrid voice Come in here or I ll take you by the tail and pull you in And he held his very breath and his wagger with it Of course Ouphe thought he had gone away And he wasn t very scared of Tommy Peele So he caught hold of Nibble s tail And then Nibble was so frightened he began to squeal and pull And Ouphe held back Come along Nibble come quick pleaded Chirp Sparrow He meant that the dog was safer than the rat But Ouphe thought he meant that the dog was gone So he let Nibble pull him to the very edge of the hole Aurgh sang Watch very joyfully indeed For he never touched Nibble at all but nipped Ouphe the Rat right through the heart with those very long teeth he shows when he laughs Nibble sat right down there in the sunlight until he got his breath and nobody tried to catch him Watch couldn t He had his mouth all full of Ouphe And he was walking around on the tips of his toes looking so vain that all the sparrows laughed at him Even Tommy Peele joined in But Watch didn t care a bit He just smiled as wide as he could let his mouth go and not lose Ouphe out of it And Nibble slipped over and ate his carrot How good it tasted now he was free CHAPTER VII HOW A BUNNY COULD HELP A BOY Now don t you forget that it was the greedy Red Cow who let Nibble out of his cage She wanted his carrot so much that she pulled the wire door right off with her horn And then she got scared and careered way down the Snowy Pasture with that door banging against her nose getting madder and madder and madder Well she finally scratched it off on to a prickly thorn bush that held up its arms to help her And then she came back to the barnyard as fast as she could run For she d lost her temper entirely And you know what happens when things do that It happened to the Storm and to Mrs Hooter and to Silvertip the Fox and to Chatter Squirrel and Slyfoot the Mink and Nature only knows how many more It s always something unpleasant Illustration Just then Watch barked to Tommy Peele Here he is I ve got him But she hadn t forgotten that carrot because she was so terribly greedy She galloped up and sclooped her tongue around beneath the pile of hay in Nibble s cage No there weren t any more carrots at all So she rolled her eyes around and saw Nibble just finishing up the sweet inside of it Moo oo oo she roared And it didn t sound a bit like the White Cow s fluty voice Moo She tried to catch Nibble on her sharp horns or trample him with her big hard toes But he was too quick He just made two jumps and ran under the haystack Then she shook her horns at Chirp Sparrow who was perched on a fence post You lied she roared You said there were lots of carrots here But Chirp just squawked rudely and flew into a tree and she only banged her sore nose on the fence wire So the next one she took after was Tommy Peele who hadn t done anything to her at all And you remember Tommy had on his tall rubber boots so he couldn t run very fast Not fast enough to run away from the Red Cow And suddenly Nibble found he was dreadfully afraid of what might happen to Tommy Peele Besides it was all his own fault excepting that Chirp really oughtn t to have lied to her So he bounced out under her very nose calling I took the carrot I took the carrot But the Red Cow wanted someone she could catch and hurt because she had lost her temper She wanted Tommy Peele Only she never got him Because right then things did begin to happen Watch dropped that rat and clamped his teeth right on her sore nose There he growled in his throat I ll teach you to hurt my little boy I ll hurt you bawled the Red Cow trying to stamp in his ribs with her big horny feet You will It was the White Cow s voice but it wasn t fluty now She was galloping tail up and head down Whang she hit the Red Cow s ribs Blam she hit her so hard in the shoulder that Watch lost his hold And the Red Cow was all through hurting any one She turned and ran limping and licking her sore nose Maybe you think Nibble Rabbit wasn t puzzled when he saw the Red Cow run bawling down the pasture with a limp that would keep her feeding in circles for a week He had thought of course she was going to fight with Watch the Dog and instead she had turned on Tommy Peele Now that was wrong so Watch had a perfect right to stop her But when the White Cow came charging up Nibble never in the world expected to see her help Watch give the Bed Cow a terrible trouncing And here was Watch all smiles and waggly tail saying Much obliged I m sure Mother Snowflake I was finding that heifer quite a mouthful And the White Cow was answering Oh I ve been waiting quite a while to drive a bit of sense into the wild little thing And she settled down to switching her tail and chewing her cud as calmly as ever But that made Nibble indignant She s not a Wild Thing he said Wild Things have better manners than any of you or they d be fighting all the time I m a Wild Thing myself so I know Oh it s the Bunny drawled the White Cow dragging her words the way she drags her toes because she thinks as slowly as she walks Well I didn t mean to hurt your feelings You re perfectly right Manners are to keep folks from fighting to make them think before they pick a quarrel That Red Cow just wouldn t think until we made her Now she ll learn Nother thing Nibble insisted we don t help any one against our own kind That sort of talk is less use than a trampled cornstalk Mother Snowflake lowed sensibly All the kind we have here is Tommy Peele His people take care of us so we take care of him Yes Watch put in you saw how he trusted us And he waved his tail quite grandly But he didn t say Thank you Nibble looked about him in surprise for Tommy had disappeared He doesn t keep it in his pocket but he won t forget it promised the Cow And she wet her nostrils with her slaty tongue to sniff what it was going to be He doesn t talk our talk Watch explained but he does know the sign language of tails pretty well I told you she mooed triumphantly For there came Tommy with his cap full of meal He poured a big pile before her and a little one close to Nibble But he gave Watch a great big hug That little thank you is for you smiled Watch over Tommy Peele s shoulder Why Bunny do you think we didn t see you trying to help us with the Red Cow Nibble certainly had tried his best for deep down inside him he began to know why the tame beasts all loved Tommy Still he hesitated I won t come back to my cage he warned I m wild you know That s all right Watch promised but wild or tame you re Tommy Peele s and some day you ll be glad to know it So go ahead and accept that thank you like a sensible beast or you ll be hurting Tommy s feelings Nibble really wanted to My but it smelled good And the White Cow was heaving big sighs of happiness over her pile But he didn t want to be caught again so he was very very careful Lip it lip it he tiptoed over and sniffed Then he just couldn t resist it It WAS good Quite as good as it smelled Pretty soon he felt like sighing too because his little skin was tight And Tommy Peele never tried to catch him at all Because now he knew what it felt like to be chased He only took off his red mitten and twiddled his pinky fingers Nibble knew that those fingers were nice and gentle when they petted him and that was all Tommy wanted to do But he just couldn t quite dare to let him So he cleaned the last crumb off his whiskers with the little fur brushes he wears on his paws and said That was mighty nice but I m a Wild Thing still and I m going back to the woods where I belong Good bye Mr Watch Good bye Mother Snowflake for that s what Watch had called the White Cow Good bye barked Watch You ll find us here any time you want us Mother Snowflake couldn t stop to talk She was too busy So Nibble signalled a very polite Good bye to Tommy Peele with his little tufty tail though it was still rather stiff where Ouphe the Rat had bitten it But Tommy didn t understand Nibble not yet He only knew the talk of the tame beasts So he felt quite sad when he saw the Bunny go skipping lipity lipity down the long lane CHAPTER VIII HOW THE FUNNY BUNNY SMELLED A JOKE Lipity lipity lipity Nibble Rabbit hopped down the long lane from Tommy Peele s red barn He was in a dreadful hurry to get home to the Woods and Fields Out in the Snowy Pasture the wind blew cold The Red Cow stood with her back to it looking very sad and thoughtful but she spoke to Nibble politely for she d found her temper again Pretty soon he was passing the cornstalk tents in the Broad Field but one of them smelled so foxy that he didn t wait there for Silvertip to come back Now he was in the Clover Patch He stole past the oak that blew down in the Terrible Storm and around the Brush Pile Then he went straight for his own old hole How he had dreamed of it when Tommy had him in that cage No one had been there since the Terrible Storm for the doorway was drifted shut So in he popped And then he almost popped right out again for there was someone in it Yes someone was in his very own home and he couldn t tell who But it was someone with a nice clovery breath like White Cow s so Nibble thought he couldn t be dangerous Here he called Whoever you are wake up This hole is mine But Someone never answered He felt Someone s warm fur listened to Someone s breathing He touched Someone s fat side with his paw Then he tried to shake Someone by the scruff of his neck but Someone was much too big for him And Someone wouldn t wake Nibble cocked his head on one side and thought about it Then he tried a few experiments At last he said Very well There s plenty of room for both of us in here I don t know but we ll both be more comfortable But you just remember when you do wake up that this hole is really mine Someone just slept on But Nibble didn t care for he made a perfectly lovely foot warmer The next morning Nibble brushed the sleep out of his eyes with his furry paws and nudged Someone Come along he urged We ll hunt some breakfast For it was the dark of the moon when rabbits feed at early dawn and dusk They prefer moonlight at other times I ll get him out he thought and have a look at him Someone only made a little sucking noise as though he were eating something perfectly delicious in his dream and went on sleeping You re a funny beast said Nibble right out loud I m going to ask Doctor Muskrat about you Someone slept right on So off Nibble set for the pond among the cattails And all the breakfast he found along the way was some coarse grass very dry and wind whipped and the dry brown seed heads of yarrow And that wasn t much after the wonderful breakfast Tommy had given him Everything was all changed The cattails were drifted waist deep in snow and the pond was all ice so he could walk right up to Doctor Muskrat s house in the middle of it He thumped No answer He thumped again and then he danced as hard as he could on top of it He was having a very busy time all by himself when he heard Doctor Muskrat s gruff voice calling Who s that What do you think you re trying to do anyway Nibble flashed about and saw the doctor s tousled head poking from a hole among the cattails Good morning he said politely I was just looking for your front door Well you ll find it here over this warm spring the one spot in the pond that doesn t freeze shut so I always have a place to come for a breath of fresh air The old doctor was puffing as he made his way through the crusty hillocks between the bulrush stems Duck me but it s Nibble Dear dear What did you want You aren t ill And he was all ready to dive back after one of his famous roots No indeed but you know everything Nibble began confidently Won t you please tell me who s asleep in my home hole and won t wake up And he told all about it Hm Doctor Muskrat wriggled his nose thoughtfully much as any nice old gentleman will when his spectacles are pulled too far down on it It sounds to me it most certainly sounds to me like that fat old bluffer Snoof Woodchuck Nibble s ears pricked Does he bite he asked anxiously Oh no Doctor Muskrat reassured him He s a harmless old crank and a strict vegetarian though the garter snakes say he s a snappish fellow before he completely wakes up in the spring Who wouldn t be with their perpetual whispering and squirming He lets it out that he s a kind of hermit and sits meditating in his hole with his eye on the weather but I ve always suspected he was snoozing On the day after the first February moon casts her shadow he pretends to come out and deliver his opinion Though I never knew any one who really saw him Even People know the story They call it Groundhog Day And Groundhog is just a rude nickname for the woodchuck Though how any one but the woodsfolk came to hear about it is a mystery I ll bet you a sassafras root went on the doctor contemptuously that lazy old skeezicks never wakes up a day before Tad Coon But if everybody thinks he does Nibble objected there must be something behind it There is Doctor Muskrat agreed There s a lot of talk and he s the one who starts it too It would make you sick to hear him straddling around after the frost is out of the ground saying I told you so I told you it would be bad weather or good weather whichever it has happened to be But I never saw any one who had heard him say it Illustration The old doctor was puffing as he made his way through the bulrush stems Well Nibble insisted why doesn t someone keep watch and tell on him Doctor Muskrat shook his head If you didn t keep watch so that everyone would know they d go right on believing him And if you did that and he did wake up the joke would be on you And that s never any fun Well that certainly kept Nibble quiet for a little while He was thinking Pretty soon his nose began to wrinkle and his eyes hid like little pinpoints deep in his fur He was trying so hard not to laugh Doctor Muskrat said he how soon is that February moon Doctor Muskrat waddled up the bank and took a nip of willow stem Grubs and clam shells he exclaimed in surprise Sap s stirring Why it s only the hatching of an egg away That s two weeks as the woodsfolk count time Nibble he added curiously I believe you re smelling something I am Nibble chuckled I m smelling a wonderful joke Half of it will be on that old snoozer in my hole and the other half will be who ll the other half be on There aren t many folks out answered the doctor telling them off on his paw There s Chewee the Chickadee Chaik the Jay and Gimlet the Woodpecker you couldn t possibly fool him and the fieldmice The fieldmice They do nothing but tattle and gossip and they ll believe anything And Nibble was delighted Well the other half of this joke will be on the fieldmice Doctor Muskrat did you ever hear that the fur of a woodchuck woven into a mouse s nest is a sure charm against an owl s catching them But it s got to be plucked the day after the first February moon Doctor Muskrat thought a minute and then he laughed He laughed so hard he slapped his tail on the ice because he saw what Nibble Rabbit was thinking about CHAPTER IX THE GREAT WOODCHUCK FUR CHARM AGAINST OWLS Nibble Rabbit and Doctor Muskrat sat among the bulrushes on the Frozen Pond and laughed and chuckled over the joke they were planning on the old woodchuck in Nibble s hole He had everybody believing that he came out of his hole on the day we call Groundhog Day though the woodsfolk never use a rude nickname like that even for a woodchuck and predicted the weather That is everybody believed it except Nibble Rabbit and Doctor Muskrat This was their plan They would get every fieldmouse in the woods and fields looking for the woodchuck on that particular day Then if he did wake up the joke would be on the fieldmice And if he didn t well you just listen Nibble hopped all about from the Frozen Pond to the little cornstalk tents in the Broad Field looking for field mice And every time he found one he d say What s this story that s going around I hear that woodchuck fur plucked the day after the first February moon is a sure charm against owls Just the littlest tuft woven into a nest will keep the young mice from being caught Is there any truth in it The mouse wouldn t let on that any one knew more about mouse secrets than he did so he d say Oh that used to be an old mouse custom but of late years it s been hard to find a woodchuck And then he d scuttle off to the holes and tunnels where the mice live and fuss and gossip and chatter about it Then they all ended up at the great hollow stump where Great grandfather Mouse has lived for so very many years that his ears are all crinkled and set that agog And poor old Great grandfather Mouse got so bewildered that he dragged himself down to the Frozen Pond to talk with Doctor Muskrat Which was exactly what Doctor Muskrat had been hoping for The Doctor was very polite and pleased to see him Certainly he said I ve heard the story Fact is I might have heard it from you yourself when we were both very young But dear dear my memory isn t very good any more Only I m perfectly sure it was the day after the first February moon He didn t want any mistake about that Yes yes agreed Great grandfather Mouse I remember I remember it all now you call it to mind But where could I find a woodchuck Well seeing we re such old friends whispered Doctor Muskrat I ll let you know But it s a secret He s down in Nibble Rabbit s hole I expect that sly young bunny means to be married in the spring and won t his hole be nicely lined with woodchuck fur just won t it Great grass seeds exploded Great grandfather Mouse It s a mouse charm No rabbit has anything to do with it So he stumped off home dragging his fat old tail and wagging his crinkled ears and in half an hour more people knew about Doctor Muskrat s secret than if Chatter Squirrel had shouted it from the treetops They knew where the woodchuck was and they meant to get some fur off him too And Nibble Rabbit was all but turning somersaults on his little paddy feet out behind the bulrushes because he was so amused over it The great day came at last Groundhog Day the day when the woodchuck ought to come out to foretell the weather for spring And Nibble Rabbit and Doctor Muskrat weren t the only ones who were watching for him For all the snow around the mouth of Nibble s hole was tunnelled by the mice and they were scuffling and squeaking beneath it so it s a wonderful thing Silvertip the Fox didn t hear them And Nibble thought what a wonderful joke it would be if that woodchuck did come walking out of the hole So he shook him and jounced him and pulled his round mousy ears and his long spiky whiskers But no That woodchuck just wouldn t wake up So finally Nibble gave it up and crawled out of doors And there at the mouth of the hole he met old Great grandfather Fieldmouse who was too fat and clumsy for any tunnel Good morning said Nibble I see you ve come to greet my friend Mr Woodchuck when he comes out to foretell the weather I don t know what you re talking about said Great grandfather Fieldmouse very severely This is the day we come for our regular charm of woodchuck fur to keep our young safe from owls He spoke as solemnly as though he had done it every year of his life It s strictly a mouse charm he went on and no rabbit is going to keep us from it He said that because Doctor Muskrat had given him the idea that Nibble meant to keep it all for himself And Doctor Muskrat gave him that idea because he didn t want Great grandfather Mouse to suspect that Nibble had invented the whole story about the charm Doctor Muskrat knew they d never bother about coming after the woodchuck fur unless they thought that someone else wanted it as much as they did Very well Nibble answered meekly but please leave a little for me We ll see if there s enough to go round replied the mouse And with that he laid back his ears he s so old that they re all crinkled and marched down into Nibble s own hole And out he came with a mouthful of fur And every fieldmouse from all the woods and fields solemnly marched in and did the very same thing as if they d done it every year of their lives too And maybe you think Nibble Rabbit and Doctor Muskrat didn t laugh until their sides were fit to split maybe you think they didn t Because they knew they were going to be able to prove to every one of the woodsfolk just where Mr Woodchuck was and what he was doing on the next day after the first February moon After the last mouse had left his hole Nibble went in to see what they had done He came out again in a hurry Whew he said to Doctor Muskrat I ll have to sleep in the Pickery Things to night It s all mousy in there But they ve plucked that sleepy old woodchuck as bare as an egg And Doctor Muskrat chuckled Just you wait until he wakes up in the spring That wasn t till a long way after St Patrick s Day when the little gray pussies hung on all the willows And he took three whole days to wake up in For the first day he just grunted and groaned and made the noise that the woodsfolk take his name from Snoof snoof he d go as though he were trying to sneeze but was too lazy to do it And the minute he did that Nibble hurried down to Doctor Muskrat in the marsh and told him about it Very good said Doctor Muskrat Tell me how he behaves to morrow On the second day Snoof Woodchuck had turned over in the hole with his feet in the air and was acting as a dog does when he has a dream Nibble told Doctor Muskrat Very well said the Doctor He ll stand on them to morrow and we ll all be there to greet him Then he waddled off to the hollow stump where Great grandfather Fieldmouse lives And Great grandfather Fieldmouse poked his head out Well well he demanded in his crotchety voice because he s very old so old that his ears are all crinkled What do you want now I just wanted to let you know that to morrow morning Snoof Woodchuck will take the air an hour after sun up said Doctor Muskrat very politely Well what s that got to do with me demanded Great grandfather Fieldmouse I let you know because we re such old friends said Doctor Muskrat Surely you remember that as long as the mice kept up the good old custom of gathering to thank the woodchuck the woodchuck stayed here and you always had your charm I suppose so I suppose so grunted Great grandfather Fieldmouse So on the third day when Snoof Woodchuck climbed out into the air all the fieldmice were assembled He was very much complimented He bowed pompously this way and that and oh how funny he looked as though the moths had been at him Hmm hmm he began importantly As I told you when I predicted the weather on the next day after the first February moon But he never got any further For the mice simply squealed in surprise Why that was the day we came for our charms of woodchuck fur You were fast asleep You old bluffer jeered Doctor Muskrat we caught you napping this time Look at yourself squealed Nibble Rabbit standing on his tallest toes to hop about See if you re not mouse eaten You re as naked as you were born yah I m ashamed to look at you And the mice all echoed him And that woodchuck scuttled back into the very bottom of the hole and hid there until midnight And then he went so far away that no one ever saw him again or even heard of him CHAPTER X WHAT DOCTOR MUSKRAT THOUGHT ABOUT TRAPS Quite a long while ago I promised to tell what Tommy Peele was doing in the Broad Field when he let Nibble Rabbit s storm party out of the little cornstalk tent Well to begin with he was looking for the tracks of the woodsfolk But as long as the snow lay deep on the ground he didn t find many For Doctor Muskrat and the fieldmice and Nibble Rabbit were about the only ones who stayed there Doctor Muskrat was too clever to leave tracks where any one would see them And the fieldmice had their tunnels far below the crust so you never saw anything of them And you d have to creep around among the Pickery Things before you d see many signs of Nibble Rabbit But the birds called very often to get a drink from the warm spring hidden among the bulrushes that was Doctor Muskrat s front door It was Chewee the Chickadee who brought news of the quail They have to go a long way in the deep woods every day to find enough seeds for so large a flock he said And they told me that I must leave every last weed head that pricked up above the snow in their thicket for Nibble Rabbit Now that was very nice of the quail because there were very few seeds left and Nibble was eating the dried grasses that the Pickery Things kept from him and the delicate bark from the sunny side of the willows Illustration Snoof Woodchuck comes out of his hole Chaik the Jay perked his crest thoughtfully It must be horrid to live in big flocks like that where you can never find a full crop for everyone at once The partridge are perching in some evergreens They say it s safer than sleeping in the snow where they might be frozen in again Only they can t find anything to eat but birch and poplar buds and they re awfully hungry But not so hungry as Hooter the Owl and his wife I wonder why they flew away right in the middle of the terrible storm Silvertip the Fox left then too said Gimlet the Woodpecker who had been working in the orchard back of Tommy Peele s barn There must be something in that There is said Nibble I was the game Mrs Hooter chased into the cornstalk tent but Silvertip was the one who came out of it He mussed their feathers and they tweaked his ears and now they re afraid to meet each other Chaik laughed The owls are still quarrelling he told Nibble Well Silvertip has learned to get into the chicken coop Gimlet reported and Chirp Sparrow says that s climbing into a peck of trouble Who cares Nibble rejoiced Now that Slyfoot s gone to find a better hunting ground we have no one to look out for But Doctor Muskrat spoke up very thoughtfully Yes Nibble Sooner or later we ll have to look out for Man Shucks sniffed Nibble carelessly flopping his ears No Man ever comes here unless it s Tommy Peele And he s such a little one who s afraid of him I am And Doctor Muskrat stroked his whiskers with his paw You can t judge the size of his jaw by the size of his trail nor know how far he ll reach out to bite you But Nibble merely twiddled his tail to show how little he cared for a whole flock of Tommy Peeles While Tommy had him in a cage up by the barn Tommy had been good to him And none of the tame beasts were afraid of Tommy Peele He hasn t any teeth to speak of Nibble protested and he hasn t any claws He couldn t hurt any one I ve been right in his very paws so I know Yes you have agreed Doctor Muskrat And how did you get there Didn t he reach out and catch you when he was the whole length of the pasture away And this time Nibble didn t feel like twiddling his tail It was perfectly true He knew that somehow Tommy had been the one who made that dreadful wire snatch him into the air And he hadn t quite forgotten how it all but squeezed the life right out of him when he swung there It hadn t felt in the least like the soft touch of Tommy s hand So he asked with a little shiver What are those jaws like Doctor Muskrat They re harder than bone and colder than stone They never miss and they never let go said the wise old Muskrat very earnestly And that s the truth about a muskrat trap It s just a pair of steel jaws harder than bone and colder than stone exactly as he said And they re worked by a terrible spring They never miss because the spring won t snap unless a beast steps right between them And they won t let go again until the Man opens the spring again No beast can ever learn that Because no beast has ever imagined that they weren t a part of the Man And a Man can have a whole pack of those jaws the old doctor went on They ll hide out in the leaves where you can t see or hear them sometimes you just sniff the faintest chilly smell on them They re worse than a whole pack of Silvertips because you can see and hear and SMELL him How awful breathed Nibble It isn t fair Well Mother Nature wasn t fair to Man in the First Off Beginning argued the wise old beast The cows complained and got their horns and so did a lot of others but Man wouldn t complain It s a law that when a beast invents anything for himself he has a right to use it So you can t blame Man for using anything Well said Nibble thankfully I m glad Tommy Peele doesn t use those jaws But up behind the barn Tommy Peele had his first pair of the awful things He wouldn t have dreamed of using them on the chickens or Watch the Dog or even on Nibble Rabbit because they were friends of his But he didn t think any more of using them on a muskrat that he didn t know than the muskrat would have thought of using his sharp teeth on Tommy Peele And he wanted the muskrat s skin Which was perfectly natural because every man has had to use some other creature s fur since the First Off Beginning of things until he got to be friends with them CHAPTER XI THE SINGULAR MISHAP OF DOCTOR MUSKRAT Don t you ever believe that a small boy who grows up in the open air like Tommy Peele doesn t know just as much about the ways of the wild things as any of the wild things know about the ways of men Only he doesn t know he knows it Because he doesn t have to hunt for every meal as he used to in the First Off Beginning And the only way you find out what you really do know deep down inside you is to use it All the same the very day Tommy Peele got out his trap was the day the muskrats began their spring running He hadn t seen their footprints even yet but that something deep down inside him told him it was time to expect them That trap wasn t a very good one He got it from Louis Thomson who had a lot that he set out all through other people s woods where he thought the other people wouldn t catch him because he wasn t quite satisfied to hunt just on his own And he knew this particular trap was slow because it was all rusty and it hadn t a good spring But he made Tommy give him a two bladed knife and his big glass shooter and twenty cents to boot For the Red Cow wasn t the only one who was greedy But Tommy oiled it and cleaned it and got it to work And he specially showed it to Watch the Dog and told him to be very careful not to sniff around and get his nose in it And Watch spread himself out beside Tommy while Tommy worked Watch snoozed contentedly in the sun and flopped his tail whenever Tommy talked to him For the weather was beginning to grow warmer The thaw that the poor partridge had wanted so badly had come Down by the pond the ice was getting so soft that Nibble didn t dare thump on it to call Doctor Muskrat And he wanted to call him a great deal of the time For he knew the wise old doctor was very careful about making tracks near his warm spring But all sorts of careless young muskrats were wandering up and down the stream They said it was mating time and they were trying to find some lady muskrat who would be foolish enough to start housekeeping then They ran in and out among the willows gnawing and digging and making the plainest sort of trail and then they would flop with their muddy feet right into the drinking hole I can tell you it made Nibble angry enough He didn t fancy drinking after them but they didn t pay any attention to him And Chaik the Jay got into such a rage that he forgot he should have kept quiet there He perched on the tallest bulrush and cursed and squalled at them But when Doctor Muskrat heard the rumpus and lifted his head up through the ice with his long teeth showing between his gray whiskers they scuttled off as though Silvertip himself were after them And then the old doctor would fume The Mink take them and their love making the silly young things What s the sense of disturbing the whole marsh just because they want everyone to know they re old enough to dig a nursery Eh He forgot that he d done the very same thing in his own first spring But Nibble thought they were having a mighty good time over it all Only he wished they wouldn t leave quite so many tracks for Tommy Peele to find And the very next day there came Tommy splashing through the big puddles in his tall rubber boots sloshing through the last of the snowdrifts and whistling a lively tune And Nibble pricked up his ears to listen Because he thought that maybe Tommy was on a spring wandering of his own and this was his mating song For he never dreamed that whole generations of bunnies and muskrats and piping birds would grow old and die before Tommy even thought of such a thing Tommy had on his blue sweater but he d left his red mittens hanging back of the stove because he d got them all wet snowballing And Watch was dancing along in front of him singing Aourgh aorugh which is neither a mating song nor a proper hunting song It was like Tommy s whistle it showed that he was perfectly happy But Nibble wasn t He was awfully uncomfortable For all the footprints of those foolish young beasts led straight to the warm spring which was still the only open water though the ice was soft and melting all over the pond And you remember this was the wise old doctor s front door Of course Tommy followed them right there And Nibble crouched into a clump of bulrushes close behind him close enough to hear him working over something close enough to hear Watch saying in an excited tone It s all right I can smell em lots of em Nibble was so worried he nearly squirmed He wanted to get out to the little round house in the middle of the pond and warn Doctor Muskrat The minute Tommy s back was turned he started to creep over the crumbly ice toward it But Watch s back wasn t turned He bounced out after Nibble And he bounced right through the ice And the minute Doctor Muskrat heard that splashing and thrashing right in his front pond out he popped Clang That ugly trap had him by the paw Oh h h Oow w w screamed the poor old doctor But he didn t lose his head entirely Quick Nibble he begged bite off my toes before that dog gets here I can t reach them His own poor old teeth were chattering with fear and pain And that s exactly what Nibble was trying to do when Watch floundered out of the water Aourgh I ve got you he barked joyfully Then he stopped short and wagged his tail in the friendliest way Why you re Tommy s rabbit he said And he tried to explain to Tommy Peele But Tommy wouldn t listen He couldn t think of anything but that poor old beast squealing over his hurt paw It made Tommy s own throat hurt to hear him He wanted to help but the doctor couldn t understand He just gnashed his teeth and snapped at Tommy Then Tommy managed to touch the spring of the trap with his toe He stepped and it yawned open just for an instant Away went Doctor Muskrat But Nibble wasn t looking He had leaped back into his hiding place in the reeds and closed his eyes He wished he could close his long ears as well He expected to hear his good old friend squeal when Tommy killed him But all he heard was a splash Then Watch the Dog said I told you you d be glad you were Tommy Peele s rabbit He was standing close beside Nibble and he was looking over his shoulder to give an affectionate wag of his tail toward Tommy Peele Nibble looked too And there was Tommy unfastening his trap from where he had tied it to a reed clump so it couldn t be dragged away But there was no sign of any muskrat He s gone Watch explained Tommy let him go I expect that was because he was a friend of yours Of course there was still too much wolf in Watch for him to understand that Tommy had just been sorry for hunting the doctor But Watch was sure anything that small boy did was wonderful and reflected forever to his credit But why did he bite him if he didn t mean to eat him Nibble asked in a trembly voice That was something he never did understand And Watch didn t try to He was cocking his ears to see what next Tommy was going to do Tommy yanked the trap loose from the reed clump And he wasn t proud of owning it any more He hated it quite as much as Nibble or even Doctor Muskrat did He swung it about his head and threw it splash into the hole Watch had made when he fell through the ice chasing Nibble Then he looked at a hole the doctor s long teeth had slashed in his tall rubber boot I don t care he said defiantly I don t care a bit I hurt him awfully He had a perfect right to hurt me if he wanted to The teeth hadn t gone in deep enough really to bite Tommy s toe but of course neither Nibble nor Doctor Muskrat ever guessed that Their hides belong to them and they couldn t ever imagine that his tall rubber boots weren t any more a part of Tommy than those steel jaws of his traps were Watch could because he sometimes wore a collar and on very cold nights Tommy covered him up with a blanket but he never thought of explaining it Illustration Clang That ugly trap had Dr Muskrat by the paw Then Tommy marched all the way up to the house and got his cap full of the same delicious meal he had given Nibble and the White Cow the day the Red Cow chased him It was Thank you to them for helping him get away from her He set out two little piles Then he called Here Bunny Bunny Bunny And that showed Nibble that one of those piles was for him So Watch was right It was nice to be Tommy s rabbit And Watch explained The other is for your friend the Muskrat Don t you eat it As though Nibble would CHAPTER XII TOMMY PEELE S FRIENDS STAND UP FOR HIM Of course Nibble Rabbit wouldn t eat the pile of meal Tommy Peele left for Doctor Muskrat But he thought he was going to have a terrible time to keep all those foolish young muskrats who were scuttling round in the marsh trying to start their spring love affairs from doing it He forgot that everything around the place where Tommy had set it still smelled of the little boy and his dog So not another beast dared come near it Chaik the Jay and Chewee the Chickadee stole a few beakfuls but Nibble knew Doctor Muskrat wouldn t mind that And he wanted company So he told them all about how Tommy had caught the doctor and let him go again And how Tommy had thrown away the trap Chaik raised and lowered his crest just as we sometimes do our eyebrows when we re puzzled about anything He was lucky Chaik said I ve seen beasts suffer in a trap for whole days before they died And I never heard of any before that got out of one alive I believe that human is queer Sometimes I think he s trying to think the way we woods folk do I know it chimed in Chewee When it was so terribly cold I was having an awful time The ice had frozen over the cones so I couldn t even pick a living among the pine trees And do you know what he did He tied a big lump of fat pork away out on the end of a springy branch so that fat house cat couldn t reach it Just for me Wasn t that clever And he began hopping about in the excited way he has whenever he gets to talking Well he most certainly is trying to make friends with us Nibble observed Only catching us in traps isn t a very comfortable way of doing it You fellows will have to help me convince Doctor Muskrat Help He needed it It was two whole days before the doctor poked his head out of the hole where Watch had smashed the crumbly ice The wise old beast wasn t using his front door any more Come on called Nibble cheerfully See what Tommy Peele left you to say he was sorry he bit you Not I growled the doctor I ve had enough of his jaws He spread out his paddle paw The good roots he stores in his medicine chest had nearly healed it but his little toe was gone I m going to move away as soon as I can travel Don t do that pleaded Nibble If he bit your foot you certainly bit his Now he doesn t mean ever to use those jaws again He threw them into that very hole Pop Down went the doctor to have a look And his face was mighty surprised when it popped up again It s the truth he said Those jaws are biting the mud We needn t worry so long as we can keep an eye on them Nibble I ll just dip a whisker into that present Tommy Peele left for me And he liked the meal quite as well as Nibble had better in fact I tell you what Nibble he said as he stopped for breath this was mighty thoughtful of that Man Now I wonder if he knew that I couldn t dig or swim with my paw hurting me because his paw was hurting him I hope not And that was very nice of him because it was all Tommy s fault in the beginning Tommy had deliberately set that trap Chaik the Jay swallowed such a big beakful of meal that he had to crane his neck over it then he blinked very seriously because Nibble was giggling at him Do you s pose we could all trust Tommy the way Nibble can if we all were friends with him he demanded Of course of course chirped the enthusiastic Chickadee Hm sniffed old Doctor Muskrat a bit gruffly that sounds very well from you birds You have wings so you can fly away from him Certainly Chaik retorted but I ve never seen him swim Hmm hmm the doctor snorted again And he hitched himself on his three sound legs over to a big stone that had grown warm in the sun and spread himself out flat like a small furry rug He meant to think it over But he felt so comfortable and full that he fell into a snooze Nibble was snoozing too snuggled up beside him but he awoke when he heard Tommy s tall rubber boots splattering through the slush His father had put a patch on the hole when he was mending an automobile tire so it was as good as ever Nibble nudged the doctor and then hurried over to greet Tommy jumping the splashiest puddles and pattering right through the little ones because he didn t want his friend to think Chaik and Chewee were the only ones who d take the trouble And Tommy took an ear of corn out of his pocket and shared it between them Then Tommy ordered Watch to stay back while he tried to speak to Doctor Muskrat And the old doctor didn t flash right into the water as he really meant to He sat up holding his poor paw in front of him and squinted his eyes to get a good look at the little boy He didn t even jump when Tommy laid down the other ear of corn nor when Watch came sneaking disobediently up behind him because he wanted to poke his nose into what was going on For Tommy caught him by the fur and pointed that inquisitive nose straight at the doctor There he ordered take a good smell so you ll know him again That s my muskrat And Nibble was so pleased he took a leap and kicked his furry heels so high that Tommy laughed at him You re safe You re safe he rejoiced Isn t it almost worth being caught for Illustration Tommy s tall rubber boots spattered through the slush And Doctor Muskrat considered his sore paw and then he considered the little boy And he looked very thoughtful CHAPTER XIII WISE WORDS FROM A WISE BEAST Neither Nibble Rabbit nor Chaik Jay nor Chewee the Chickadee nor all of them together could make Doctor Muskrat say what he thought of Tommy Peele No he insisted I haven t made up my mind It s a safe rule for any beast to do as his kind have done before him and I never knew any muskrats who made friends with a man Nor any man who wanted to be friends with a muskrat either pleaded Nibble Tommy Peele s different That s the way with men said the doctor They re always changing Only the wild things stay the same What is Man anyway Nibble asked He isn t a bird and he isn t a fish and of course he isn t a snake But the bats who came to my storm party in the cornstalk tent said he couldn t be a beast because he hadn t any tail Nonsense snorted the doctor Tad Coon s cousin the bear hasn t any more tail than that What did the bats think he was A kind of a frog said Nibble promptly But Chatter Squirrel didn t agree with them A frog A frog Had those bats ever seen a man then Or a frog either Eh And the doctor made such a face of disdain that his whiskers bristled up like a lot of long darning needles on Granny s fat pin cushion Why a frog is less than a beast and a man well there used to be a tale going around when I wasn t much bigger than Chewee there that Man was kin to Mother Nature herself in the very First Off Beginning The old muskrat sank his head back between his shoulders and half closed his eyes Go on said Nibble breathlessly Eh What The doctor came back with a start as though the shadow of an owl had passed near him I was just thinking about that winter There was a big family of us the year I was born for food was very plentiful So were minks And when my mother thought she heard one sniffing close by she d tell us stories to keep us quiet Otherwise we wriggled around in that dark old house like a lot of tadpoles popping in and out of the water until you could almost swim on the very floor it was so wet from our dripping And when we got to romping we d squeal more than a whole stump full of fieldmice Nibble couldn t imagine the dignified portly old fellow scuttling and squeaking A rabbit hole is always very quiet Because it s on the ground and so many hunters might hear it if it weren t I just remember finished the doctor that one of our favourite tales was about how Man quarrelled with Mother Nature in the First Off Beginning She was used to the wild things And most of them excepting the ones who came up from under the earth are very obedient But Man just wouldn t obey her And she wouldn t stand that because it would be unfair to the rest of us and because he was kin to her So she said he could try getting along without her help and see how he liked that And he certainly surprised her He But that s as far as the wise old fellow ever got For right then there came a most startling interruption And so many brand new happenings began that I ll have to write a whole brand new book to tell about them all THE END END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NIBBLE RABBIT MAKES MORE FRIENDS This file should be named txt or zip This and all associated files of various formats will be found in https

CHARLES ASHLEIGH BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL A Mystery Rime for Little Children of All Ages The rain comes down and veils the hills Ah tender rain for aching fields The hills are clothed in a mist of rain My heart is clothed in a mist of pain Ah mother rain that laves the field If I to you my poor soul yield Will you not cleanse it soothe it tend it Weep upon it til tis mended Twas sweet to sow tis hard to reap Come mother rain and lull me to sleep Lull me to sleep and wash me away Out of the realm of Night and Day Back to the bourne from whence I came Seeming alike yet not the same Rain you are more than rain to me And Lash of Pain may be a Key Ope then the door and tread within The double Door of Good and Sin Is vanquished Lo with bread and wine The table s spread The feast is Mine LOVE IN THE ABYSS Amidst the buzz of bawdy tales And the laughter of drinking men I sat and laughed and shouted also Yet was I not content My seared and restless eyes turning here and there Like my tired soul Seeking new joys and finding them not How oft swept you unseeing Until suddenly And now I know not how I could have missed it My eyes saw into yours And plumbed the deep wells of newly born desire Ah dear my heart what things your eyes did speak Not God s own music of creation s dawn Revealed to mystic in a holy trance Could pleasure me more sweetly So dear were your lips Your lips so kind and regal red My memory of your lips I cherish As a great possession Ah flying joy Caught on the wings of Time Tender oasis Ingemmed in a wilderness of grey Kisses kisses Kisses upon your red lips in the black night When alone in the long quiet street By the door of the tavern Shielded from sight of those within The soft rain falling on our heads like a mother s blessing We bartered the clinging kisses of new desire And as I held you to me The whole universe Became informed of God And lay within my arms JEALOUSY You are possessed by another How I hate him Hear the rational people say Jealousy is a primitive thing A thing of the emotions not of reason Fools You do not know scarlet desire full flooded Ah my dearest Graal of my heart s longing Your stolen kiss is fresh upon my neck My lips are full of my secret kiss upon your neck You are with another whom I hate whom I like well for himself but hate because he possesses you Your possessor is old and ugly He can not love you as I can I can pour out for you the scented treasures of my young love Dear night of hope when you gave me the whispered promise to come to me Stealthy was I and cunning Friendly and attentive was I to your old lover if lover he may be called who is almost incapable of love And all the time I was scheming for you When the old man was away for an instant Oh golden moment I poured my whispered passion into your ears When he looked away or for a moment was distracted with swift undertones I declared myself to you How dear was your welcoming glance and your quickly toned assent You had a face so proud So quiet and poised among the throng Yet for once you gave me your eyes and in so doing gave me your priceless body and warm comradely soul Ah flash of answering love that transformed your face As a jewel of my memory s treasure casket may it be preserved When the drinking place was closed we walked along the dark street Do you remember We were four luckily and the old man was kept busy in conversation half drunken as he was And we with our secret between us walked behind Our hands were tight clasped in the folds of our dress Tight clasped with the clinging hand caress you and I trying to put into our hands all the longing that was in us All the time we were apprehensive of a sudden turning of the old man or the other Then the whispered troth and the meeting place appointed And then later boldly so openly and audaciously it brought no suspicion Under seeming of wine induced jollity we kissed And they laughed it seemed a trivial jest to them But to us it was a sacrament But best of all my beloved was the hurried clasping and kissing when we were alone in the dark Promise of joy to come Foretaste of the coming ecstasy And then we had to part I and my unaware friend You and the old man As I walked home that night How I hated him How I looked up at the pale golden moon high hung in the purple sky and sang in my heart your praise and cursed in my heart your possessor But we will out wit him Young I am and young are you and the Law of Life bids us mate And a whole world standing between us would be melted and destroyed by the fire of our youth s desire THE GLORIOUS ADVENTURE OF GLORIOUS ME I swim with the tide of life towards the new I reach out hungered arms to flowing change I smash the awesome totems of my kind My smarting vision bursts its cramping range A thousand voices yell within my soul A thousand hymns are chanting in my heart I blast the mist of worlds and years apart I sense the blending glory of the whole The sap of flowers and trees it mounts in me I feel the child within me cry and turn The crimson thoughts within me writhe and burn I stand with craving arms high flung before the rimless sea And every whirling passionate star sings melodies to Me And every bud and every leaf has sought my private ear And to the quickening soul of Me has told its mystery As I sit in state in the heart of the world As I proudly hug the core of the world As I make me a boat of the whole wide world And then for new worlds steer THE RENAISSANCE OF PARENTHOOD MARGARET C ANDERSON There seems to be a kind of renaissance of motherhood in the air Ellen Key has just done a book with that title which has come to us too late to be reviewed adequately in this issue Mrs Gasquoine Hartley has written The Age of Mother Power which will be brought out in the fall and in Shaw s new volume of plays Misalliance Fanny s First Play and The Dark Lady of the Sonnets there is a preface of over a hundred pages devoted to a discussion of parents and children which says some of the most refreshing and important things about that relationship I have ever read The home as such is rapidly losing its old functions perhaps it is more accurate to say that it is changing its standards of functioning and that the present distress merely heralds in a wonderful new conception of family potentiality But a generalization of this sort can be disputed by any family egotist so let s get down to particulars It s all right for the enlightened of the older generation to preach violently that the family is a humbug as Shaw does that the child should have all the rights of any other human being and that there is nothing so futile or so stupid as to try to control your children It s not only all right it s glorious But what I m more interested in still being of the age that must classify as daughter is this what are the children themselves doing about it Have their rebellions been anything more than complaints have they made any real stand for liberty have they proved themselves worthy of the Shavian championship Well I got hold recently of a human document which answered these questions quite in the affirmative It was a rather startling thing because while it offered nothing new on the theory side of the matter it showed the theory in thoughtful action which for all the talk on the subject is still rare It was a letter of some twenty pages written by a girl to her mother at the time of a domestic climax when all the bonds of family affection family idealism and obligation were tending to smother the human truth of the situation as the girl put it She was in her early twenties she had a sister two or three years younger and both of them had reached at least a sort of economic independence She had come to the conclusion after a good many years of rebellion that the whole fabric of their family life was wrong and since it was impossible to talk the thing out sensibly because as in all families where the children grow up without being given the necessary revaluations real talk is no more possible than it is between uncongenial strangers she had decided to discuss it in a letter That medium does away with the patronage of the parents refusal to listen seriously that Oh come now what do you know about these things If the child has anything interesting to say if he puts any of his rebellion into his writing the chances are that the parent will read the letter through and the result is that he ll know more about his child than he has learned in all the years they ve been trying to talk with each other and not succeeding I m enthusiastic about this kind of family correspondence it s good training in expression and it clears the air jolts the heads of the family into realizing that the thinking and planning are not all on one side I once did it myself to my father put ten pages of closely written argument on his office desk so that he d open it with the same impersonality given to a business communication in which I explained why I wanted to go away from home and learn to work and why I thought such a course was an intelligent one The letter accomplished what no amount of talking would have done because in our talk we rarely got beyond the Oh now you re just a little excited it will look different in the morning stage Father said it was rather a shock to him because he didn t know I had ever figured things out to that extent but we always understood each other better after that However not to get lost in personalities this is the letter the girl showed me and which she allows me to quote from partially If we are to continue living together in any sort of happiness and growth the entire basis of our present life will have to be changed We can do it if we re brave enough to do what people usually do only in books face the fact squarely that our family life is and has been a failure and set about to remedy it It will mean an entire change of home conditions and these are the terms of the new arrangement When I said to you the other day that things would have to go my way now you were horrified at the conceit of it To get to facts there s no conceit in it because my way is simply the practise of not imposing one s will upon other people I made the remark merely as a common sense suggestion and made it out of a seriousness that is desperate I say desperate because I mean that literally the situation isn t a question of a mere temporary adjustment just some sort of superficial arrangement so that we can get on pleasantly for a while before the next outbreak comes The plans Betty and I have discussed have been made in the interest of our whole future lives whether we re going to submit either by surrender or compromise or by just drifting along and not doing anything to an existence of bickering nagging hours spent in the discussion of non essentials hideous lack of harmony the whole stupid programme we ve watched working for years and achieving nothing but unhappiness folly and a terrible human waste You ask us to continue in your way but from at least three points of view that way has been a failure I ask you to adopt my way which has not yet failed That s why I say it s not conceit but common sense My way is simply this that we three can live together and work in peace and harmony if this awful bugbear of Authority is dropped out of the scheme Each of us must go her own way we re all different and there s no reason why one should impose her authority on the lives of the others You say that you should because you re our mother But that s the thing I want to discuss Motherhood isn t infallibility If a woman is a wise woman she s a wise mother if she s a foolish woman she s a foolish mother Because you re our mother doesn t mean that you must always be right before being a mother you re a human being and any human being is likely to be wrong To get down to brutal facts we think you are not right about the whole thing We ve thought so for years but now it s come to the time when our thinking must be put into action We re no longer children but even as mere infants we thought these things without having the right to express them What I m trying to do now is to express them not as a daughter but quite impersonally as a human being as a mere friend a sister or anyone who might come to you stating that she believed with all her soul that you were wrong and also stating just as impersonally that she wouldn t think of modeling her line of conduct after that pattern which appeared to her so wrong We must face the facts if you do that squarely it doesn t seem so bad and you stop flinching about it You get to the point where you re not afraid to face them boldly and then you begin to construct And this is the only way to clear up the kind of rottenness and decay that flourishes in our family life It s in the interest of this achievement that I say the thing a girl isn t supposed to say to her mother namely that Betty and I will not any longer subscribe to the things you expect us to The fact to face just as quickly as possible is this it s the starting point When you realize that we feel it s a question of doing this or laying a foundation for lives that are just half lives hideous perverted things which miss all the beauty that you can put into the short life given you I think you ll see how serious we are We re at least two intelligent human beings if we re nothing else And why should you ask or expect that we ll submit to a system which to us means stupidity misery pettiness all those things which we ve seen working out for years and which being at least intelligent we want to keep away from That much settled we can continue to live together in just one way as three sisters or friends the motherhood in so far as it means authority or an attempt to mould us to your way must be eliminated A complete new family idealism can be built on such a basis You will say that it s an abnormal basis for any mother to accept Of course it is but the situation is abnormal and the orthodox remedies aren t applicable The reason I say the situation is abnormal is this usually when a mother objects to her daughters behavior it is on some definite basis of opposing the things they do like going to too many parties or falling in love with the wrong man You have very little fault to find with the things we do Your objections are on a basis of what we are or rather of what we are not that we are not orthodox that we are not hypocrites that we are not the kind of daughters the Victorians approved of Hypocrites will sound paradoxical but you have confessed that you would rather have us lie to you than to disagree with you that you would rather have us be sentimental about the way a girl should treat her mother than to learn how we ought to treat ourselves You call that being respectful and think that harmony is possible only under such conditions We call it being insulting and think that it s the one sure way of destroying any chance of harmony If we respect you it must be because we think you worthy of the truth anything else is degrading to both sides You ll say you can t be satisfied to live with us and not give advice and all the other things that are part of a mother s duty You may give all the advice you want to the keynote of the new situation will be that we ll take the advice if we believe it s right if not we ll ignore it just as a man ignores his friend s advice when he feels it to be wrong Of course the wise person doesn t give much advice he simply lives his life the best way he knows how That s the only bid he can make for emulation If we tell you that we don t approve of the creed you have made you mustn t be surprised if we try to formulate one of our own There s no reason for us to ask you to change just because we re your daughters You must do as you believe But you must grant us the same privilege We disagree about fundamentals If our beliefs were merely the vague unformed ideas of children you might try to change them But it s too late now So we can live together harmoniously only if we give up the foolish attempts at influencing We re not living three generations ago We ve had Shaw since then and parents and children aren t doing the insulting things to each other they used to do Among intelligent people some of the old issues can never raise their heads again And so it s for you to decide whether we shall build on the new foundation together or separately It might be a play it s certainly rather good for reality And what happened The mother refused to accept the terms which is not surprising perhaps and the household broke up into two establishments with results that will disappoint the conservative who thinks those girls should have been soundly beaten The first wrench of it the girl said reminded her of George s parting with Marion in Tono Bungay that sense of belonging to each other immensely that profound persuasion of irreparable error in the midst of what seemed profoundly right Nothing is simple Wells wrote in that connection every wrong done has a certain justice in it and every good deed has dregs of evil But the girl and her mother have learned to be friends as a result of that break and the latter will tell you now that it was the right thing to have done The preface to Misalliance has such a wealth of quotable things in it that the only way to get them appreciated is to quote Shaw has said much of this before but it is all so valuable that it ought to be shouted from the housetops The people against whom children are wholly unprotected are those who devote themselves to the very mischievous and cruel sort of abortion which is called bringing up a child in the way it should go Now nobody knows the way a child should go What is a child An experiment A fresh attempt to produce the just man made perfect that is to make humanity divine And you will vitiate the experiment if you make the slightest attempt to abort it into some fancy figure of your own for example your notion of a good man or a womanly woman If you treat it as a little wild beast to be tamed or as a pet to be played with or even as a means to save you trouble and to make money for you and these are our commonest ways it may fight its way through in spite of you and save its soul alive for all its instincts will resist you and possibly be strengthened in the resistance but if you begin with its own holiest aspirations and suborn them for your own purposes then there is hardly any limit to the mischief you may do Francis Place tells us that his father always struck his children when he found one within his reach Francis records the habit with bitterness having reason to thank his stars that his father respected the inside of his head whilst cuffing the outside of it and this made it easy for Francis to do yeoman s service to his country as that rare and admirable thing a Free thinker the only sort of thinker I may remark whose thoughts and consequently whose religious convictions command any respect Now Mr Place senior would be described by many as a bad father and I do not contend that he was a conspicuously good one But as compared with the conventionally good father who deliberately imposes himself on his son as god who takes advantage of childish credulity and parent worship to persuade his son that what he approves of is right and what he disapproves of is wrong who imposes a corresponding conduct on the child by a system of prohibitions and penalties rewards and eulogies for which he claims divine sanction compared to this sort of abortionist and monster maker I say Place appears almost as a Providence A gentleman once wrote to me and said with an obvious conviction that he was being most reasonable and high minded that the only thing he beat his children for was failure in perfect obedience and perfect truthfulness On these attributes he said he must insist As one of them is not a virtue at all and the other is the attribute of a god one can imagine what the lives of this gentleman s children would have been if it had been possible for him to live down to his monstrous and foolish pretensions The cruelty of beating a child must be whitewashed by a moral excuse and a pretense of reluctance It must be for the child s good The assailant must say This hurts me more than it hurts you There must be hypocrisy as well as cruelty The most excusable parents are those who try to correct their own faults in their offspring The parent who says to his child I am one of the successes of the Almighty therefore imitate me in every particular or I will have the skin off your back a quite common attitude is a much more absurd figure than the man who with a pipe in his mouth thrashes his boy for smoking If you must hold yourself up to your children as an object lesson which is not at all necessary hold yourself up as a warning and not as an example But you had much better let the child s character alone If you once allow yourself to regard a child as so much material for you to manufacture into any shape that happens to suit your fancy you are defeating the experiment of the Life Force You are assuming that the child does not know its own business and that you do In this you are sure to be wrong The child feels the drive of the Life Force often called the Will of God and you cannot feel it for him Most children can be and many are hopelessly warped and wasted by parents who are ignorant and silly enough to suppose that they know what a human being ought to be and who stick at nothing in their determination to force their children into their moulds Experienced parents when children s rights are preached to them very naturally ask whether children are to be allowed to do what they like The best reply is to ask whether adults are to be allowed to do what they like The two cases are the same The adult who is nasty is not allowed to do what he likes neither can the child who likes to be nasty There is no difference in principle between the rights of a child and those of an adult the difference in their cases is one of circumstance Most working folk today either send their children to day schools or turn them out of doors This solves the problem for the parents It does not solve it for the children any more than the tethering of a goat in the field or the chasing of an unlicensed dog in the streets solves it for the goat or the dog but it shows that in no class are people willing to endure the society of their children and consequently it is an error to believe that the family provides children with edifying adult society or that the family is a social unit The family is in that as in so many other respects a humbug Old people and young people cannot walk at the same pace without distress and final loss of health to one of the parties And since our system is nevertheless to pack them all into the same house and pretend that they are happy and that this particular sort of happiness is the foundation of virtue it is found that in discussing family life we never speak of actual adults or actual children or of realities of any sort but always of ideals such as The Home a Mother s Influence a Father s Care Filial Piety Duty Affection Family Life etc etc which are no doubt very comforting phrases but which beg the question of what a home and a mother s influence and a father s care and so forth really come to Women who cannot bear to be separated from their pet dogs send their children to boarding school cheerfully They may say and even believe that in allowing their children to leave home they are sacrificing themselves for their children s good But to allege that children are better continually away from home is to give up the whole popular sentimental theory of the family If you compel an adult and a child to live in one another s company either the adult or the child will be miserable There is nothing whatever unnatural or wrong or shocking in this fact and there is no harm in it if only it be sensibly faced and provided for The mischief that it does at present is produced by our efforts to ignore it or to smother it under a heap of sentimental and false pretenses The child s rights being clearly those of any other human being are summed up in the right to live And the rights of society over it clearly extend to requiring it to qualify itself to live in society without wasting other people s time We must reconcile education with liberty We must find out some means of making men workers and if need be warriors without making them slaves In dealing with children what is needed is not logic but sense A child should begin to assert itself early and shift for itself more and more not only in washing and dressing itself but in opinions and conduct And what is a tyrant Quite simply a person who says to another person young or old You shall do as I tell you Children are extremely cruel without intending it and in ninety nine cases out of a hundred the reason is that they do not conceive their elders as having any human feeling Serve the elders right perhaps for posing as superhuman The penalty of the imposter is not that he is found out he very seldom is but that he is taken for what he pretends to be and treated as such The family ideal is a humbug and a nuisance one might as reasonably talk of the barrack ideal or the forecastle ideal or any other substitution of the machinery of social for the end of it which must always be the fullest and most capable life in short the most Godly life Even apart from its insufferable pretensions the family needs hearty discrediting for there is hardly any vulnerable part of it that could not be amputated with advantage Do not for a moment suppose that uncultivated people are merely indifferent to high and noble qualities They hate them malignantly Whether the risks to which liberty exposes us are moral or physical our right to liberty involves the right to run them A man who is not free to risk his neck as an aviator or his soul as a heretic is not free at all and the right to liberty begins not at the age of years but of seconds You may have as much fun at Shaw s expense as you want on the grounds that he has never had to train a child and therefore doesn t know the difficulties But if you want to laugh last don t read this preface or the play that follows it because he will make a laughing stock or a convert of you as surely as he will prove that he is far cleverer than you can ever hope to be Shaw and Ellen Key preach practically the same doctrine about the home both are temperamentally incapable of Charlotte Perkins Gilman s programme education outside the home Shaw because the school is as big a humbug as the family and Miss Key because even if institutions can thus rough plane the material that is to become a member of society nevertheless they cannot if they take in the major part of the child s education accomplish that which is needed first of all if we are to lift ourselves to a higher spiritual plane in an economically just society they cannot deepen the emotional life Her insistence is strongly upon the education of the feelings as the most important factor in the soul life In her vision of the renaissance of motherhood she begins with Nietzsche s dictum that a time will come when men will think of nothing except education Not that any one can be educated to motherliness but that our sentimentalization of motherhood as the ever holy ever infallible power must be abandoned and a quality of intelligent mother power cultivated by definite courses of training which she lays out in detail In view of the number of homes I know of that come legitimately under the Shaw denunciation I feel sometimes that any socialization of home life is more hopeful than an attempt to remodel the hopeless conditions inside the home Regard the parents you know the great mass of them outside the exceptions that encourage you to believe spasmodically in the beauty and noble need of parenthood If they are not cruel or stupid or ignorant or smug or righteous or tyrannical or dishonest or unimaginative or weak or quiet ineffectual they are something else just as bad It has come to the point where a good parent is as hard to find as an honest man Very seriously however there is hope in the situation there is renaissance in the air And it has its foundation in the sensible and healthy though so far only tacit admission that it doesn t matter so much what your child becomes as that he shall become something You can t do much with him anyhow and you may as well face it You can give him during his first few years the kind of foundation you think will help him and for the rest of the time you can do only one thing that he will really need from you you can develop your own personality as richly as you want him to develop his You can refuse to worry about him since that does neither of you any good and thereby save stores of energy that he may draw upon for your mutual benefit It becomes a sort of game for two instead of the uninteresting kind in which one player is given all the advantages Compared with it the old fashioned game in which the mother sacrificed everything suffered everything wore herself out trying to help her child win looks not only very unfair and very unnecessary but very wasteful And have you ever noticed how the man who sentimentalizes about the wonderful mothers we used to have his own in particular is the one whose life is lived at the opposite pole of the mother s wise direction If you disagree with all this there is still one other method by which you may produce a child who will be a credit to himself and to society You may be so utterly stupid and wrong headed that he will rebel to the point of becoming something different If you prefer this course no one need worry much about your child because he ll probably found a system of child education that will cause him to be famous and if you have a daughter she ll probably become a Montessori The new home is a recognition that the child is not the only factor in society that needs educating It assumes that no one s education is finished just because he s been made a parent It means that we can all go on being educated together It means the elimination of all kinds of domestic follies for one the ghastly embarrassment of growing up to discover that you re different from the rest of your family and for that reason something of a criminal It means the kind of understanding that develops a child s feeling instead of suppressing it so that he won t be ashamed for instance of having such glorious things as dreams and visions It means artistic education and Shaw says that we all grow up stupid or mad to just the extent to which we have not been artistically educated THE SWAN Under the lily shadow and the gold and the blue and mauve that the whin and the lilac pour down on the water the fishes quiver Over the green cold leaves and the rippled silver and the tarnished copper of its neck and beak toward the deep black water beneath the arches the swan floats slowly Into the dark of the arch the swan floats and into the black depth of my sorrow it bears a white rose of flame F S Flint DES IMAGISTES CHARLES ASHLEIGH A new and well born recruit has been added to the ranks of the Insurgents It is true he appeared before we did but we welcome him before he welcomes us and thus are things evened THE LITTLE REVIEW The Masses Poetry The International all bearers of the sacred fire and now cometh The Glebe heralding his approach with the chanting of many colored strains And among the good things which The Glebe has put forth is a book of portent Des Imagistes The Imagistes form one of the latest schools and it is meet that before we read their work we get some idea of their doctrine Therefore I transcribe here some statements of representative Imagiste poets which I have culled from Poetry The Egotist and other sources Richard Aldington gives the following rules I Direct treatment of subject We convey an emotion by presenting the object and circumstance of the emotion without comment For example we do not say O how I admire that exquisite that beautiful that more adjectives woman But we present that woman we make an Image of her we make the scene convey the emotion II As few adjectives as possible III A hardness as of cut stone No slop no sentimentality When people say the Imagiste poems are too hard we know we have done something good IV Individuality of rhythm We make new fashions instead of cutting our clothes on the old models V The exact word We make quite a heavy stress on that It is most important All great poetry is exact All the dreariness of nineteenth century poetry comes from their not quite knowing what they wanted to say and filling up the gaps with portentous adjectives and idiotic similes Here is a definition by Ezra Pound which helps us An Image is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time The book Des Imagistes is an anthology presumably of Imagist let us once for all Anglicize the French word and have done with it poetry Yet one of the foremost imagists Richard Aldington in a critique of this book comparatively modest owing to the fact that his own poems formed a sumptuous fraction of the volume says that five of those whose poems are there included are not true Imagists These are Cournos Hueffer Upward Joyce and Cannell Mr Aldington says he doesn t mean that these poems are not beautiful on the contrary he admires them immensely but they are not strictly speaking Imagist poems I agree that the poems of these five men are beautiful especially the I hear an army of James Joyce and the Nocturnes of Skipwith Cannell and I also maintain that all unconsciously the publishers of The Glebe have dealt a deadly blow to sectarian Imagism by including these non Imagist poems in their anthology Because unless a school can prove that it alone has that unnameable wonder which excites us to deepest emotional turmoil and which we call poetry it has but little right to isolate itself or to separate its adepts from the bulk of poets This may sound sententious but is nevertheless true Speak you in whatever mode or meter you will if you arouse me to exultation or to horror or to the high pitch of any feeling if in me there is that responsive vibration that only true art can produce then are you a poet Whitman does it to me Poe does it to me Baudelaire and Henley do it To all of these there is in me a response I m awfully sorry but that s how it is I think them all poets The Imagists believe in the direct presentation of emotion preferably in terms of objectivity They abhor an excess of adjectives and after a satiety of the pompous Victorian stuff I am much inclined to sympathize with that tenet of their faith I wish however to make clear my own position which is the one that most counts when I am writing I am an anarchist in poetry I recognize no rules no exclusions If the expression of a certain thought vision or what not requires twenty adjectives then let us have them If it be better expressed without adjectives then let us abjure them temporarily I am myself a poet whether performance equals desire is doubtful My object as a poet is to express the things which are closest to me This sounds banal but is better than rhetoric words exist not with which to define with superclarity the poet s function source and performance In the true expression of myself I might write Images which would be worshipped for their perfection by the Imagists A moment after I might gloat and wallow in the joy of my cosmic oneness anathema to Imagists and perhaps recall Whitman The next minute chronicling some shadowy episode of my variegated past I may out decay the decadent Baudelaire But this is always poetry if by the magic of its words and the music of its arrangement it speaks directly and beautifully to you giving you that indescribable but unmistakeable sense of liberation and soul expansion which comes on the contemplation of true art I think I have made myself clear There is no quarrel with the Imagists who have done some beautiful work as such But if they claim monopoly of inspiration or art as some of them appear to do then Therefore as a restricted and doctrinaire school a bas les Imagistes But as an envigored company of the grand army of poets Vivent les Imagistes OF RUPERT BROOKE AND OTHER MATTERS ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE Since even to poets and poets are erroneously supposed to sing their hearts out there remains a certain right of privacy I am not sure that we do well in writing so much of their personalities and their individual views of life When we read a poem we feel a temperament behind it but the effort to catalogue and label that mind and its message is a little impertinent and very futile Mr Rupert Brooke is an excellent illustration His fondness for this or that whether in landscape food ideas or morals is hardly our concern He deserves to be treated not as a natural history specimen a peculiar group of likes and dislikes and convictions but as an artist Mr Brooke has the distinction rare for a young poet of not having written any bad verse or of not having printed it His sole volume Poems Sidgwick and Jackson London manifests in even its least notable pieces a creative spirit not allowed to run riot but chastened and restrained by a keen sense of the obscure laws whose workings turn passion into a decorative pattern and the emotions of the blood into intelligible designs Unless one is deeply concerned with such things one is not likely to recognize the fundamental difference between those poets whose work is merely a more or less interesting emotional cry and those nobler and more mature poets in whose work the crude elements of emotion are subordinated to the exigencies of an artistic conception Only the latter have written fine poetry The former may move us as a crying child may move us but they cannot exalt us to a peak that rises above the region of mere sympathetic response They can never bring us a wind of revelation or a flame from beyond the world They are never the poets to whom other poets and these are the only final judges turn for inspiration or for fellowship For after all there is no magic in any theme or in the emotion behind it what is magical lies wholly in the design the mould in which the poet embodies a feeling that is probably common to all No thought is so profound no intimation so subtle that it alone suffices as the stuff of poetry But any thought any intimation if it be justly correlated and moulded into an organic and expressive shape will serve to awaken echoes of a forgotten or unknown loveliness and pierce its way into the very soul of the listener This sense of design of which I speak is not a hard formal conscious thing in the mind of the poet but rather a carefully trained instinct like the instinct that guides the hand of a fine draughtsman in the drawing of a curve of unexpected beauty There is a right place to begin the curve and a right place to end it and at every instant of its length it is swayed and governed by a sense of relation to preceding and succeeding moments a sense subject to laws that defy mathematical formulation but are perilously definite nevertheless This sense of control is a rare thing to find in the work of so young a man as Mr Brooke Most young writers seem to approach their work as an unrestrained expression of themselves which it should be but they forget that for real self expression the most scrupulous mastery of the medium of expression is necessary They regard the writing of verse as something in the nature of a joy ride with an open throttle instead of seeing in it a piece of difficult driving to be achieved only by the use of every subtlety of modulated speed and controlled steering that the mind is capable of employing That Mr Brooke needs no such warning let the following fine sonnet bear witness SUCCESS I think if you had loved me when I wanted If I d looked up one day and seen your eyes And found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted And your brown face that s full of pity and wise Flushed suddenly the white godhead in new fear Intollerably so struggling and so shamed Most holy and far if you d come all too near If earth had seen Earth s lordliest wild limbs tamed Shaken and trapped and shivering for my touch Myself should I have slain or that foul you But this the strange gods who had given so much To have seen and known you this they might not do One last shame s spared me one black word s unspoken And I m alone and you have not awoken It is significant that for his sonnets Mr Brooke frequently chooses the Shakesperian form a form which strangely English poets have generally for at least a century discarded in favor of the Petrarchan model The common feeling appears to be that the Petrarchan a b b a a b b a c d e c d e or some variation on that scheme is musical and emotional and that the Shakesperian a b a b c d c d e f e f g g is harsh cold mechanical and incapable of subtle harmonies The exact reverse of this is the case It is perhaps too much to ask the reader to write a sequence of a hundred sonnets in each form as a test but I am confident that after such an experience he would agree with me The Petrarchan form is capable of only one successful effect a rising on the crest of a wave whose summit is the end of the eighth line and a subsidence of the wave in the course of the last six lines The Shakesperian form on the other hand is capable of a literally infinite variety of effects no pattern is set arbitrarily in advance but as in blank verse any pattern may be created The first twelve lines which are nothing but three quatrains can be moulded into a contour that fits any shape or size of thought whatsoever and the couplet at the end a device despised by the ignorant may be used either to clinch the purport of the preceding twelve lines or to blend with them or startlingly to refute them or to serve any other end that the genius of the writer is capable of imagining The mere novice will like this form because of its simple rhyme scheme and its superficial ease of working the experienced amateur will prefer the Petrarchan form because while the more complex rhyme scheme presents for him no difficulties the basic inadequacies of his thought structure are fairly well concealed by the arbitrary sonnet structure but the master of imagination and expression is likely to follow Shakespeare and the novice in preferring the true English form wherein he can with perfect freedom create a subtly modulated movement that will answer to every sway and leap of his thought Mr Brooke whose sense of form is keen is one of those who can safely and wisely try the more interesting and more dangerous medium I have thought it worth while to talk a good deal of the sonnet in connection with Mr Brooke for the reason that several of his very finest pieces are in this form The following is one that stands a good chance of being in the anthologies a hundred years from now THE HILL Breathless we flung us on the windy hill Laughed in the sun and kissed the lovely grass You said Through glory and ecstasy we pass Wind sun and earth remain the birds sing still When we are old are old And when we die All s over that is ours and life burns on Through other lovers other lips said I Heart of my heart our heaven is now is won We are Earth s best that learnt her lesson here Life is our cry We have kept the faith we said We shall go down with unreluctant tread Rose crowned into the darkness Proud we were And laughed that had such brave true things to say And then you suddenly cried and turned away Perhaps as magical as any of Mr Brooke s work is a longer poem called The Fish a remarkable and original piece of fantasy that makes the sub aqueous universe vivid and real to the senses of the reader and opens to him a new world of imaginative experience Even the opening lines will serve to indicate something of the curious trance quality In a cool curving world he lies And ripples with dark ecstasies The kind luxurious lapse and steal Shapes all his universe to feel And know and be the clinging stream Closes his memory glooms his dream Who lips the roots o the shore and glides Superb on unreturning tides In other of these poems one is struck by Mr Brooke s passion for ugliness He loves to take the most hideous and base facts of life and give them a place in his work alongside the things of beauty It would be hard to find anything more humorous and at the same time more repulsive than this WAGNER Creeps in half wanton half asleep One with a fat wide hairless face He likes love music that is cheap Likes women in a crowded place And wants to hear the noise they re making His heavy eyelids droop half over Great pouches swing beneath his eyes He listens thinks himself the lover Heaves from his stomach wheezy sighs He likes to feel his heart s a breaking The music swells His gross legs quiver His little lips are bright with slime The music swells The women shiver And all the while in perfect time His pendulous stomach hangs a shaking Now a passion for ugliness like this is really a revolt against ugliness not the tender skinned sthete s revolt which consists in denying ugliness and escaping into a remote dream but the strong man s the poet s the revolt that is in effect a seizing of ugliness in all its repulsiveness and giving it a reason for existence by embodying it in a chosen pattern that is beautiful By this method the poet masters emotion even unpleasant emotion making it subservient to a decorative design dictated by his own sense of proportion It is thus that he is able to endure the world of actualities and to find it comparable in interest with the world of his own thoughts And by this process he saves himself from the sharpest bite of evil For there is a curious consolation in transforming a spontaneous cry into a calculated work of art By such a process one can give to elements that before seemed only parts of a torturing chaos their ordered places in a known scheme One can impose propitious form upon one s recollections and create a little world of design relations where the poignancy of experience is lost in the discipline of beauty It is for this reason that the poet must be considered in spite of everything the happiest of men THE NEW LOYALTY GEORGE BURMAN FOSTER Back to the Old Greek for a starting point Two seeds of the same species though distant in space and time go through an identical development Root corresponds with root stem with stem flower with flower fruit with fruit Something seems to control all this change It is not mere change It is change with a plan a purpose a pattern Hence the Greek said that there must be an unchanging type a fixed idea a spiritual invisible norm the first and final cause of all this change to which all concrete particular plants of the species are true Back of the visible tangible plant must be its Eidos its eternal norm form idea species So with everything An elaboration of this conclusion gives the real unchanging fixed eternal world back of underpinning supporting this visible changing temporal world Such a world view as this was made more valuable and more imperative by the break up of the traditional morals and religion of the Greek state The search for the meaning of life was precipitated by the disintegration of social sanctions and of the guarantees of custom This search was voiced in the questionings of Socrates It was made serious by the menacing individualism of the sophists The outcome was that stability security confidence were found in the Platonic doctrine Back of this ephemeral world is the real world of ideas the unchanging and eternal upon which we may rest our minds and hearts amid all this disappointing and desperate flux Passing by the Middle Ages which mutatis mutandis appropriated this scheme we pause over the significance of the Renaissance period Two things are uppermost in one s mind and as one thinks of the tumultuous beginnings of modern life which characterized the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries For one thing the Renaissance was the culmination of a long period of absorption in which men had been gradually working their way back by intellectual assimilation towards the beginnings of the rich tradition which Church and Empire had stored up This period of absorption was that five hundred years during which pagan hordes that had conquered Rome were conquered by the knowledge faith custom civilization of their victims From the cultural standpoint the new nations were hungry the larder of the old civilization was replete and hence authority on one side and absorption on the other became natural and inevitable Thus the philosophical preconceptions the cosmological ground principles the whole general attitude toward life s problems of the whole old world were fastened upon the mind of the young European peoples It must not be forgotten that all this was aat the hatural achievement of the new European life and genius but as foreign to it as inherited and at first as cherished as grandfatherly ideas are in the mind of a child If some day the child must shake off the old conceptions because he hears the call of life to go forth and achieve his own inner world it would be only natural to expect that this young European giant should some day struggle to cast aside his intellectual inheritance and go forth to conquer reality for himself in his own way with his own weapons Well and this is the second matter it was just that very thing that was happening in the early teens of our era The young western world began to look at life for itself and a curious astonished wild eyed look it was Europe had learned at its mother s knee to say The true world is fixed and final Reality is static But looking out now in wonderment seeing farther than the ancient world had ever seen the new world said Ah no The world is not static The world moves Things change Two well known anecdotes are told of Galileo which if not authentic are well invented The one tells how in the dome at Pisa during worship the litany or the sermon boring him he observed the cathedral chandelier move by the wind and studying its vibrations discovered a basic law of mechanics The profound meaning of this anecdote is obviously that God spoke to the man more effectively through the self moving pendulum than in the rigid immobile litany from a rigid immobile hieratic heart and that if we do not understand such litany and it bores us we may still devoutly worship by meditating upon what we can understand The other narrative tells how imprisoned tortured inwardly by a compulsory recantation Galileo gathered himself together and declared E pu se muove it moves though Galileo never uttered these words but the history of the world has uttered them for him Yes it moves itself this earth and in its motion it knocks everything down that is in its way Not the earth alone moves all that is in the world is eternal motion Man moves in space and time extensively and intensively Truth moves and moving demolishes thrones and altars Morality moves making ancient good uncouth Faith moves the human heart putting into it the pulse beat of its life and there is no way to stop this self moving Faith Those old stories are not true to fact but they are true to truth Galileo did say It is my opinion that the earth is very noble and admirable by reason of so many and so different generations and alterations which are incessantly made therein And Descartes joined him The nature of things physical is much more easily conceived when they are beheld coming gradually into existence than when they are only considered as produced at once in a finished and perfect state Thus these men and many others voiced the changed temper that was coming over the world the transfer of interest from the permanent to the changing Slowly the new attitude was adopted in many departments of knowledge but the facts of biology were apparently all against its becoming a general philosophical movement The species of plants and animals had every appearance of being fixed and final unchangeably stamped once for all upon the sentient world by the Creator Not only so but the wonderful adaptation of organism to environment of organ to organism a marvelous and delicate complexity of teleological adjustment seemed to testify unanswerably to the reality of fixed and final types to a static underpinning for all this changing order Origin of Species That was the bomb with which Charles Darwin destroyed the last stronghold of a static world view Species is the scholastics translation of the Greek Eidos the fixed and final type or idea which is first and final cause of the changing life of each creature Species is a synonym and epitome of fixity and finality it is the key word of a static other world reality When Darwin said Origin of Species he was cramming the conflict of the ancient wisdom and the modern knowledge into a bursting phrase When he said of species what Galileo said of the earth e pu se muove he emancipated once for all genetic and experimental ideas as an organon of asking questions and looking for explanations He lifted the biological gates which had kept back the flood of change from inundating the old fields of fixity In sum The world of thought is slowly painfully making a change in its fundamental attitude toward reality such as is not made oftener than once in several millennia One general conception of reality was all controlling for years Then from Copernicus to Darwin many factors in a world subversive change were struggling for recognition Conceptions that had reigned in the philosophy of nature and of knowledge for years rested in the superiority of the fixed and final they rested on treating change and origin as signs of defect and unreality In laying hands upon the sacred ark of absolute permanency in treating forms that had been regarded as types of fixity and perfection as originating and passing away the origin of species introduced a mode of thinking that in the end was bound to transform the logic of knowledge and hence the treatment of all our values and verities and virtues But heaven and earth and species are not all Shall there be no Copernicus of the moral heavens no Galileo of the moral earth no Darwin of the moral life Hove now Friedrich Nietzsche into sight Loyalty has ever been the basic virtue foundation of life and of law Naturally in the moral world the objects to which loyalty shall be related will be objects that are real But as we have seen in the old world the real was the unchangeable the immobile the finished the final the absolute To these therefore the old loyalty was directed and dedicated Comes now Friedrich Nietzsche a man in whose name the entire moral revolution of our time has found its most pregnant expression and declares war upon that old loyalty and does so in the name of a new culture a new humanity To him this loyalty is not only an empty folly it is more than that a crime against life a weakening of human power To him not stationariness but self changing is the life task of man He feels himself akin only to him who changes Every moment of life has an existence a right a content of its own No present point of time has a right to lay claim on its own account to the next point From what we now will think feel no man may presume to require us to will think feel the same way tomorrow And this preaching of Nietzsche s on the duty of change as against the old duty to change never has found more ears to listen and more hearts to believe than any other preaching of our time This new preaching is at once most influential and most dangerous But its very dangerousness is a most wholesome and necessary part of the modern moral view of life Is loyalty then something about which there is nothing to be learned Is there no counterfeit and caricature of loyalty No mask behind which men hide their indolence and complacency and thoughtlessness You meet a man whom you have not seen in long years and you say to him Why you have not changed a bit you are precisely the same as in the old days Have you praised him necessarily If he left you as a child looking and speaking and thinking and acting like a child ought he not to have changed Does a fruit remain what it was as bud and blossom Life is development but development is a constant self changing Development is an incessant dis loyalty to what is already there And if man just because he is man and has a will of his own and can set himself against the law of development should sell his life to the force of inertia would not that be a crime against life And yet even such a deed men call loyalty Men say that they want to be faithful to the heritage of the fathers Which is often enough simply to say that they mean to store away their heritage where it will be kept from the world s light and air that would destroy it but where also it can enter into no human intercourse serve no life fulfil no end of life This loyalty of unchangeableness to the heritage puts the talent in a napkin and there can be no increase Men say that they mean to abide faithful to their faith unto death Often enough this is only stubbornness and narrowness It requires no art and no merit to exercise such faithfulness All one needs to do is to close one s eyes and ears to what lies beyond the bounds of this faith to forego the questionings and uncertainties that others must pass through and then to send in one s claim to the reward and gratitude due such loyalty Today it is quite the thing at college commencements to spy out the men who are models of such loyalty and to say Look how firm and steadfast and rock like they are But it cannot be denied that much of this illustrious loyalty is nothing but natural or voluntary incapacity to think more widely than others have taught them to think or for the matter of that permitted them to think Back of this bragging about principles which are vainly declared to be unshakable there is frequently nothing but an ill natured obstinacy whose so called principles have no other basis than the self interest to which they are contributary It was this loyalty to the finished finished cult finished belief finished customs and practices finished religion and morality that stoned the prophets and crucified Jesus It was this kind of loyalty that the mediaeval church imposed upon the Faithful imprisoning the conscience therein for time and for eternity Bound by an oath of loyalty the priest renounced the world the monk and nun under monastic vows dedicated their lives to the church their services to heaven And hence it marked an epoch when Luther called their loyalty a sin and went forth into the world the home the vocation the business breaking the vows of priest and cloister Was such disloyalty to a sacred obligation loyalty in the sixteenth century and shall it be blasphemy in the twentieth Is it not rather a blasphemy to preach to men a loyalty which obligates them to forego the use of their best and noblest powers which condemns them to spiritual standstill in the eternal progressive movement of life Take some illustrations which will test insight and courage There is the constitution of the United States Shall we assume toward it the loyalty of fixedness and finality or the loyalty of change No man of veneration and equipoise would favor capricious or precipitate or superfluous change in so noble a document But for all that the experience of life made the constitution for life s sake and the maker is more than the made If our national life pass as pass it has into new seas and under new stars where life needs a change of the constitution then the principle which prompted the people to frame the constitution in the first place requires them to change it to meet the new needs of our growing and changing national life The superficial loyalty to the changeless letter must yield to the profound loyalty to the ever changing spirit The constitution is for the sake of the people not the people for the sake of the constitution They rather than it are sacred Similarly there is the modern problem of marriage the family and the home Shall ours be the old loyalty that holds the customs of the past inviolable marriage indissoluble the inherited patterns of home and family unchangeable the loyalty of fixedness and finishedness or shall it be the loyalty of change in all these matters to meet the changing needs and situations of our burdened and bewildered modernity Again no man of sanctity and sanity and stability of soul can favor any arbitrary radicalism that is subversive of time honored institutions for no better reason than a fleeting fancy or the passing of the romance of the honeymoon or raw self will or an unanticipated burden or hardship But for all that the marriage institution like all others is for the sake of man and not man for the sake of the institution It was life that originated our domestic ideas and customs and conventions and codes and if ever life in the interest of its well being and progress requires changes suited to new needs and new days then the new loyalty to life that ever changes must replace the old loyalty to codes that never change Codes too are for the sake of life not life for the sake of codes No loyalty to the letter that means disloyalty to the spirit And there is the everlasting problem of education Education in the past had for its subject matter symbols reading writing arithmetic grammar rhetoric logic and the like The new education has for its subject matter realities nature and history The old education taught topics or subjects the new education teaches boys and girls According to the old education knowledge precedes action according to the new education action precedes knowledge In the old education things were done to the pupils in the new education the pupils do things The old school teacher was a star and dwelt apart that is his aloofness and superiority were indispensable He taught from above The new school teacher is down among the students a democrat of democrats The old school teacher communicated knowledge from without the new school teacher develops interest from within The old education was atomistic the new organic The old education was a donation to the pupils the new is an achievement by them The old education proceeded on the assumption that man is primarily intellect the new that he is primarily will The old education preceded life and fitted for it the new education is a part of life itself It is a great change According to the old theory there was perfection to start with perfection at the top All that we needed was to pipe it down through aqueducts so well constructed that nothing that was in could get out nothing that was without could get in and thus thus only would the vain and empty world and life be filled with value and verity and virtue donation on the one side reception on the other But the time came when men asked if there is perfection to start with why start Why paint the lily And if there is perfection to start with how does there come to be imperfection How can imperfection come from perfection Ugly questions these Soon the world was turned upside down The new theory holds that matters began very humbly and struggled and fought their way slowly upward Ascent from below not descent from above No values or verities or virtues donated all achieved Education an evolution not a communication Some business men favor the old education Their world is one of mechanism and authority They think that they do not need men with initiative spontaneity freedom That is their prerogative as it was of the king of old They need the mechanical the automatic the impersonal in man This fits into their world This is what the old education stands for The new education unfolds and matures personalities Personalities make good masters but poor servants Business men as a class are perhaps our best men But the very conditions of business economy and certainty are the impersonal the unfree the mechanical So business has warped the judgment of some good men and led them astray on the most fundamental problem in the history of the race Were it not multiplying illustrations the same point might be urged as to politics Does not party loyalty often mean personal servility As a matter of fact what is loyalty in one situation or one age may be simple cowardice or abjectness in another The upshot is that the modern man has to endure the reproach of not thinking and feeling and judging and acting as men formerly did the reproach of perfidy toward the past its solutions and its sanctities In consequence it would not be a bad idea for him to cultivate respect for the past gratitude for its achievements appreciation for its unfinished tasks Still he should learn to accept the reproach as praise recognition that though problems remain the same solutions change though sanctity abide the objects which are sacred change Evolutionism no longer recognizes any fact as sacred Man is inwardly working on ever farther ever overcoming the old and conquering ever the new this must also be recognized It is said that we ought to love the old the finished But is love blind Does it consist in advocating the point of view of one s friend not because it seems true but just because love requires it Is loyalty of love the faculty of adaptation with which we remodel ourselves after the image of another Is one disloyal in love if one affirm one s self against another or if another affirm himself against one Surely fidelity of friendship even of marriage ought not to be the grave of one s own being Surely loyalty should be the life and not the death of one s self Surely we must all see with our own eyes hear with our own ears judge with our own judgments love with our own hearts for the quite plain reason that we have no others with which we can do these things And so if we take up this great subject in a large way as Nietzsche has done we see that we have all broken with the old loyalty and that the consummation of this breach has been life and blessing to us We moderns all somehow live in a disloyalty which we have committed imputed to us as transgression viewed by us as our strength and pride We have all become unfaithful as children to our parents as pupils to our teachers as disciples to our masters We felt ourselves bound to them we loosed ourselves from them The paths they walked we have forsaken In the strange untrodden land whither our vagrant feet have wandered we came to ourselves in declaring disobedience to the laws of tradition in breaking loyalty to the rules of the schools It is precisely on this account that once again we have won spiritual life a living art and science a living religion and morality We have snapped the fetters fastened upon us in the name of the old loyalty and all that is great and fruitful and constructive in the life of the modern spirit is a monument of the disloyalty which its creators have built thereto Nothing is gained any longer by our screening ourselves behind this word loyalty and making believe that we shall not be found out We owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the world to confess frankly that we have done with the old loyalty to the unchangeable and the finished for that is to be loyal to an unreality since there is no such thing Even God if he be the living God cannot be the same yesterday today and forever But we owe it even more to ourselves and to the world to strive for a clear position in reference to this question which is so profoundly agitating our entire moral world today We may not abandon the field to those who would demolish the temple of the old goddess simply that they may celebrate upon its ruins the orgies of their caprice and inconstancy and characterlessness If ever there was a doctrine whose right is easily turned into a wrong whose truth into an error whose blessing into a curse it is this Nietzschean doctrine of the right and the duty of ceaseless change of self dependence by which we are redeemed from slavery to the past If the old loyalty loyalty to the past no longer holds men wherewith shall they be held Shall they be like the weathervane blown hither and thither by every wind of doctrine or like the rudderless ship driven aimless and planless over the high seas by the midnight hurricane Better a thousand times be tethered to the old loyalty than to be doomed to such a life of levity and poiselessness and flightiness But the new loyalty which we seek without which we go forward into no future should it not be more stable and enduring and loyal than the old If a moment releases itself from what to it is past and validates its right as a self dependent life to its predecessor a birth has transpired in man and birth means pain Without such pain man has changed his situation but not himself A new color has come upon the motly manifoldness of his life he has remained the same Trees do not have their roots in the air Weaklings cannot make the real change it needs a strength that they do not have The strength to change really only he has this who bears the new loyalty in his own bosom loyalty not to his opinion not to his learning and heritage but loyalty to his growth to the great eternal goal of life to the great sacred task which he has yet to fulfil in life Loyal to ourself Would that it might be so But the self that we would at first be loyal to is not our self at all It is foreign wares loaded upon us first even in the nursery slyly slipped subsequently upon our shoulders foreign words foreign worths Loyalty to what satiates not the better loyalty to our hunger We begin to live only when we live in our hunger our hunger is we ourselves It is a good satiety only if a new hunger comes from it Loyalty to our self this is to keep our life alive in us a young glad life that never grows old because the old is ever transmuted into a new This loyalty to ourself it is to expel from every truth its error from every boundary its limit which blocks the vision into the wide world the blue sky and the distant sea Loyalty to men Would that it might be so But such loyalty costs so much trouble and toil For the faithfulness that is genuine and living there is no law no binding I must only a glorious I will One day we shall have done with the loyalty which means master and servant leader and led the loyalty of the dog that is loyalest to him who feeds him best or beats him hardest One day we shall understand what the loyalty of man means this new loyalty toward man in which souls meet and chime and work together and live in each other yet each remains itself and true to itself So then the law of change and of growth is the law of the new loyalty as the law of fixedness and finishedness and finality was of the old It is the duty of such new loyalty to protect itself against the deadening force of habit and of petrifaction to guard itself against any obedience by which it would become disloyal to itself Such loyalty is too honorable to humor inertia and laziness under its banner too courageous to conceal cowardice behind a slave s patience But thought on our theme is usually lifted up to where the sky keeps company with the granite and the grass to a religious elevation Nor do we need stop short here Ultimately the new loyalty is loyalty to God the new God of whom something must be said later The God in whom all fulness dwells summons us to ever new truths and reveals underground wells of living water throwing its spray aloft on life s ferns and flowers To be loyal to him is never to sunder ourselves from his fulness and freshness but to co work with him who is forever making all things new And now I think we are at the end The result It is needless to state it but I would not shrink from the thankless task In a word then the new loyalty in harmony with the whole great changed view of the world and of life is loyalty to change and becoming rather than to finishedness and finality to the future rather than to the past to ideals rather than to conventions to freedom rather than to authority to personality rather than to institution to character rather than to respectability to our hunger rather than to our satiety to the God that is to be rather than to the God that is Thus the loyalty abides but the objects of loyalty change and pass THE MILLINER SADE IVERSON All the day long I have been sitting in my shop Sewing straw on hat shapes according to the fashion Putting lace and ribbon on according to the fashion Setting out the faces of customers according to fashion Whatever they asked for I tried to give them Over their worldly faces I put mimic flowers From out my silk and velvet garden I bade Spring come To those who had seen Autumn I coaxed faded eyes To look bright and hard brows to soften Not once while they were looking in the glass Did I peep over their shoulders to see myself It would have been quite unavailing for me Who have grown grey in service of other women To have used myself as any sort of a model Had I looked in the mirror I should have seen Only a bleached face long housed from sunshine A mouth quick with forced smiles eyes greyly stagnant And over all like a night fog creeping Something chill and obscuring and dead The miasmatic mist of the soul of the lonely When night comes and the buyers are gone their ways I go into the little room behind my shop It is my home my silent and lonely home But it has fire it has food there is a bed Pictures are on the walls showing the faces I kissed in girlhood I am myself here All my forced smiles are laid away with the moline And the ribbon and roses I may do as I please If I beat with my fists on the table no one hears If I lie in my bed staring staring No one can know I shall not suffer the pity Of those who passing see my light edge the grey curtain One night long ago merely for madness I stripped myself like a dancing girl I draped myself with rose hued silks And set a crimson feather in my hair There were twists of gold lace about my arms And a girdle of gold about my waist I danced before the mirror till I dropped Outside I could hear the rain falling And the wind crept in beneath my door Along my worn carpet I folded my finery And prayed as if kneeling beside my mother Whether there was listening I cannot say There was praying There was praying Never again shall I dance before the mirror Bedizened like a dancing girl never my mother I have a low voice and quiet movements And early and late I study to please As long as I live I shall be adorning other women I shall be decking them for their lovers And sending them upon women s adventures But none of them shall see behind this curtain Where I have my little home where I weep When I please and beat upon the table with my fists NUR WER DIE SEHNSUCHT KENNT MARGARET C ANDERSON In one of Chicago s big department stores of the cheaper type you may provided you re something of a poet walk straight into the heart of a musical adventure It is that amazing resentful and very satisfying adventure of discovering genius at work under the by no means unique condition of being unrecognized You go to one of the upper floors where the big lunch room is You find a table near a platform in the center on which sit four musicians a pianist a cellist a clarinet ist if there is such a thing and a second violinist You expect the usual clamor Suddenly you notice a fifth figure who has been sitting quietly in the background She comes forward with a violin in her hand and stands ready to play There is something still about her that quality of stillness which is invariably the first thing you notice in any dynamic She seems not scornful of her surroundings but quite indifferent to them not arrogant but sure of power not timid and yet incredibly soft and shy and serious She is plainly foreign she is German looks French and plays like a Viennese Or to be exact she merges the German heaviness with the Viennese gay sadness and the result is a sensuousness that is both deep and clear with the haunting wail that distinguishes all the music which comes from Vienna She looks almost like a little girl but you would notice her any place because of that stillness and the haunting appeal that always attaches to a certain type of eyes and mouth the kind which seem to say I will make music for you I will take you to a new world I will do it because I can dream intensely She begins to play and you understand why you watched her The depth of it startles you at first it is so big so moving so almost uncanny coming from such a small person whose hands seem scarcely large enough to hold a violin It is playing of the Mischa Elman type without his emotional extravagances and with something that is more soul shaking If I were an Imagist I could find the right word but this music eludes me It is sure and simple It grips you till you don t know whether you are listening to music or to the urge of some hidden inner self It is a divine thing In the midst of it the waitresses rush back and forth the patrons eat their food with interest only pausing to applaud when some tawdry vaudevillian sings a particularly vulgar song The dishes clang some one upsets a tray with a great crash and at intervals there is a tango outrage by a couple who know nothing about dancing Underneath it all the violin throbs its deep accompaniment I wish I could make a poem of it I have thought of taking my poet friends there and having the thing done But almost without exception the poets I know don t care for music essentially though why a mind keyed to the tone qualities of words should be so tone deaf in another medium has always been a mystery to me And what a poet s opportunity here the boom and squeal and out of it music that is as sacred as an organ meditation and as passionate as a Russian slave song However generalizations will not serve to give any musician s special quality and this one is so emphatically individual as to make description easy To begin with she was concertising in Europe as a wonder child at the age of six For a number of years her playing brought forth a chorus of superlatives from the critics her full blooming tone her great taste in phrasing economic use of the bow glowing passion of interpretation her fiery temperament remarkable earnestness and will power the soul life and emotion in her presentations The verdict of a a veritable artist soul appeared to be unanimous and one man summed up with admirable insight and simplicity Her chief excellence is in this that she seeks her main task to be an artist in the real and earnest sense of the word and whosoever comes to hear music does not go empty from her Friedrich Spielhagen wrote a sonnet to her of which I have a careful but metrically inadequate translation Thou standst before us a picture of wondrous charm The little violin thou holdst in tenderess Half maidenly half like a child in dress Hast soared away from Heaven s angel farm Toward where thy large mild eye is dreaming And he ended it with these lines Thou movest thy bow No sounds are these of nicely mov d strings No No Thy own sweet soul rings out and sings The melodies that have with you come From yon high wide sphered home To where thy longing soul swings upward now Our apologies to Mr Spielhagen for that more than atrocious twelfth line and for the other deficiencies But the last line is particularly keen in its photography It has the spirit of her After much touring in Europe she came to this country and played under the same promising conditions The critics predicted that if she should decide to stay here she would probably out rival our own few noted women violinists And then came a period of sorrow bereavement hardship and illness and in the meantime the problem of living That problem becomes a real one when an artist loves life just a bit more than her art and refuses to make that spiritual compromise which life tries to wrest from one in the hard places One must live and it takes money to do it rather than art The romantic notion that all genius has to do is to stand up and make itself heard is one of the silliest notions the great public suffers from Only the hundredth person recognizes genius when it proclaims itself the rest are as blind as this department store audience until the sign posts have been put up with letters large enough to be easily read Also the amount of machinery and money involved in the arrangement of concert engagements would surprise the public as much as the true stories of what it costs the wealthy patron to get his artist started toward recognition And so this particular genius will continue for a while to cast her pearls in a lunch room and a few of the discerning will find her out and thank their stars that they may hear such beauty at the small cost of a bad club sandwich and a worse cup of coffee If you go there you will be haunted by music for days afterward I say haunted because that is the only word to describe your feeling of pursuit by melody And I think I have discovered the reason for it A poet once said that the only permanent emotion we human beings are capable of is not love as we like to imagine but longing And that is what this music says to you It is the very essence of longing the eternal seeking the rapturous satisfaction the disappointment and the renewed quest I have never heard such a quality of sehnsucht in any music it is almost more than you can bear Of course in these surroundings you must listen to the complete gamut of new popular songs but at intervals when the managerial demand for noise can be ignored for a moment you will be rewarded by the Thais Meditation or a Schutt waltz or that exquisite Saint Saens poem called The Swan or even a Tschaikowsky song Where does the tone come from you keep wondering Not from a wooden instrument not from small human fingers surely It is tone of such richness and depth that you sometimes have the illusion of each note being sung twice It transcends music to me entirely and becomes a matter of life or of soul said a critic who listened with me the other day Through it all the artist s earnest face is still and unchanging That is part of the fascination the contrast of that tumultuous singing and the thoughtful dreaming face that seems to control it all My violin belongs to me yes she says but that is such a cold word It is part of my body I feel it is growing on me just like my arms and hands I could not live without it If you watch her closely you will decide that her playing is the result of an extraordinary sensitiveness to life If you know her as I do you will expand that judgment to this one an extraordinary strength about life for she is both deep and strong qualities that are supposed to be inseparable but which are so rarely found together that their combination means a great spirit I am afraid I am too much of a musician not to be a romanticist With out music life to me would be a mistake Nietzsche to Brandes All restlessness misery all crime is the result of the betrayal of one s inner life Will Lexington Comfort in Midstream EDITORIALS Our New Poet Charles Ashleigh who makes his appearance in this issue was born in

men To spread at ease under the sky In granite lipped basins Where iris dabble their feet And rustle to a passing wind The water fills the garden with its rushing In the midst of the quiet of close clipped lawns Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone Where trickle and splash the fountains Marble fountains yellowed with much water Splashing down moss tarnished steps It falls the water And the air is throbbing with it With its gurgling and running With its leaping and deep cool murmur And I wished for night and you I wanted to see you in the swimming pool White and shining in the silver

Pound NEW YORK LETTER GEORGE SOULE GEORGE BRANDES A HASTY IMPRESSION The man who fought the big battle for Ibsen and Nietzsche should have filled Madison Square Garden as it was the little Comedy Theatre wasn t large enough to hold the audience although Scandinavian patriotism accounted for a good deal of it He came on the stage with Brander Matthews the apotheosis of the academic and the contrast was striking Matthews was tall dull professional Brandes with his keen face alert eyes and shock of grayish hair was possibly the most fully alive person in the room He radiated interest human connection with anything vital We were all a little sorry his subject was Shakespeare we wanted to hear of something modern And when the first part of the lecture was read couched in scholarly but terse English we felt cheated It was good criticism and informing but it wasn t the sort of thing we had expected from Brandes Suddenly a spark shot out The quotation is from memory We cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that all works of literature which have a real effect on mankind all works which endure hundreds of years find their inspiration not in books but in life The words were pronounced with excited intensity Soon came another We used to define the genius as the man who interprets his age now we know that the genius is the man who working against his age creates new times Dr Brandes broke into a lively sally at the Baconians He spoke of Shakespeare s errors in scholarship These Bacon would surely have avoided but of Shakespeare s great lines Bacon could not possibly have written one He ended that section with something like this The Baconian theory was founded by the uneducated it was developed by the half educated and it is now held solely by idiots The audience was immensely pleased at his sharp fire Dr Brandes epigrams sometimes sound as if he substituted wit for wisdom But that is because the epigrams stick and are repeated His method is to open with an epigram to catch the attention to proceed with a line of sound argument and at the end to finish superbly with a sentence that contains his conclusions and impales his opponent at the same time With Frank Harris Dr Brandes was no more gentle By parallel quotation Harris was made to appear ridiculous Brandes showed that whatever in his writings is sound has been said before This was the end of the lecture Mr Harris says that it is possible to admire Shakespeare but that it is impossible to worship him Ladies and gentlemen I do the impossible Afterwards came a supper of the Scandinavian Society at which the guest of honor made a speech that looked brilliant and was lively even as a piece of pantomime but it was in Danish Dr Brandes was beaming and unaffectedly cordial with everybody He smilingly interrupted one of the pompous addresses in his honor to correct a quotation from Goethe He proposed a toast to the charming young lady who acted as his American manager and said that the success of his tour was due entirely to her Later a consul made a highly complimentary but exceedingly tedious speech Dr Brandes fidgeted until he could stand it no longer then he quickly got up took his champagne glass ran over to the orator and slapped him on the shoulder saying You are a very nice man The rest was drowned in the toast A NEW LITERATURE The other day an illustrator saw a hand mirror in a publisher s office He put the mirror against a book cover and held it at arm s length There he said is the ideal jacket for a novel Every woman likes to imagine herself the heroine of the book she is reading But the publisher was wiser You are half right he answered But she wants to be a Gibson heroine To see her own face without flattery would startle her into disapproval of the book A recent symposium in The Sun bore the impressive title The Sentimentalization of Woman in American Fiction All the authors were agreed that realism doesn t go because of the desire of the reader to be flattered If she isn t the novel is unpleasant depressing You may paint your villainess black but as your reader will take her for an enemy you must see that she is properly punished But if your heroine does anything unconventional it must be of the kind that your reader enjoys by imagination though she wouldn t have the courage to do it Only you must not make the thrills so strong as to shock the reader into self consciousness and self disapproval Georg Brandes said that our novels are written by old maids for old maids If we would only put into our literature the same genius and daring that we put into our skyscrapers The thing none of the authors seemed to see is that it is futile to stop at blaming the readers Of course the great public is comparatively stupid It is everywhere it always has been and always will be What is a leader if he is not someone in advance of the others And the essential act for a leader is to lead He can t get a following until he does that Only a coward stays behind and flatters the crowd because he is afraid they will not come after him Perhaps they won t follow his particular route But if he goes on fearlessly he has done the best that is in him anyway The chances are that if he has a sincere conviction and marches far enough in one direction they will at least struggle along after a while They may even follow in hordes What we need first is not a more intelligent public but courageous writers Naturally the matter is not simple Your artist has to be fed and clothed If he is creating a new medium as did Wagner he even needs large resources to produce his art The solution used to be the wealthy patron The petty monarch maintained a musician or a painter to enhance the glory of his court The noble supported a writer from personal pride The monastery afforded a refuge for the unworldly creator It would be difficult to find a great artist before the last century who did not have some such subsidy unless he had means of his own Since then democracy has permeated the world Fast presses advertising and royalties have been invented Now the public is the writer s patron Music is often subsidized to be sure and painters can still sell their canvases to the wealthy But the earnings of the writer are in strict proportion to the number of copies of his books that can be sold There is a distinct advantage in this situation The virtue of democracy is not the government of the majority but the opportunity of the minority The minority becomes not a defensive close corporation but a body of fighting visionaries The emphasis is placed on growth The eternal impulse of the minority to turn itself into a majority prevents a static age The strongest lead instead of the highly born So it must be with our writers Difficulty insures heroes We can discount at once the truckling commercial writers But the others must be deeply sincere and strong in order to exist at all There is little room for the dilletante Let our young people who have something to say recognize the situation They must dedicate themselves to a probable poverty They must gird their loins and sharpen their weapons They must be prepared to wait years if need be even for recognition Every energy must be devoted to saying as well as may be the thing that is in them And so hoping nothing fearing nothing living simply supporting themselves as best they may but always doing the thing that is worth while for its own sake they may produce a literature that has not been equalled since the world began Others of us can share in this glorious undertaking Discerning critics must sift the true from the false They must lay aside the twin snobberies of praising or blaming a work because of its popularity They must fight eternally for the sincere They must point out directions they must prize meanings above methods They must give a nucleus to the intelligent reading public and constantly augment it They must bear sturdy witness to the fact that art is not an amusement for idle moments but the consciousness of the race They must show its relation to life as well as to living They must be predisposed in favor of no work on account of its nationality school or tendency Just as Brandes enlarged the conception of literature by showing it as a world phenomenon they must rid it of petty divisions in the realm of thought No more should such a statement as Galsworthy is a poet rather than a novelist be allowed to pass as criticism A novelist may be a poet or a philosopher or a psychologist or a historian or a sociologist Any of these may combine the intrinsic abilities of any or all of the others He is greater for doing so The only test of his work is its effectiveness A work of art is an organism the highest product of nature infinitely more real more beautiful more potent than any flower Only when we see it as such and not as a collection of petals and stamens or as a member of a species shall we know it The whole problem of creating a literature as of doing anything else is one of direction and power If we blame someone else for our deficiencies if we stand aloof if we bow to circumstances and are afraid to pay for what we want we shall of course do nothing And we shall not enjoy ourselves or the world much either But if we fix on a goal that is worth a life and set out for it with the joyous spirit of adventurers risking everything enduring everything sleeping under the stars staying hard and keen we shall command the fates What more could we ask of the world DOSTOEVSKY S NOVELS MAURICE LAZAR The Idiot The Brothers Karamazov Crime and Punishment etc translated by Constance Garnett The Macmillan Company New York It s not a matter of intellect or logic it s loving life with one s inside with one s stomach Ivan Karamazov Chiefly concerned with the fester of civilization literature music painting all the modern forms of individual expression are elliptical in the sense that the old sthetic values of emotional beauty seem to have become nullified or else congealed in the artist s direct application of his instrument to the repudiation of fixed social values or moralities to the expansion of life interests We today want more than beauty of external form we want the beauty of depth The true artist is such primarily because of his engrossing appetite for life because as Flaubert said of the chaos in his soul And although Flaubert kept on chiseling words around the lives of men and women totally devoid of inspirating individuality his dictum has been nobly exemplified in the life and writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky that great hearted epileptic Russian of whose psychological powers Nietzsche admittedly availed himself Tolstoy was reported to have said in conversation with a writer for Le Temps A woman who has never suffered pain is a beast He could have stretched the allegation to include the other sex if only by way of illusion to that intense spiritual quality in modern Russian literature a literature that has never been notably an off shoot of as much as a protest against the retrogressive structures of its respective periods This spiritual or psychical concern with the individual s adjustment to the functioning of life has been revealed to highest degree in Dostoevsky s novels It is also manifest in the analytical mould assumed by the creative arts of our time While Dostoevsky s personality is separably bound up with his work profitable appreciation of the latter can be considerably amplified with knowledge of the important facts of his life and the conditions with which he struggled I will record the more essential facts of his life as I have gathered them and try to explain the causes that have made for the distinction in his work from that of all other writers He was born in a charity hospital in Moscow in His father was an army surgeon his mother a store keeper s daughter I like to think that he derived his expressive powers or rather the nebul out of which they subsequently developed from his mother perhaps partly because of my theory that men of acute genius ultimately do transcend the difference of sex in the quality of their personalities as well as in that of their work Like most imaginative youths who come into contact with fine art Dostoevsky was stimulated to literary expression by his study of classical and contemporaneous European literature He had lived twenty three years when he graduated from a St Petersburg school of military engineering His first novel Poor Folk was published three years later and served to focus upon him the attention of the critics In Dostoevsky was arrested with members of a radical organization on governmental charges of sedition The terrible suffering he sustained while awaiting his execution he was first confined in prison for eight months have been set forth in striking passages of his novels The Idiot and Letters from a Dead House The sentence of death was finally and very unexpectedly commuted to one of imprisonment in Siberia for four years At the expiration of this period he served perforce as a private soldier in the Russian army for three more years When he was permitted to return to St Petersburg he was accompanied by his first wife whom he had loved and married while in exile Dostoevsky s interminable suffering from epileptic seizures it has been suggested that these fits originated in a beating administered to him by his father when Fyodor was a boy his poverty and the constant accumulation of debt the terrific haste with which he found it necessary to write his most profound books all have made it natural to him in dwelling upon any physiological aspect of his characters to be as unconvincing as the eremite attempting an analysis of conditions of sex life In short Dostoevsky s nervous disorders pervaded his sensual sense of beauty of beauty in all its manifestations At the same time it must be remarked that this negation of physical responsiveness surely intensified the acuteness of his mental vision which was otherwise refined emotionally by the results of his imprisonment and life long hardships And this also explains why Dostoevsky s novels are lacking so singularly in the tingle of the physical contact of his characters why the suffering of his men and women move us so profoundly why his writings are so uneven his dialogues of such elemental power and his purely descriptive passages so ordinary The elemental power in his dialogues is due chiefly to the vigor of action accredited his characters In his work is not to be found the picturesque phrase the adroitly turned period the illuminating metaphor the sequence of construction the tone or shading offered by the commingling of his objects Dostoevsky has no style of form his outlines are amorphous It is in his power of transcribing the living voice of recording in never failing reflex emotionalism the lives and deeds of his startling figures that he is supreme If you have read one of his books you know much of what he has to say His other works are repetitions mainly For Dostoevsky does not attempt to paint character and rarely does he stop to show the subtly reacting influence of environment upon his men and women Always he is concerned with the idea of the individual s personal adjustments to life Each book of his throbs with the discordant elements that clash over the establishment of this idea and always its conclusions are recognized That is why I regard Dostoevsky as an optimist And his emphasis on humanity s spiritual conception of life no matter what the cost grew more and more pronounced in his later works His faith in human beings is expressed in one set theme which can be conveniently resolved into terms of comparison on one hand the individual s evasion of life s realities by the exercise of material and therefore fictitious values and on the other hand the frank acceptance of life s realities for the attainment of a proportionate spiritual balance In Crime and Punishment Dr Raskolnikov is in doubt as to the ultimate worth of this attainment until he expiates his crime in killing the old moneylender I forget her name not by confessing Dostoevsky is too fine a realist for that but by obtaining personal solace from the regenerating qualities of his resignation And it is characteristic of our writer s method that Raskolnikov is assisted toward this state of resignation by his love Sonia the prostitute whose regard for the murderer is based upon the confirmation evidenced in him of the faith that has been stimulated in herself Similar in thesis though expressed in terms of minor differences is Dostoevsky s last and unquestionably finest work The Brothers Karamazov It is incomplete actually one third as long as he had intended it to be He died before he could finish the book Nevertheless it is compactly formed material as the work now stands and superior to his other novels not because his outlines are more constrained his movement more co ordinate and the actual writing of a more intensive quality but because here he defines his own conception of spiritual beauty in a distinctive fashion not to be found in his other books He offers us the history of a family and what a family Each figure in this domestic group embodies conflicting phases of his great idea Fyodor Karamazov the father is a sensualist of the lowest type imaginable His three sons are Dmitri Ivan and Alyosha There is also another illegitimate son Smerdyakov an epileptic Dmitri Karamazov inherits his father s passion for wine women and song but the son s pursuit of this tame and conventional item is tempered by frequent lapses by periods of misgiving The second son is a materialist and a cynic He changes his mind after a severe illness and his materialistic beliefs are all but supplanted by intense spiritual curiosity The third and youngest son is an idealist lovable and loving Here again we have Dostoevsky s discordant elements conveyed in terms of human characterizations The plot of the story is as formless as life itself for it is with life not with plots that Dostoevsky deals Dmitri s hatred of his father is intensified by the rivalry that exists between the two in their common pursuit of Grushenka s affections Grushenka is a woman of the demi monde The author I think tried to draw her in lines that would reveal a physical zest of life as evidenced for example in Tolstoy s Anna Karenina His failure to make Grushenka a convincing individual as an individual is typical for the reasons I have already advanced Development of the story shows how Dmitri s repeatedly avowed determination to kill his father bears fruit The elder Karamazov is found dead one night with his skull crushed Dmitri is imprisoned And the rest of the book which is devoted to Dmitri s trial the moral regeneration of Ivan and the urge of life in Alyosha approaches psychological heights or depths that have not been surpassed to this day Small wonder that Nietzsche referred so affectionately to the giant spirit I have made reference to Dostoevsky s optimism A better word for it is faith faith of a new high order He is the most cheerful sunlight giving writer in Russian literature The essence of religious feeling says Prince Myshkin in The Idiot does not come under any sort of reasoning or atheism and has nothing to do with any crimes or misdemeanors Prince Myshkin is the central figure of the novel he is the idiot and everybody abuses him He is insulted and beaten and robbed and deceived and loved He is the most singular figure in literature he is Dostoevsky himself But he is not an idiot in any sense He is so profoundly simple and wise and has such great faith in human beings that he is mistaken by the men and women of ordinary passions as a fool While he can be readily toyed with by women a significant phase of the writer s own attitude toward the sex Prince Myshkin is regarded by them from a common basis of understanding For them he holds no quality of sex Perhaps you don t know that owing to my illness he says he too is an epileptic I know nothing of women It is in The Idiot that Dostoevsky s women are at least life like The Epanchin sisters especially the youngest Aglaia are not types in the usual sense but preconceived studies The pages devoted to Aglaia s love affair with Prince Myshkin are of the happiest in the book Besides the books I have already mentioned the more important works are The Possessed in which national politics play a large part Poor Folk the story of a poor clerk s love for a poor woman who eventually turns from him and Letters from a Dead House This last is a book of personal experiences and reveals Dostoevsky s relations with the criminals with whom he was imprisoned in Siberia The mental temper of men who disregard and break the common and social laws is set forth with the passionate curiosity that lies behind all his probings of the human soul I am strongly tempted to offer quotations to show in this passage or that how deeply Dostoevsky looked into the most extreme boundaries of human sensibilities but on the whole extracts from his writings would do more harm than good His work is so disconnected though not in any sense detached that extracts could not serve here to indicate the amazing clarity of his vision His books arouse a feeling of wonder that there can be so many things in our own individual emotions with which we never before came into contact He moves us so profoundly because he tears his men and women out of their morally bound lives and makes them confront stupendous questions the questions of life He plies detail upon detail of human misery until one feels that the whole world is reeling from him then grows aware of the sweet white glow of Dostoevsky s faith and feels that life can hold no terrors that he is above the petty miseries of human strife That is why I say Dostoevsky s optimism is of the new high order Dostoevsky purges one s mind He makes you conscious of the beauty of a soul BOOK DISCUSSION AN UNREELING REALIST The Titan by Theodore Dreiser John Lane Company New York Theodore Dreiser possesses none of the standard qualifications for the art of fiction writing He is not imaginative but inventive he is not clever but clear he is not excited but calm Whatever the flaws in his considerable body of work no fair minded reader may say that it is made to catch popular applause Its tremendous distinction is sincerity Another characteristic which his novels exhibit is resolute purpose Dreiser is aiming at something and in The Titan the second book in an unfinished trilogy he takes a long if wobbly step toward it Previously to the publishing of this volume he had not even hinted at what he intended to work out One thing was certain he was not a trifler he was not trying to write best sellers literary success was not in his mind He had set out seriously and indefatigably to write not so much what he felt and thought as what he saw Some day he would try to get at the realities that lay back of their representations He would probably undertake to reveal the soul of the American nation He would pass through the growth stages of a nation and achieve some kind of spiritual national life In the last two pages of The Titan this guess at his purpose receives appreciable encouragement Moreover it is made evident for the first time in these concluding paragraphs that Dreiser s prosaic realism springs not only from a vague deep idealism but a large hidden spirituality For at the core of him Dreiser is a profoundly religious person Neither his style nor his stuff is far above the dead level of mediocrity in fact Dreiser s rhetoric is often inexcusably atrocious intentionally crude one is tempted to assert Obviously he is not interested in style he is conscious of something bigger than that revealing itself in a huge ugly unfinished moving picture a net result symbolical of a young raw riotous unsynthesized national life One is therefore tempted to say that Dreiser more than any other author is the personification of America He represents the composite personality of Uncle Sam After reading The Financier and running far into the interminable pages of The Titan I felt that in the absence of cameras kodaks Baedekers and historians Dreiser would be worth while His endless reels of pictorial facts did not impress me as possessing sufficient animation successfully to compete with these odd rivals but I admired his consistent sincerity and simplicity and felt that something important was promised by the mere unfinishedness of his pictures I was sure that he did not write as one inspired and certainly not as one fired And after finishing The Titan I felt that here was a work having the aspects of a seriously performed duty exacted by fidelity to some personal theory of industrial change I could not imagine the author happy as an artist is happy in his creative work he was too conscious of service to a cause But in the last paragraph I discovered a big personal note which introduced an attitude that extends beyond the borders of materialism It presented another Dreiser an author who was much more than a cinematograph snapping superficial impressions of a vast panorama Two years ago I should not have attributed the following words to Theodore Dreiser In a mulch of darkness is bedded the roots of endless sorrows and of endless joys Canst thou fix thine eye on the morning Be glad And if in the ultimate it blind thee be glad also Thou hast lived After laboring through arid deserts of description this memorable passage fraught with recognition satisfaction challenge hope and promise stands out as an oasis The Titan by virtue of its bold graphic strokes loses its identity as a tree with sharply defined individual characters and represents the forest It is more like a jungle and the jungle is our national life into which the morning sun inevitably will shine DeWitt C Wing THE REVOLT OF THE ONCE BORN Challenge by Louis Untermeyer The Century Company New York There has recently appeared a volume of verse by Louis Untermeyer which is an excellent example of the determinedly young and eupeptic philosophy so prevalent today the philosophy of revolt The book is named Challenge and as challenge it must be considered To be sure it is rhymed but the fact seems quite incidental To rhyme a polemic does not make it poetry and one feels sure that Mr Untermeyer is more proud of the spiritual attitude than of the artistry The book is a revolt but a careful perusal of its pages fails to reveal against what it revolts At first glance one might think it socialistic but it is not clearly enough visualized for that Socialism has at least found the enemy Mr Untermeyer manfully girds on his armor and sets forth to war shouting his challenge lustily the while And why after all be particular about having an actual enemy Life with a capital L can do duty for that or the scornful and untroubled skies or the cold complacency of earth The revolt is the point and Mr Untermeyer drives it home with all the phrases of frozen impetuosity to be discovered in a very useful vocabulary Athletic courage eager night Life s lusty banner impetuous winds raging mirth etc are scattered carefully through the pages But unfortunately virility with all due respect to the reviewer who mentioned these poems in the June number of The Little Review has a way of oozing out of such phrases leaving them empty of everything save a painful determination to be manly at all costs But though Mr Untermeyer is not quite clear on some subjects he is very clear on others Several things seem to have struck him with peculiar force that city streets are dirty for instance that strife is tonic for young blood and that it is difficult for the human soul to conceive of complete annihilation These things he proclaims passionately and challenges the world to disprove them A little couplet from Kipling s Jungle Book suggests itself rather maliciously as the probable attitude of the world towards this outbreak There is none like to me says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill But the Jungle is large and the Cub he is small Let him think and be still Seriously however Mr Untermeyer s attitude is what William James calls the attitude of the once born One feels that he thinks in one dimension that he does not see around his subject nor hear the overtones which surround every happening for a man of deep intellect The revolt is Walt Whitman s magnificent revolt which is overpowering in a giant cropping out in a man of very ordinary stature where it sits a little ridiculously As philosophy much of this printed on a neat little card would do splendidly to hang in a business office for the encouragement of the employees As poetry it is negligible Mr Untermeyer lacks entirely the one gift which could redeem it the gift of poignancy This lack is particularly striking in the middle section called Interludes in which he pauses for a little from revolt These are love songs and lyrics a field in which anything not perfect is no longer acceptable And Mr Untermeyer s are not perfect His sense of rhythm is extremely primitive and his lyrics are full of words Only now and then when he forgets for a moment how manly he is does he say anything simply enough to strike home These lines for instance from Irony stick There is no kind of death to kill the sands that lie so meek and still But man is great and strong and wise And so he dies But in the main it is unfortunate that Mr Untermeyer who writes so much and so readably on the subject of poetry should put out so pretentious and undeveloped a volume as this is It is inevitable that it should affect his standing as a critic and there seems little doubt that his work in that field is really valuable to the cause of poetry in America today Eunice Tietjens TWO BIOGRAPHIES VERLAINE AND TOLSTOY Paul Verlaine by Wilfred Thorley Tolstoy His Life and Writings by Edward Garnett Houghton Mifflin Company Boston When autumn is in your heart not that of the golden delirium of exotic agony but bleak weeping autumn of crucifixion and dead leaves what dirge what note haunts you in accompaniment to your grief Maddening darts from Tchaikowsky s Path tique or Weltschmerz moans from Beethoven s Marchia Funebre or an unuttered accord known only to your soul Or if you are a brother of mine do your lips soundlessly mutter this Les sanglots longs Des violons De l automne Blessent mon coeur D une langueur Monotone Don t you hear the resonance of the tolling bells in Chopin s Funeral March Your sorrow grows crescendo as you proceed recalling Massenet s El gie Tout suffocant Et bl me quand Sonne l heure Je me souviens Des jours anciens Et je pleure Et je m en vais Au vent mauvais Qui m emporte De del Pareil la Feuille morte When I think of Paul Verlaine I invariably recall Oscar Wilde despite or because of the abysmal dissimilarity of the two personalities The sincere ingenuous all loving child Paul and the thoroughly artificial paradoxical Oscar the typical Bohemian with the criminal face like that of Dostoevsky and the salon idol the refined and gorgeous bearer of the sun flower Fate had somewhat reconciled the two contrasts Both had been sinners both were condemned by society and imprisoned both had repented one in De Profundis where the haughty humility of the self enamored artist stirs us with its artificial beauty the other in the primitive Christian nay Catholic Sagesse Mon Dieu m a dit Mon fils il faut m aimer Some months ago in reviewing Edmond Lepelletier s voluminous book Paul Verlaine His Life and Work I remarked that the Poet of Absinthe and Violets was still awaiting his Boswell My view has not changed after reading Wilfrid Thorley s monograph on Verlaine but my wish for an adequate biography of the signer of Romances sans Paroles has now become counterbalanced by an earnest prayer that the memory of the poet may be saved from such indelicate manipulators as Mr Thorley Why this respectable Englishman should have attempted to treat the life of the most wayward French poet since Villon can be explained by no other reason than that it was a case of made to order When a Velasquez is pierced by a fanatical suffragette the whole civilized world is roused to indignation but when an honest philistine unceremoniously puffs his cheap smoke into the face of a dead poet there is not a single protest against that sort of vandalism Fear of the editor s blue pencil restrains me from putting my attitude more outspokenly A conscientious compilator would have found sufficient material for an unpretentious sketch of the life of Verlaine and for an appreciation of his works Lepelletier gives an amazing mass of facts and personal reminiscences you may ignore his naive interpretations Arthur Symons in The Symbolist Movement in Literature has a masterpiece essay on Verlaine not to mention a number of other French and English writers who have given us glimpses of the imperceptible image of the poet writers who knew what they were taking about Mr Thorley has made use of various sources but in a peculiar way He fished out the anecdotal scraps the piquant details the filthy hints and patched up a caricature portrait of a lewd perverse undesirable whose poetry I quote reluctantly was born solely of the genitals whose life is but the trite old story of the emotions developed at the expense of domestic peace and civic order of art for art s sake made to condone the manner of its begetting and the trend of its appeal of the hushed acquiescence in emotion as a sacred thing whatever the quality of the impulse from which it ripens or the level of ideas on which it feeds Out of the ninety odd pages of stuff seventy nine are devoted to biography sufficiently spicy to make any toothless old rake chuckle the rest is given over to criticism a mutilated melange of some of the views of Symons George Moore and others flavored with the compilator s own commonplaces I quote from the closing lines A specious and high sounding phrase has been invented to excuse the perversities of imaginative genius by speaking of its achievement as a conquest of new realms for the spirit But the worth of such acquisitions depends on the nature of the territory and if it be morally a malarial swamp conducive only to a human type found subversive in our normal world it will always appear to the English mind that we shall do well to forego the new kingdom and to withhold our homage from its discoverer That nice is nasty nasty nice and the creative artist the sole arbiter must be hotly opposed so long as a social conscience survives And this was written in Anno Domini A sense of fairness urges me to rehabilitate the English mind by recalling a passage from Mr Thorley s compatriot Arthur Symons The artist it cannot be too clearly understood has no more part in society than a monk in domestic life he cannot be judged by its rules he can be neither praised nor blamed for his acceptance or rejection of its conventions Social rules are made by normal people for normal people and the man of genius is fundamentally abnormal It is high time that this axiom became a truism and that we cease to measure the artist with the yard stick of conventional morality L art mes enfants c est d tre absolument soi m me sang Verlaine and somewhere else he reveals a bit of that self with his usual sincerity I believe and I sin in thought as in action I believe and I repent in thought if no more Or again I believe and I am a good Christian at this moment I believe and I am a bad Christian the instant after The remembrance the hope the invocation of a sin delights me with or without remorse sometimes under the very form of sin and hedged with all its natural consequences This delight it pleases us to put to paper and publish more or less well expressed we consign it in short into literary form forgetting all religious ideas or not letting one of them escape us Can any one in good faith condemn us as poets A hundred times no And indeed I should echo a hundred times no exclaims the Englishman Arthur Symons I cannot resist the temptation of quoting the happiest definition of Verlaine s personality written by Charles Morice back in The soul of an immortal child that is the soul of Verlaine with all the privileges and all the perils of so being with the sudden despair so easily distracted the vivid gaieties without a cause the excessive suspicions and the excessive confidences the whims so easily outwearied the deaf and blind infatuations with especially the unceasing renewal of impressions in the incorruptible integrity of personal vision and sensation Years influences teachings may pass over a temperament such as this may irritate it may fatigue it transform it never never so much as to alter that particular unity which consists in a dualism in the division of forces between the longing after what is evil and the adoration of what is good or rather in the antagonism of spirit and flesh I have not mentioned the most striking feature of Mr Thorley s production the appendix Six of Verlaine s poems are translated by him for the benefit of those who do not understand French intimately To offer them to other readers would of course be an impertinence he modestly admits Impertinence is not the word for that outrage I have experienced physical pain at the sight of the Hunnish sacrilege committed by this well wishing moralist The poet for whom De la musique avant toute chose De la musique encore et toujours who had pleaded Car nous voulons la nuance encore Pas la couleur rien que la nuance has been mercilessly crucified in the form of quasi Tennysonian taffy like verses One recalls with gratitude the careful albeit pale translations of Gertrude Hall who at least had the sense of sthetic propriety in endeavoring to remain true to the master s meter and rhythm From Tolstoy s diary in a great a stupendous idea to the realization of which I feel myself capable of devoting all my life The idea is the foundation of a new religion corresponding to the development of mankind the religion of Jesus but purified from dogma and mysticism a practical religion not promising bliss in future but giving happiness on earth To work consciously for the union on earth by religion From a letter to the poet Fet in I am so different to things of this life that life becomes uninteresting I hope you will love me though I be black From the fragment There are no guilty people There was a time when I tried to change my position which was not in harmony with my conscience but the conditions created by the past by my family and its claims upon me were so complicated that I did not know how to free myself I had not the strength Now that I am over eighty and have become feeble I have given up trying to free myself Strange to say as my feebleness increases I realize more and more strongly the wrongfulness of my position and it grows more and more intolerable to me On his death bed at the railroad station Astapovo November I am tired of this world of men Tolstoy s failure was inevitable for he had approached life with the uncompromising logic of a child or a god For fifty years he preached his religion and during all that time he remained splendidly inconsistent He opposed private property and proceeded to live on his estate he had denounced marriage and was a father to thirteen children Notwithstanding his deadly hatred for the Russian government he bitterly denounced the liberals and the revolutionists for their un Christian ways of fighting the enemy but his greatest contradiction to the joy of the intellectual world consisted in the victory of the artist over the moralist as manifested in his numerous novels and plays The work of Edward Garnett is conscientious and is to my knowledge the best short biography of Tolstoy It was a happy idea to discard the traditional portrait and use a reproduction of Kramskoy s painting which dates back to the sixties if I am not mistaken It is when looking at this portrait a great piece of art in itself that we envisage the author of War and Peace A few words from the description of Tolstoy s face by P A Terzeyeonvo His face was a true peasant s face simple rustic with a broad nose a weather beaten skin and thick overhanging brows from beneath which small keen grey eyes peered sharply forth One instantly divines in Tolstoy a man of the highest society with polished unconstrained manners On the one hand an insatiable thirst for power over people and on the other an unconquerable ardor for inward purity and the sweetness of meekness In this chain of seething imperious instincts linked with delicate spiritual organization lies the profound tragicness of Tolstoy s personality Mr Garnett succeeds in giving the quintessence of Tolstoy s works and teachings in less than a hundred pages Like most of the Russian s eulogistic biographers Mr Garnett has not escaped the fallacy of exaggerating the moral power that Tolstoy exercised over the government To say that the Czar and his ministers dared not touch the outspoken anarchist and heretic out of dread of Europe nay of Russia is to reveal one s ignorance of the brazen defiance displayed by Muscovite autocrats in regard to public opinion As the Germans put it Herr Kossack sch men Sie sich Tolstoy as a matter of fact had helped to check the revolutionary spirit of his compatriots in a greater degree than the tyrannic persecutions of Von Plehve Had he not appealed time and again to embrace his doctrine of Non Resistance Had he not denounced the revolutionists as violent prototypes of their hangers Could the government see any danger in a man who wrote in The Times during the revolution of To free oneself from the government it is only necessary to abstain from participating in it and supporting it Our consciousness of the law of God demands from us only one thing moral self perfection i e the liberation of oneself from all those weaknesses and vices which make one the slave of governments and the participation in their crimes Another tragic contradiction of the restless soul of the anarchist who despite himself renders aid to the despots Alexander S Kaun INTROSPECTION Chance by Joseph Conrad Doubleday Page Company New York Did you ever take supper in the apartments of a dear bachelor friend on a night when the wind howled outside the window and the rain beat against the pane And after the satisfying meal whose perfect appointment made you forget all save the luxury of living did you retire to the spacious living room and after accepting an aromatic Havana stretch your feet out to the crackling log fire and as the smoke from your cigar crawled upward listen to the philosophical analyses of your cultured host on that marvelously simple and profoundly complex servant and master of man the human mind Of such an evening is the atmosphere of Chance Not academically deep but deep from the standpoint of a full life and an active intelligence Everyone loves to analyze his fellow creatures Some do it well some do it badly but we all do it Conrad does it masterfully There doesn t seem to be a type which holds a mystery for him The village pillar the frail ill fated maid the buxsom housewife the silent captain ashore and afloat the opinionated retired old gentleman the cynical good natured man of thirty five the flat tintless fraud Into the mental realm of all these he makes expeditions long and short His characters live They mingle good and bad and as strong characters should weave for themselves a charming story of love adventure trial and victory never trite and always surprising It is a tale built of character studies and garnished with odd conjective philosophy Our new acquaintance paused then added meditatively Queer man As if it made any difference Queer man It s certainly unwise to admit any sort of responsibility for our actions whose consequences we are never able to foresee remarked Marlow by way of assent The consequence of his action was that I got a ship said the other That could not do much harm he added with a laugh which argued a probably unconscious contempt of general ideas But Marlow was not put off He was patient and reflective He had been at sea many years and I verily believe he liked sea life because upon the whole it is favourable to reflection I am speaking of the now nearly vanished sea life under sail To those who may be surprised at the statement I will point out that this life secured for the mind of him who embraced it the inestimable advantages of solitude and silence Marlow had the habit of pursuing general ideas in a peculiar manner between jest and earnest Oh I wouldn t suggest he said that your namesake Mr Powell the Shipping Master had done you much harm Such was hardly his intention And even if it had been he would not have had the power He was but a man and the incapacity to achieve anything distinctly good or evil is inherent in our earthly condition Mediocrity is our mark And perhaps it s just as well since for the most part we cannot be certain of the effect of our actions I don t know about the effect the other stood up to Marlow manfully What effect did you expect anyhow I tell you he did something uncommonly kind He did what he could Marlow retorted gently and on his own showing that was not a very great deal I cannot help thinking that there was some malice in the way he seized the opportunity to serve you He managed to make you uncomfortable You wanted to go to sea but he jumped on the chance of accommodating your desire with a vengeance I am inclined to think your cheek alarmed him And this was an excellent occasion to suppress you altogether For if you accepted he was relieved of you with every appearance of humanity and if you made objections after requesting his assistance mind you it was open to him to drop you as a sort of impostor You might have had to decline that berth for some very valid reason From sheer necessity perhaps The notice was too uncommonly short But under the circumstances you d have covered yourself with ignominy Our new friend knocked the ashes out of his pipe There is something about Conrad which gives a warm feeling about the heart A certain fineness of humor a certain fullness of sympathy He never mixes his similes they always take the same tone and the same color For instance I took a piece of cake and went out to bribe the Fyne dog into some sort of self control His sharp comical yapping was unbearable like stabs through one s brain and Fyne s deeply modulated remonstrances abashed the vivacious animal no more than the deep patient murmur of the sea abashes a nigger minstrel on a popular beach Fyne was beginning to swear at him in low sepulchral tones when I appeared The dog became at once wildly demonstrative half strangling himself in his collar his eyes and tongue hanging out in the excess of his uncomprehensible affection for me This was before he caught sight of the cake in my hand A series of vertical springs high up in the air followed and then when he got the cake he instantly lost his interest in everything else No this illustration is not of Conrad s finest but in a homely way it illustrates a deep sympathy with life which this strong worker and writer gives in such bountiful measure in all his literature and to quote an eminent writer Literature and Conrad are interchangeable terms Henry Blackman Sell AN AMERICAN NOVEL Clark s Field by Robert Herrick Houghton Mifflin Company Boston It was but the other day that Mr Herrick told us what he thought about the American novel Those who read the trenchant article found not only a criticism of our machine like fictionists and their half baked methods but also a sturdy conviction that the day was surely approaching when we should demand and receive a truer and more vital presentation of our national life in our literature And if Mr Herrick long since tagged an apostate to our national creed of turgid optimism believes this we can safely trust to his cool vision and be glad that the tide has turned The rich human material lies ready at hand and the audience is fast growing intelligent and discriminating As yet however we await the writer or writers keen enough to perceive the opportunity powerful enough to interest the public in what it has been unwilling to heed and of course endowed with sufficient insight to comprehend our big new world Whatever may be said for our other novelists surely not one of them can exhibit a mingling of the powers of insight and artistry equal to that of Robert Herrick His work from the beginning has been an honest and incisive attempt to interpret our life in its peculiar and universal aspects in spite of the clamor of the public at his tearing away of the veils of sentimentality and prudery The errors into which he fell were due to the ardor of his spiritual vision which drove him into an impassioned taking of sides He has emerged from that stage into what his critics call his old manner a more objective treatment of his material But in the process of change something was lost the element of flaming intensity which gave the reader a similar capacity to feel In this latest performance as well as in One Woman s Life he is always cool clear sighted and admirably efficient in the task he sets himself but never passionate On the contrary despite the pervading atmosphere of earnestness he often assumes a playful satiric tone mordant but not bitter a method well suited to his matter and purpose Clark s Field tells the story of the influence of property upon the human beings who own it and hope to reap gold from its increasing value All that is left of the great Clark farm is a fifty acre field in a growing New England town bequeathed jointly to the two brothers Edward and Samuel the former of whom has emigrated to the West and wholly disappeared from the ken of his relatives So at first the tale is of the baleful influence of expectation delayed again and again in the case of Samuel who cannot sell the land because of his brother s half interest and who in consequence sinks into a sodden inertia in his son s disintegration into a lazy and drunken Vet in his sister Addie s sordid and pathetic sally into life resulting in the birth of another human being destined to taste of the fruit of their tree and to find it one day very bitter The greater portion of the novel then deals with the influence of the realized wealth upon the unformed colorless little girl Adelle the last of the Clarks It is a masterly piece of work the gradual development of the pale rooming house drudge into the silly and insolent woman of fashion and slowly but certainly into a human being with a soul Less promising stuff for a heroine neither fate nor Mr Herrick could have chosen the latter delights in ample admissions throughout the book of Adelle s lack of beauty brains and charm Yet he is always sufficiently temperate to escape the danger of caricature Adelle is a convincing figure The slow dawning upon her consciousness of the power of money her magic lamp which she need only rub to gratify any desire is followed by swift and constant use of the new weapon It brings her a fresh assurance a few scatter brained friends some stylish clothes and at length a callow youth for a husband It never brings her contact with a real person or friendship with a stimulating individual nor can it save her from the failure of her marriage nor compensate her for the death of her little boy Adelle s story then turns out to be what we least expected it a hopeful one It leaves us with almost a sense of security for is she not one of those who can derive good from her mistakes and therefore the safest sort of human being to raise in this garden plot of souls And although we are still saddled with that absurd code of inheritance and property rights that the Anglo Saxon peoples have preserved from their ancient tribal days in the gloomy forests of the lower Rhine the situation is not without hope since it has yielded a man of the judge s type in whom the beauty of a past idealism is coupled with the freshness of a new vision of responsibility To hark back to the recent article in The Yale Review we believe that Mr Herrick himself has given us an American novel thoroughly American in situation character treatment and even in philosophy We as a people are beginning to suspect our boastful optimism as we become aware of the sordidness beneath the fair exterior of our glorious civilization And in accordance with the western temperament the awareness of wrong leads not to bitter cynicism but to sturdy efforts toward amelioration Such then is the spirit of Clark s Field a hopefulness in the power of courage and labor and a growing sense of social responsibility to move mounds that seem to have become immovable mountains through a tenacious fostering of tradition Marguerite Swawite THE SAVAGE PAINTERS Cubists and Post Impressionism by Arthur Jerome Eddy A C McClurg and Company Chicago An attempt to explain the new schools in art in plain every day terms An earnest appeal for tolerance in regard to seemingly perversive forms The book has a wealth of material and numerous quotations from Picasso Picabia C zanne Matisse and others considerably more interesting and instructive than Mr Eddy s own truisms Although the author repeatedly resents any accusation in his adherence to Cubism the reader gets the impression that the Cubistic movement has received a more thorough and fair treatment than the other new schools Of the sixty nine reproductions of Post Impressionistic paintings and sculpture only five represent the Futurists Idillon Redon who gave us the greater delight in last year s International Exhibition is totally ignored Among the Self Portraits that of Matisse is sorely missed a work that helps greatly in understanding the quaint painter of the Woman in Red Madras Whether Mr Eddy will succeed in convincing the prejudiced conservatives is doubtful but in those who have appreciated the daring attempts of the new schools his book will arouse a renewed longing for the foreign savages and an ardent hope for their further invasions in our sane and healthful galleries THE SAME BOOK FROM ANOTHER STANDPOINT With apologies to the author of Tender Buttons Oil and Water Enough water is plenty and more more is almost plenty

ROOSEVELT THE GREAT AMERICAN CHANTECLIER SHALL AWAKE TO FIND THE SUN HIGH IN HEAVEN AND THAT HE HAD CROWED NOT A CHANGE OF PRICE With the August issue the sixth month of our very flourishing life we have decided to make one important change in The Little Review We are reducing the subscription price to a year and that of single copies to cents There will be no change in size or appearance Those whose subscriptions have already been paid on the former basis will be continued for another half year Our reason for doing so is this We have discovered that a great many of the people whom we wish to reach cannot afford to pay a year for a magazine It happens that we are very emphatic about wanting these people in our audience and we believe they are as sincerely interested in The Little Review as we are stimulated by having them among our readers Therefore we are going to become more accessible With characteristic lack of modesty we wish also to make another announcement Our success so far has exceeded even our own hopes and it may be remembered that they were rather high As for our practical friends who warned us against starting a literary magazine even their dark prophecies of debt and a speedy demise have had to dissolve before our statements that we have paid our bills with what The Little Review has earned in its six months of existence that we are free of debt that we even have money in the bank and a subscription list that acts like a live thing But we want more We want everyone who might like The Little Review to hear about it Therefore We want interested readers to be interested to the point of bringing in others We want intelligent spokesmen in every city in the country to tell people about the magazine and to get their subscriptions Anyone sending in three yearly subscriptions will be given a year s subscription free Or he may make a commission of per cent on every subscription he gets College girls ought to find the field a very workable one during their summer vacations Every ten subscriptions will mean to the energetic young woman who pursues her friends with accounts of The Little Review s value and charm We are trying to make a magazine that is unacademic enthusiastic appreciative and critical in the real sense that seeks and emphasizes the beauty which is truth and insists upon a larger naturalness and a nobler seriousness in art and in life We know there is room for such a magazine and we ask you to help us in advertising it THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WALT WHITMAN AUTHORIZED BY THE EXECUTORS COMPLETE LEAVES OF GRASS This edition contains
